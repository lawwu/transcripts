[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.300]   - Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's a live Q&A.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:51.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.360]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.320]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.160]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.560]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.120]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.160]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.560]   Today is Friday, February 16, 2024.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.740]   And on this Friday, after a multi-week hiatus,
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.200]   we do live Q&A.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.180]   You call in, talk about anything you want,
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.000]   any questions, any topics, it's up to you.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.320]   If you don't know what to call in and talk about,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.260]   well, welcome to my world.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.280]   I actually really enjoy doing these Friday Q&A shows
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.120]   'cause they're easy for me
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.700]   'cause I don't have to pick the topic.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.960]   (laughs)
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.280]   It's not hard for me to record podcasts.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.680]   It's hard for me to choose the topics to record podcasts on
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.840]   because there's so many twists and turns.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.920]   Oh, I could talk about this, but I could talk about that,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.960]   or how much should I talk about it, et cetera.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.460]   Showing up to Friday shows is easy
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.840]   because you have to do all that work.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480]   You have to decide what we talk about.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.320]   If you would like to join me
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.400]   in one of these Friday Q&A shows,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.880]   you could do that by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.920]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.820]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.060]   That will gain access for you to these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.700]   I do that just to meter the amount of calls
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.220]   to an appropriate number
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.980]   so that we don't wind up with 25 callers on the line,
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.300]   et cetera, and it's something that I can't do.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.280]   So please go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.860]   We begin today with Dan in Colorado.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.700]   Dan, welcome to the show.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.180]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.740]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks so much.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.260]   I am 32 years old.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.380]   I have a two-year-old and a seven-month-old.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.880]   I currently work remotely,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.080]   have a salary of about 150,000 with a 10 to 20% bonus.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.920]   My wife works remotely part-time
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.160]   with a really flexible schedule,
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.920]   and then she takes care of the boys the rest of the time.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.800]   We plan to move close to our family this spring,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.960]   but my boss recently offered me a promotion
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.120]   that I would need to move to a different city for.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.680]   It's a vice president, executive-level role
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.240]   that would roughly double my salary,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   come with a much larger bonus,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.980]   and would also include some ownership in a company
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.980]   that is likely to IPO in the next year.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.820]   - Awesome.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.740]   - Thanks.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.940]   We saved a lot of money in our 20s.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.300]   Pretty comfortable.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   I also have a side business with a FinTech product
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.540]   that is about to hit the market,
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.820]   and I expect it to do really well.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.220]   I really like the lifestyle of working remotely,
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.060]   but with the new job,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.820]   I would need to go into the office two or three days a week.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.060]   Not really a big deal.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.500]   My initial thought, though, was to turn the position down
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.220]   so that we could still move kind of close to our family
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.340]   like we intended,
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.320]   but after sitting with it for a while,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.920]   I'm kind of wondering if I'm crazy
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   for not taking a role like this,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.180]   especially since it's the first quarter of my career.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.760]   Certainly be among the youngest VPs in the industry,
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   and the title could lend some additional credibility
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.200]   to my side venture,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.920]   and would absolutely make it easier
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.960]   to get another VP gig at any point in my life after this.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.680]   So, three quick questions.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.440]   Would I be crazy for not taking this if I decided not to,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.400]   or would I be crazy for taking it?
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.820]   Either way, I guess.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.540]   If I were to take the job for a year or two,
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.060]   just to get the street cred,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.340]   and then would moving a two-year-old
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.380]   and a seven-month-old out and then back
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.700]   be an okay thing to do?
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.580]   I think it is,
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.500]   but it might be nice to hear somebody else say that.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.980]   And then finally, if I were to negotiate a schedule
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.700]   where I could be in the new city for a month
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.780]   and then back home for one to two months,
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.340]   would moving my family back and forth that often
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.260]   for a couple of years be irresponsible in your opinion?
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.840]   - When you talk about moving your family
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.400]   to be back home or close to the rest of your family,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.640]   specifically, which family members are you referring to?
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.960]   How many of them are there?
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.680]   And what does close mean?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   - Good question.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.200]   Yeah, so it's basically everyone.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.640]   It's both of our parents.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.760]   So, all the grandparents,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.200]   all of our siblings, and their children.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   And we would be within about two hours of them initially,
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.500]   'cause we were gonna move to our vacation property
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.180]   for a year or two.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.300]   We have a lot of projects going on out there.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.940]   So, it'd be easily within a weekend drive,
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.760]   whereas we are not now.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.420]   With about three to four years out
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.940]   when my older son starts kindergarten,
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.640]   we would move probably back into the same county.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.940]   - Okay.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.380]   First thing is, I don't know how to answer the question
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.020]   of living close to family
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.980]   in any kind of financial framework.
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.040]   And I don't know that I have any kind
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.540]   of broadly applicable framework.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.380]   So, let me just kind of lay out a couple of thoughts
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.980]   to consider as we talk about it.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.980]   First, let's acknowledge that moving close to family
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.580]   would ordinarily be considered by most people
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.900]   a positive thing to do,
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.580]   unless there's some kind of dysfunctional
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.620]   or toxic family, et cetera.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.260]   Generally speaking, we appreciate that we want
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.300]   to be close to those that we're most dear to,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.580]   that we love those who we're most dear to.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.860]   And so, that generally, I think, is a positive thing.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.420]   And the fact that all of your family is together
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.740]   in one place, meaning both sides of the family,
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.500]   across the board, that creates an enormous attraction
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.860]   because those relationships for you and for your wife
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.500]   and for your children, those relationships
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.640]   will be very productive and helpful,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.780]   especially in these early years of you having some help,
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.540]   some relief, interactions, friends,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.380]   people that you know well, et cetera.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.040]   So, that's a positive, beneficial thing.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.140]   I don't know that that is always
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.380]   the determining factor, though.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.720]   I've wrestled with this a lot.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.380]   I don't currently live close to my family,
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.420]   and I've repeatedly questioned my own motives
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.020]   'cause I could live anywhere.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.740]   And the question is, why don't I live close to my family?
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.860]   If I believe what I just said, which I do,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.220]   that living near family is useful and helpful
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.620]   and productive, et cetera, then why don't I, myself,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.460]   at this time, live close to my family?
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.220]   Part of it is that I did for a long time,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.380]   and without getting into my story,
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.620]   just saying that I guess the reason
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.060]   is you need to have some kind of strong reason not to.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.900]   And so, there can be many reasons,
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300]   and no one is out here judging your decisions,
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.700]   but you'd wanna have some reason
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.820]   as to why you're not living close to family.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.060]   And you have something of a reason,
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.940]   and that's what you're wrestling with.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.100]   You didn't have a great alternative choice,
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.180]   and so the previous plan was move close to family.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.800]   Now, all of a sudden, you've got a really strong job offer,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.020]   can advance your career,
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.180]   could possibly be a shorter-term thing.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.100]   Now you have a good, compelling reason
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.140]   to consider an alternative.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.940]   And I'm not gonna be the guy to tell you
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.660]   what you should or shouldn't do,
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.260]   just that it's fine, I think, to consider it as you are.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.020]   And at the end of the day,
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.380]   the basic thought that I have on that subject
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.660]   is that living close to family doesn't seem to me
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.460]   like a goal in and of itself
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.820]   that really should make the difference.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.100]   And I've wrestled with this a lot with my own children,
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.380]   is that is my goal in raising children,
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.960]   is my goal to raise them so that they can live next to me
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.980]   for the rest of their life?
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.740]   And when I put it in kind of a blunt and crass way,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.700]   I think most people would say,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.180]   "Well, no, that's not my goal."
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.500]   So what is my goal?
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.660]   Well, I want to enjoy relationship with my children,
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.700]   but I also want my children to do something
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.780]   and to impact the world.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.620]   We're here on mission.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.180]   We've got a job to do.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.440]   And so that's the standard
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.100]   that I'm gonna apply to my own children.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.580]   I'm gonna say that I'm not bringing you into the world
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.240]   so that you can be my next-door neighbors
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.180]   as our highest and best goal.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.700]   I'm bringing you into the world
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.220]   so that you can serve mankind
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.300]   so that we can transform the world.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.660]   We're on a mission.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.200]   And so to me, in that light,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.900]   it seems perfectly reasonable for me to look forward
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   to close relationships with my children,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.900]   but I'm not gonna hold my children
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.900]   to some standard that exists in my mind
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.620]   that somehow the height of family goals and future
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.060]   is to be my next-door neighbor.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.640]   That's not the goal.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.340]   The goal is that you do something in the world
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.180]   and that you fulfill your purpose in the world.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.580]   God put you here for a reason
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.780]   and you have a purpose, something to do,
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.140]   and I'm gonna support you in that.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.900]   And if that means we can do that,
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.980]   being my next-door neighbor
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.500]   and laboring together in something, wonderful.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.660]   And if that means that you're gonna go
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.260]   to the other side of the world
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.920]   and do something on the other side of the world,
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.220]   absolutely, I'm gonna support you.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.940]   And we're gonna look to enjoy as much fellowship
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.740]   and relationship between us as we possibly can.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.700]   That would be the first thing.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.620]   The second thing is,
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.060]   do I need my family at this point in time?
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.940]   And so you got a wife with a two-year-old
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.580]   and a seven-month-old.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.460]   Let's say you have another baby next year.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.660]   All of a sudden, her life's pretty intense.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.620]   And so there may be a phase of life
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.500]   in which she really needs some help.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.380]   And maybe being near family
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.860]   could be a really important component of that.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.460]   Or it might be the opposite.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.220]   It might be that other things are better.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.500]   So you should always look at your family,
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   look at your wife, just ask,
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.980]   do we need our family's help at this point in time?
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.140]   But I don't think that the goal
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.140]   is to always be specifically there.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.420]   That's not the life goal.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.920]   And so if there's purpose
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.140]   in your making an alternative choice
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.820]   and one of the costs is going to be distance
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.580]   in your family relationships,
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.260]   to me, that seems an acceptable decision
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.820]   if that's what you decide.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.580]   The reason I ask about distance is quite simply,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.500]   I think there's an enormous difference
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.900]   in the lifestyle that you have
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.220]   if you're two hours away from family
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.980]   versus if you are 15 minutes away from family
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.740]   versus if you are three-minute walk away from family.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.140]   And what I have experienced
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.860]   and observed from a lot of people
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.220]   is that the idea of being close to family
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.100]   actually, in reality, turns out to be,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.620]   well, we see each other once a month.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.340]   And you say, well, is this really the key?
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.460]   And then instead of actually doing something together,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.260]   being intimately involved in one another's lives
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.100]   and pursuing similar goals,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.420]   it often turns into, well, we watch the Super Bowl together
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.780]   and that's about it.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.100]   And we have these superficial relationships
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.700]   and superficial contact.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.740]   And so you should judge your family relationships
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.980]   and ask, is there going to be something
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.980]   where we're genuinely going to be working together
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.420]   in a close way,
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.020]   or are we just going to be living in the same town?
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.940]   And if you're two hours away,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.740]   you're probably not seeing them weekly.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.900]   If you are seeing them weekly,
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.740]   it's going to feel like a real burden
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.260]   and it's going to take real effort for you to say,
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.180]   on Saturday morning,
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.940]   we're going to drive over to the next town over.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.980]   On Sunday morning, we're going to drive
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.580]   to the next two hours away.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.900]   And that's something you're going to do
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.220]   once or twice a month.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.580]   So now all of a sudden you're down quite a lot.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.100]   And so in terms of strategy,
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.300]   my point is that if you can quite literally live
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.420]   walking distance to your parents
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.900]   so that your children can just run in
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.500]   and out of their house all the time,
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.300]   and anytime you need to step out,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.100]   you can call them over to take care of the children.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.500]   And maybe you send your six-year-old over
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.820]   to work with grandpa on his math exercises, et cetera.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.820]   That's a much more worthy being close to family
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.260]   than is being 20 minutes away or being two hours away.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.620]   And so that's why I ask those questions.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.140]   Now, to the specific things,
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.340]   are you crazy to take or to not take?
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.260]   No, I don't think you're crazy to take or to not take.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.700]   You are young and your career
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.620]   is an enormous component of your life.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.380]   And it is not wrong to prioritize career advancement.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.980]   Career advancement and your accepting responsibility
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.100]   when it is offered to you,
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.020]   that is an important component
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.260]   of why you're here on this earth.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.860]   Certainly the money and the additional financial power
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.820]   that you accumulate with higher salary
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.700]   and with more savings,
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.460]   that will be an important component of your work.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.580]   But also just simply having more power
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.740]   and more status and authority in your company
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.460]   and in your career is an important thing for you to embrace,
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.020]   especially as young as you are.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.700]   Because most careers properly managed
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.260]   work on a ratcheting mechanism,
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.660]   is that once you reach a certain status,
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.260]   a certain job description, I'm a vice president of XYZ,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260]   a certain salary, a certain type of work environment,
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.580]   then you're often not going to go beneath that.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.700]   And for you to accomplish your purpose in life,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.460]   as long as you don't feel like you're in the wrong career
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.540]   or the wrong business or something like that,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.460]   you want to embrace responsibility
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.940]   whenever it's offered to you.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.260]   And so I didn't have, years ago,
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.540]   this is a major change that I made in the last 10 years.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.860]   Years ago, I thought that the point of working
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.180]   was to get financially independent so I could quit working.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.380]   I now don't see it that way.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.820]   And I think I was foolish and naive
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.660]   to formally even consider that as an appropriate scenario.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.660]   Rather, you need to bear responsibility,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.940]   and bearing responsibility in society
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.460]   and in your community and in your company, et cetera,
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.220]   is going to mean saying yes to additional responsibility
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.420]   when it's offered to you.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.140]   And so your default answer to that should be yes.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.620]   And it's only if there's a strong, compelling reason
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.020]   not to do that, as in, my wife is sick and dying
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.100]   and I've got to care for her,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.220]   or my children are heading into a ditch
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.540]   and I got to rescue them,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.020]   or my parents desperately need me, or something like that.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.060]   Then the general default should be say yes
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.340]   to more responsibility because that will broaden your impact
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.980]   in your family, your community, and in the world around.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.780]   And it's a good thing.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.940]   Number two, if you work for one or two more years
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.060]   and then move, would that work?
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.180]   I think absolutely.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.020]   Now, you should consider, of course,
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.460]   things like the age of your parents.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.180]   Are your parents younger or older?
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.260]   We, none of us, know how long our parents would live.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.460]   But if your parents are, say, 50 years old,
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.220]   and there's a decent chance
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.940]   that they're gonna have a long and healthy life,
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.260]   then now it's easier for you to stay away
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.020]   for another couple of years until you make this move.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.140]   If your parents are 99 years old,
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.820]   well, and they don't know your children,
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.620]   then now there's more of a reason for you to move closer.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.500]   But doing this for one or two more years,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.100]   I think is absolutely, absolutely great.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.620]   I don't think that there's any reason to give much thought
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.900]   to what children need in a specific location
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.780]   until you reach the early teenage years,
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.340]   something like 12 years old or so.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.340]   And what I mean by that is that if you have a four-year-old
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.980]   and you move your four-year-old across the country,
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.300]   and your four-year-old's best friend
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.780]   that he played with every day becomes someone else,
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.220]   is that harmful to the child?
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.780]   I don't think so.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.780]   And I don't think that you need to worry too much
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.300]   about really almost any of those things
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.980]   until you, again, reach those early teen years
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.580]   where a child is starting to develop
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.140]   an independent vision of life,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.500]   of what his life is going to look like
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.460]   after he passes out of your immediate family.
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.420]   And that's where you wanna be thoughtful about,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.540]   how can I help this child enhance his career?
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.460]   How can I help him pursue the path
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.940]   that's gonna be best for him?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.300]   I need to be respectful of his wishes
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.220]   and his vision for his life, things like that,
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.940]   in addition to just what's best for the family.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.180]   But up until that point,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.660]   I think that you should just consider
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.420]   your family unit as a whole,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.900]   and you don't need to worry too much
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.740]   about moving people around, et cetera.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.540]   You can figure out the best circumstances
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.900]   in any particular schedule.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.100]   And then number three, negotiating the schedule
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.620]   for one month here, one month there, et cetera.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.700]   I don't know, you would have to test that out.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.260]   What I would say is that it's probably more stressful
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.220]   on your family than it will be on you.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.300]   You can come and go pretty easily,
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.860]   but unless you have a really great home in both places,
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.260]   then that's gonna be super stressful.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.320]   So just as like a practical discussion of this,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.940]   my wife and I, we've done quite a lot of traveling
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.220]   with young children.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.100]   And generally speaking, my wife doesn't enjoy it,
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.580]   and I don't really enjoy it either,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.340]   but a lot with young children.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.500]   But the reason is that when you have one space
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.300]   that you know, you know what the risks are,
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.980]   you know what's there, you know what the toys are,
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.860]   you know where the boundaries are, et cetera,
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.180]   that makes your job as a parent of young children
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.780]   a lot easier.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.740]   My wife didn't enjoy traveling around the country in an RV,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.580]   because even though we had an RV,
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.180]   she didn't have any continuity
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.940]   between what was outside of the RV.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.740]   So you can't just send the children off randomly
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.700]   to go ride their bikes,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.940]   because you don't know what's out there.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.780]   You have to go out and scout it for danger
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.540]   and try to figure out what's appropriate, what's here.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.220]   So that just adds a lot of work
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.860]   to caring for little children.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.300]   Whereas if you're in one place, one home,
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.740]   and we know where all the toys are,
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.600]   and the children have their own things,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.260]   then they can be a little bit more independent,
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.300]   and that really reduces the burden on the parents
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.820]   when you are in one place.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.100]   And so I'm skeptical that kind of flipping back and forth,
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.620]   unless you're going between two houses that you own,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.580]   that you have a good infrastructure set up in both places,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.180]   I'm skeptical of that being a productive lifestyle.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.980]   - All right, perfect, man.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.700]   Yeah, totally agree with all of that.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.380]   And you always offer some new insight, too.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.540]   So really appreciate it.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.500]   - My pleasure.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.380]   At its core, if we're gonna do anything,
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.860]   then we need to have a reason for doing it.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.300]   And so being close to family
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.720]   needs to be part of the broader purpose,
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.320]   not the sole and exclusive thing,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   unless there's a clear,
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.840]   again, service-related focus to it.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.400]   And I'll keep working on it.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.680]   I reassess continually my own decisions, et cetera.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.840]   But, and I'm not sure of these answers that I'm giving you.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.760]   It's just the best that I've given you,
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.100]   and I've tried to explain it as clearly as I'm able.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.000]   We move to Taylor in Alabama.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.840]   Taylor, welcome to the show.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.680]   How can I serve you today?
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.040]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.980]   I wanted to see if you might have some thoughts
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.640]   about allowances for kids.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.220]   And in particular, in my situation,
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.640]   I've got 13-year-old daughters, twins, seventh grade,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.320]   and we've never given them an allowance before,
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.440]   but we're thinking that they're getting to an age
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.680]   where it might be nice for them
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.600]   to have to kind of budget their money a little bit
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.200]   and learn how to use a bank accountant.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.160]   Perhaps a debit card, other things like that.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.920]   And so I've looked into it a little bit.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.680]   I've seen a lot of differing advice
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.600]   about the best way to structure it,
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.400]   the best mechanics of how to do it.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.080]   I guess, first of all, do you think it's a good idea at all?
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.480]   But anyway, I figure you probably do have some ideas
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.360]   and wanted to see if you could share 'em.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.320]   - Yeah, I'll make this fairly concise,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.840]   'cause I think it's relatively straightforward.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.540]   To begin with, I was never given an allowance
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.500]   when I was young.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.820]   And I think, I'd have to confirm this with my parents,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.960]   but basically, I think my parents
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.600]   probably would have been sympathetic to the viewpoint
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.000]   of simply saying that if you give,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.380]   we're not welfare, we're not giving out welfare here.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.960]   I think Dave Ramsey at least used to say this.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.960]   I would assume he still does,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.000]   unless he's changed on something.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.120]   But he'd say, I'm not giving out welfare to my children.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.760]   So giving money to my children
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.160]   doesn't seem like the right pathway.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.740]   And that's a common mindset,
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.260]   especially common in our US American culture,
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.660]   where we believe strongly in instilling a work ethic
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.660]   into our children and so we don't wanna give away free money.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:16.060]   So that was my basic idea when I first had children.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.500]   I then came to see the other side
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.500]   and I realized that if I don't give my children money,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.080]   then they're not going to handle money
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.940]   until they can earn it for themselves.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.380]   And I realized that if I want my children to manage money,
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.460]   they're going to need practice and skill in managing money.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.500]   And so I decided that I would change
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.180]   and I decided that I would, in fact, give an allowance.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.980]   And my reason for deciding to give my children an allowance
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.420]   is that I want them to have money
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.740]   that they have to decide what to do with
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.080]   so that they can experience the joys of having money,
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.480]   using money, spending money, et cetera.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.800]   And I'm hoping that they will make lots and lots of mistakes
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.440]   with the handling of their money.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.300]   And so I'm hoping that they'll blow their money
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.320]   on stupid things.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.560]   I'm hoping that they'll waste it
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.320]   and feel the emotions of poorly considered purchases
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.640]   and things like that.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.680]   And I want those lessons to happen early.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.740]   I want them to happen at a young age, not till a later age.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.640]   Because when we talk about blowing it,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.140]   I want them to blow $2 on some worthless trinket
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.780]   and experience how it gets thrown away at it.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.860]   I don't want them to wait and blow $2,000
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.260]   on a worthless trinket when they're teenagers.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.780]   And so I realized that money management
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.620]   and the handling of money is a skill in and of itself
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.020]   that needs to be taught.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.220]   And in order for it to be taught,
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.160]   and since the children are gonna be too young
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.520]   to handle money, they need to be able
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.800]   to have money flowing through their hands.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.680]   Also, I want them to have money flowing through their hands
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.000]   over which they don't have full control.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.160]   And so I think the downside is if we wait,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.720]   let's say we wait until a child is 15
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.560]   and your daughter goes out and gets her first job at 15
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.600]   and she's got her paycheck
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.880]   and she brings home her paycheck and $400.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.180]   And then you try to tell her what to do with it.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.540]   Well, then there's a question is,
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.780]   do I have the right to tell her what to do with it?
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.540]   On the one hand, obviously, yes, she's a minor,
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.540]   you could tell her what to do with it,
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.940]   but we're respecting her person.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.740]   She's a young adult, et cetera.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.120]   And so we would be more thoughtful about,
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.700]   we would give advice, et cetera,
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.900]   but we would be more thoughtful.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.820]   But if you start when she's five,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.300]   then it's not such a big deal.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.260]   And so what I have done is I have given my children
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:48.260]   an allowance and then required them to spend the money
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.280]   in the way that I say.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.280]   And so I just split it into thirds
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.600]   and a third of the money we give away, they give away,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.400]   excuse me, a third of the money they give away,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.600]   I don't tell them who to give it to,
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.280]   I just tell them they gotta give it away.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.400]   A third of the money goes into their investment fund.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.640]   I don't tell them what that has to be invested in,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.000]   I just tell them it has to be invested
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.600]   and I explain what that means.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.380]   And then a third of the money goes into their spending fund.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.420]   And then in their spending fund,
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.080]   that's where they naturally save.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.380]   So we don't have a save jar.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.620]   It bothers me that people say,
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.620]   oh, we're gonna save money,
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.340]   but they're saving money for accumulation.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.900]   They're not saving money to grow it as a capital.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.920]   So I allow them to experience accumulation
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.580]   in their spending funds so that they can have the skill
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.300]   of saving money for things,
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.060]   bigger purchases that they wanna make,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.940]   but that's separate from investing.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.860]   And then I look to try to have opportunities
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.740]   for that money to flow through their hands.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.260]   So if we see somebody who needs money
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.340]   or we're aware of a need or something like that,
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.380]   then they can give it.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.420]   They have money that's set aside in advance
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.500]   for giving away to other people.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.660]   If they see a way to make money,
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.180]   then they have investment funds.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.820]   And my goal is that my children get richer
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.120]   every single year of their life.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.800]   Because what I tell them is that your investment capital
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.900]   is how you get richer,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.540]   is you put money into your investment capital.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.660]   As it grows, you start off with $10
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.420]   and you figure out, well, what can I buy and sell?
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.660]   So you go and you buy something for $10
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.960]   and you turn around and sell it for 20, okay.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.900]   Then we take the profits and we split those profits
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.920]   a third, a third, a third.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.000]   So a third gets given away,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.320]   a third gets set aside for spending,
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.060]   and a third goes back into the investment capital.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.480]   So then that investment capital should grow and grow,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.740]   and it should be hundreds of dollars
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.660]   when a child is, say, under 10.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.920]   It should be thousands of dollars
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.500]   when a child is in his or her teen age years,
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.320]   and it should be tens of thousands of dollars
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.420]   when a child is in his or her 20s.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.220]   And we wanna train the idea
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.320]   of looking for opportunities to invest money.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.780]   Like Jim Rohn said, you know,
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.740]   you should always have a bike to ride and a bike to rent.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.580]   Two bikes, one to ride, one to rent.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.400]   And so we wanna train children
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.500]   to look for opportunities to grow money,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.820]   and we can't do that if investing
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.840]   is just something that they get tossed at them
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.500]   at 15 years old.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.880]   It's a way of thinking that I think should be cultivated
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   from, say, four or five on, on a continual basis.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.760]   And then, so I believe in giving an allowance
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.600]   for that reason.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.960]   Now, I don't think that an allowance
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.480]   should be a permanent thing,
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.340]   nor do I think it should be a particularly luxurious thing.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.840]   But as a father, I find it a nice thing
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.980]   because it allows me to be more of a,
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.720]   a stick in the mud, in some cases,
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.460]   than I otherwise would be.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.300]   'Cause as a father,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.680]   you wanna give your children great things, right?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.320]   We spend lots of money on our children,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.760]   and we derive a great deal of joy and pleasure
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.300]   on spending money on them.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.660]   But if they don't have any money,
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.000]   then everything comes down to a decision of,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.160]   am I gonna make you happy by buying this for you,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.240]   or am I not gonna make you happy by buying this for you?
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.200]   So I find it really satisfying that my children have money,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.960]   and I've given them a modest amount of money,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.700]   and now they can go and do that.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.300]   Hey, you wanna go and buy that dumb trinket over there?
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.020]   I don't have to sit here and decide,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.640]   well, am I gonna hurt Johnny's future because I said no?
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.420]   Or fine, if you wanna buy it, you buy whatever you want.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.580]   If you have enough money, you're welcome to buy it.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.220]   And so I find it to be a useful parenting technique
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.700]   for me as well, to make sure that they have some money,
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.300]   'cause then they have to go through those choices.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.540]   And I always can get to choose more things that I give,
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.020]   et cetera, that's my prerogative as a parent.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.680]   Now, continuing on, I think this should change
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.400]   as time goes on.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.680]   I don't know, years ago, I thought,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.080]   well, we should just end the allowance entirely
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.640]   at, say, 12 years old, 'cause after all, you can work now,
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.080]   you should make your own money.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.000]   But then we move into, I think, a different expression.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.480]   The same reason that we started the allowance
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.280]   in the first place, under my thinking,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.760]   which is to have money flowing through your hands,
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.280]   is probably the same reason we should continue it.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.800]   But there should be more demands placed upon it.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.620]   And so I think part of training of a young adult
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.420]   needs to be to train a young adult to make proper decisions
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.100]   with the handling of money.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.100]   And so I think that as a parent,
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.540]   let's say you have a 14-year-old or 15-year-old,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.340]   there are certain things that you as a parent
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.480]   are obligated to do for your child.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.780]   For example, you're obligated to feed your child,
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.860]   you're obligated to clothe your child.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.080]   And so I think that those are things
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.220]   that you should decide your budget
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.700]   as to how much money you're going to spend on those things.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.220]   And then ideally, you should transition
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.640]   the control of those things over to your child.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.020]   And so your child should be responsible
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.980]   for purchasing her own clothing.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.020]   You know, your annual clothing budget,
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.300]   we're gonna spend $200 a quarter
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.620]   or whatever your family's number is,
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.620]   this is gonna be your clothing budget,
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.820]   this is the amount of money,
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.820]   and you're required to clothe yourself.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:05.460]   Now, you let her be the one who chooses
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.780]   where she gets the clothes.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.900]   Does she go to the expensive place or the inexpensive place?
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.780]   And then what she wears, how many outfits she buys,
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.180]   or whatever the application of this.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.220]   Obviously, you still have authority
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.220]   over her decisions on that.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.380]   But in general, your goal is to teach her a model.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.000]   You know, this is how a young lady dresses.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.720]   These are the kinds of clothes that are appealing.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.180]   These are the kinds of clothes that are becoming.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.940]   These are the kinds of things you should do.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.260]   Let me show you how to get a great value for them, et cetera.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.260]   But she should have experience doing those things.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.580]   And the money is, you're just changing
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.620]   the purchasing decisions out of your hands into her hands.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.220]   And then secondarily is that you're,
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.340]   or I mean also, not in secondary priority,
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.780]   but also then, you're working hard to find opportunities
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.740]   for your child to earn his or her own money.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.840]   And that's where the real money should come from,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.920]   is it should still be,
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.440]   I think the allowance should be reasonably high enough
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.240]   that there's enough money for your child
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   to buy the things that you can transition responsibility over
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.900]   for her to make the decisions on.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.880]   But it should be a low enough amount
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.920]   that she's still excited to get a job.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.320]   And when you get that first paycheck,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.280]   it should be enough money lumped together
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.480]   that it's exciting.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.240]   And those are the basic rules that I've come up with
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.120]   and the logic behind them.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.600]   At its core, money management is a skill.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.400]   It's not something that you're born with.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.600]   It's not innate and natural.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.860]   It's not like there's some people
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.440]   who are just naturally savers
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.720]   and some people who aren't.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.920]   I deny that entirely.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.760]   There may be people
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   who have an environmental compulsion in a certain direction,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.840]   but people who save money,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   save money because they've learned the skills
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   of saving money and they have enough reasons to save money.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.840]   People who don't save money don't save money
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.240]   because they don't have any reasons to save money
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.840]   and they haven't accumulated the skills of saving money.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.040]   And so what we should do is focus on laying out
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.840]   a clear vision of the reasons and goals
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.320]   as to how money gets handled in a young man or woman's life
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.960]   and then help them practice the skills on a continual basis
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.840]   until they become really good with them.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.180]   So I have changed.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.120]   I now support an allowance for that reason
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.400]   with the caveats that we're not just trying
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.800]   to get people accustomed to free money,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.760]   but we're trying to make money pass through their hands,
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.360]   recognizing that that's a component
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.180]   of our responsibility as parents.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.080]   - That sounds really good.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.600]   Those are sort of the ideas that I had in mind.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.320]   Do you also have any thoughts about the mechanics of it?
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.540]   Do you use cash?
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.240]   Do you use a debit card
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.560]   with some sort of shared bank account with them?
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   Or how do you do it?
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.280]   - I think in the beginning years, it should all be cash
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.560]   because it keeps it very simple.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.520]   So my children have a spending bag.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.800]   I use little money bags.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.380]   And I have a big collection of them.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.320]   They're all color-coded for each child.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.080]   And so you have your giving bag,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.040]   your saving bag, and your spending bag.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:11.100]   When I started this plan, I was overly complicated,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.600]   as is what, excuse me, as is my wont.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.680]   And so I had a careful ledger of every dollar made
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.000]   in the investment return, et cetera, and that was too much.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.220]   And so I don't think that there needs
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.600]   to be careful records kept on it in the beginning.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.120]   But there should be then a transition
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.600]   over to careful record-keeping.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.080]   And I think that cash has far more advantages
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.700]   than disadvantages.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.700]   We're much too quick to search for an electronic solution
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.840]   to a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.320]   And the vast majority of us, if we ran our lives
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.480]   quite literally with physical currency,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   we would all be richer and better off,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.160]   even at our advanced, sophisticated stage of life.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.720]   Now, I don't run my life entirely on physical currency.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.680]   So I understand that there is important value
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.660]   in these other forms of money management.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:15.660]   But they're all inferior to physical currency,
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.720]   especially for young people.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.480]   Most of us have no basic concept
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.300]   of what digits feel like to spend.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.520]   And our children definitely don't have it.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   And so if you and I, I routinely encourage people
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.140]   to use physical currency, and forgive the slightly roundabout,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.080]   and it's important to make the point
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.600]   as to why I'm making the recommendation I am.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.040]   I routinely encourage people to use physical currency
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.600]   because you feel what physical currency feels like.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.740]   So let's say you're at an adult stage of life,
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.680]   and it's very normal for you to spend hundreds of dollars
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.120]   and thousands of dollars.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.260]   It wouldn't be unusual for you
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.280]   to spend $1,000 on a weekend, right?
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   You'll have a $700 Costco trip, and $150 dinner out,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.120]   and I don't know, $100 gas bill, right?
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.100]   That would be a very reasonable weekend for most of us.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:16.380]   If you make all those purchases with a card,
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.860]   and I ask you to estimate how much money you spent,
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.680]   let's say it's Tuesday,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.320]   or even at the end of your Saturday or on Sunday,
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.380]   then you won't have much of a sense
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.180]   of exactly how much money you spent.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.700]   It's too hard to keep track of.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.220]   Our brains do not track digits.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.500]   But if you routinely take out $1,000 or $2,000
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.900]   and $100 bills and you put them in your wallet,
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.980]   every bill has a feeling to you.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.400]   And so if you know you've spent about half the stack,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.340]   every time you hand over the seven $100 bills at Costco,
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.980]   you feel about what that's like,
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.660]   because five bills feels different from seven bills
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.540]   feels different from 10 bills.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.920]   And so it's much easier to track.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.320]   Now that's, you're in my situation
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.120]   after years of managing money,
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.620]   and most of us who are older,
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.620]   years of managing money in a non-digital context.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.500]   So then we just assume that we have to train our children
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.980]   to manage digital money.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.220]   And so the answer to that is give them a debit card.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.700]   But they have the same problem.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.380]   They don't have a feeling of what that feels like.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.940]   And so I think it's perfectly reasonable
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.420]   to do all money management with currency
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.300]   until you get into the teenage years.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.660]   And then you need to bring in additional skills.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.880]   So then I think the idea should be,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.880]   we should probably have multiple accounts.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.680]   So I have not gotten to this stage yet.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.040]   I've tested a few solutions.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.760]   There are some financial,
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.940]   there are some financial companies
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.720]   that have products for this.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.080]   I'm a big fan of Revolut.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.300]   I think they've got a decent system for this.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.600]   But I think it really can be, any bank can do it.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.760]   But in essence, I think that we should
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.240]   simply teach our children to have multiple accounts.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.840]   So we take the physical account structure
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.680]   that I have described,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.560]   and we transfer the physical account structure
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.640]   into a bank account structure.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.480]   So you should have three accounts.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.420]   You should have a giving account,
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.760]   you should have a spending account,
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.980]   and you should have an investing account.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.880]   And anytime you spend money,
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.480]   it should all be out of the spending account.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.160]   Anytime you give money, you give out of the giving account.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.880]   And then obviously investing, that never gets spent.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.960]   It only gets invested, profits go back in,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.640]   profits get split, et cetera.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.840]   And so I think choosing some kind of debit card system
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.600]   that will work for you and give you
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.160]   that product for your child to split money into,
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.840]   I think is what you're looking for.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.460]   Again, a lot of the,
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.200]   I wish I hadn't created a list of all the things.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.400]   I'm sure most banks are looking for options.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.820]   I'm a fan of Revolut, like I said,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.700]   because it allows people to have a prepaid debit card
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.300]   that doesn't have, you don't overdraft,
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.680]   you don't incur fees, et cetera.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.040]   You just look in the account, is there money there?
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.680]   I can spend it, if there's not, I don't.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   And that works really well.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.040]   And by the way, to be clear,
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.640]   generally the child only needs one debit card
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.940]   for her spending account, that's it.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.120]   And she needs some way to keep track of it.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.000]   And so if it's attached to a phone app,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.620]   if she has a phone, that's an ideal thing as well.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.160]   This is where I see enormous value
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.560]   in teaching all the old skills
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   of checkbook balancing, et cetera.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.940]   I think it's really great to have those records, et cetera,
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.460]   but I also acknowledge the fact that nobody does it.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.340]   And so those are some of those skills
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.180]   that are probably gonna go by the wayside.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.020]   But that's my answer, is three different accounts,
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.860]   one with a debit card for spending,
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.480]   making sure that there's an easy way to check the balance,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.980]   to see if there's money in the account, things like that.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.380]   - That sounds great.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.020]   I really, really appreciate it.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.020]   - My pleasure.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.980]   All right, we move on to Garth was next.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.220]   Garth in Minnesota, welcome to the show.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.520]   How can I serve you today?
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.620]   - Hey, Joshua, my wife and I are in our mid forties.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.080]   We have two kids that are in their tween years.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.680]   And in the past few years, our income,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.520]   our net worth have ramped up quite a bit.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.000]   Careers have grown and it's unlocking more options,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.280]   I think, than we would have anticipated
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.400]   maybe five, 10 years ago.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.560]   And as our kids are getting a little older,
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.720]   I'm starting to think more and more
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.140]   about like the next stages of life.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.100]   And my wife has always preferred
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.720]   to be a little bit more spontaneous.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.080]   We've been really focused on, we both work full time,
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.440]   focusing on raising our children and thinking and planning
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.120]   in terms of the coming months
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.000]   and what needs to get done today.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.600]   And maybe it's a midlife thing,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   but as my perspective is changing,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.320]   and I'm trying to think more longer term
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.120]   about money, career, and us building
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.060]   the next stage of our life together.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.560]   And again, I think she's really kind of,
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.080]   you know, she thinks in terms of more of that spontaneous,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.600]   which provides a nice balance in our relationship.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.880]   But I'd love to get kind of your perspective on that, right?
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.080]   I'd love to be able to unlock that power
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.600]   of long-term goal setting and move in a direction together,
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.360]   but I don't know.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.800]   Hopefully that's enough to riff on for you.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.840]   - I think what you're, so it sounds like,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.120]   at first I thought you were going to kind of,
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.320]   how does this relate to children?
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.720]   But that's not the question you're asking.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.920]   You're primarily saying, you know,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.400]   how do we build a vision for our life in the coming decades,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.040]   given that we're likely to be wealthier
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.940]   than we ever imagined, is that right?
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.000]   - Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.840]   - Okay.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.240]   As you stated, it's a wide question,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.400]   but I'll give you my best shot.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.560]   First, it's perfectly fine to focus
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.520]   on short and medium-term goals.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.160]   And there is, you are in a stage of life
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.120]   that is only going to be here for a short period of time.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.840]   And if you need to set aside the long-term goal planning
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.880]   to really focus on this stage,
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.960]   I think that is perfectly reasonable and appropriate.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.840]   I think a lot about time-bound goals
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.960]   versus money-bound goals.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   And right now you have some very intensely time-bound goals.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:31.840]   You have two twin children that are with you,
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:37.040]   and most of your experiences of long-term of life,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.000]   most of the positive experiences
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.960]   that you're looking forward to in your life,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.920]   and most of the negative experiences
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.960]   that could destroy your life,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.760]   will be dependent upon the success of your children
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.040]   and your relationship,
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.800]   the quality of your relationship with your children.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.000]   When I say success, let me define the context
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.680]   I'm saying that.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   If you have a child who becomes a drug addict
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.440]   and bears you a grandchild while a drug addict,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.320]   and now you have to raise your grandchild
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.640]   while your daughter is off in the streets
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.360]   or your son is off shooting up people in the hood
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.960]   or something like that,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.520]   the coming decades of your life
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.160]   are going to be extraordinarily painful.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.280]   On the other hand, if your children do well in school,
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.560]   they have a good sense of who they are,
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.200]   they know what they like, what they don't like,
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.760]   they have a good sense of kind of the kinds of lifestyles
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.400]   that would be a good fit for them.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.140]   If they proceed smoothly through the stages of life,
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.300]   they become competent and mature adults,
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:54.300]   they attract a high quality husband or a high quality wife,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.600]   they get married, they have children,
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.280]   they have a satisfying life
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.160]   full of rich family relationships, et cetera,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.120]   and they live stable, productive lives,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.840]   then you can look forward to enormous amounts of pleasure
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.960]   for the coming decades.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.920]   Pleasure in watching your children thrive and succeed,
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.520]   watching them experience all of the joys of young adulthood
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.920]   and passing through the stages,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.480]   watching them bear grandchildren,
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.400]   raise grandchildren, et cetera,
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.760]   that's gonna be an enormous source of pleasure,
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.240]   and you will wind up like many grandparents
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.360]   moving across the country,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.560]   so you can be close to your grandchildren, et cetera.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.640]   And so to the extent that there's anything
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   that you could do to determine the pathway of your children,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.520]   whether they were on the pathway of success
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.560]   or the pathway of failure as human beings,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.240]   that, then you should do those things.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:57.000]   And yet, there's a very, a relatively narrow window
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   in which you can do those things,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   because you are launching your children into independence
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.520]   over, let's say, the next five to seven years,
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.760]   depending on the specific ages
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.240]   and each individual child's process of maturity.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.400]   So for you to be intensely focused on this
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.240]   over the course of these five years
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.260]   is a perfectly adequate thing to focus on,
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.920]   because that's what's gonna set the course
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.200]   for the next 50 years of your life.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.880]   And so if 80% of your attention is on that
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.240]   and 20% is on the 50-year vision,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.000]   then that's not wrong as a result.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.840]   Now, what will happen is that as your children
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.280]   move from tweens to upper high school students
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.080]   and ultimately college students,
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.840]   you'll have naturally a lot more time available to you
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.560]   to think about those 50-year goals,
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.640]   just due to the natural process of independence.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.200]   But don't think that it's more important
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.280]   to focus on the 50-year goals.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.760]   To the neglect of your work right now, it's not.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.020]   It's your work right now that's gonna make a big difference.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:14.440]   Now, what is an enormous danger to be guarded against
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.720]   of where you are right now?
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.560]   Well, I think a danger is that your identity
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   as husband and wife doesn't exist.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.440]   Instead, your identity is father and mother.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.360]   And so then if we think forward to a period of time,
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.120]   just a few short years from now, when you're empty nesters,
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.680]   if you wake up and you don't know your wife
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.440]   and you don't know anything about her goals
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.520]   and dreams for the future
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.200]   and her ambition for the future, et cetera,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.300]   then you're doomed.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.960]   And there's divorce court,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.480]   you know, in some worst-case scenarios, waiting for you.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.680]   And it's not necessary.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.360]   So you do need to give attention
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.880]   to those long-term goals and dreams.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.160]   But I just wanna, I'm just acknowledging
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.240]   that it may be a modest amount of attention.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.360]   What I would say is the most important thing
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.240]   is for you and your wife to spend time together
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.360]   as husband and wife and to really make a priority of it.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.800]   So having tweens is different
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.840]   than having very young children.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.540]   You know, I just took my wife away
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.940]   for a short getaway for Valentine's Day.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.400]   And, you know, when we're in baby mode as we are right now,
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.720]   we still have a baby with us,
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.060]   but I've gotta find multiple families
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.800]   to have multiple people who can take all the children
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.320]   'cause there's tons of children and they're all young.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.480]   And so it's a lot of work.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.960]   As you pass into the teenage years,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.400]   it's relatively easy for you and your wife to get away.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.080]   And so get away, get away for a weekend every quarter
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.560]   and just the two of you.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.520]   And just talk about and think about what is in the future.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.240]   And you need to make certain
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.840]   that you really understand her and her ambitions
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.240]   and what she's going to,
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.120]   what are the kinds of things
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.680]   that she wants more of in her life.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.360]   The fact that she is more serendipitous in nature
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.120]   and more willing to accept what comes
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.320]   doesn't absolve you of your responsibility to plan
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.480]   for her to have all the things that she's serendipitous,
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.600]   gonna be serendipitously happy about.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.680]   And so in some ways, what you're describing
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.520]   is a function of my own relationship with my wife.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.360]   I'm the long-term thinker.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.360]   Here's the plan.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.080]   Here's the, okay, with this decade,
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.280]   it's gonna be this strategy.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.200]   The following decade is gonna be these things.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.040]   Here's what we're gonna do.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.460]   Here's what we're gonna do, et cetera.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.160]   But I still need to make sure that I know her
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.960]   because the fact that her way of planning
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.120]   is different than mine
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.200]   and her way of envisioning the future is different than mine
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.080]   doesn't make it more or less valid.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.400]   And so I have to get out of her vision
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.720]   and I have to make certain
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.160]   that our family plan accounts for that.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.680]   It counts for her to achieve those things.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.440]   And that just comes with knowing your wife
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.080]   in an intimate way.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.420]   And then talking to her in a context
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:02.420]   that is going to suss out what she's into.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.840]   And so here's where I think
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.760]   some good goal-setting questions are important.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.720]   And then just taking them and doing this as a couple.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.160]   You go to a nice resort once a quarter,
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.080]   once every six months or whatever, get away.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.920]   And don't pack your schedule full of activities,
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.400]   but spend some time talking about it
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.280]   and make the lists, right?
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.440]   Here are 30 things I wanna do, 30 things I wanna be,
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.120]   30 things I wanna have before I die.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.680]   Go through, envision,
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.440]   okay, if we could do anything in the world,
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   what would it look like?
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.080]   What would we do if we knew
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.520]   there was no possibility of failure?
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.040]   All the many dozens of great goal-setting questions
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.720]   and visioning exercises.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.800]   Do those exercises and look for the themes
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.080]   and then start to schedule those things in intentionally.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:47.820]   And recognize that your lives will be very different
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.020]   as you launch your children than they are now.
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:54.440]   And anything out more?
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.480]   I mean, I guess that's a starting point.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.540]   Is that directionally helpful in any way?
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.000]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.280]   And I logged you a non-specific question
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.120]   and I think you hit on all the key points
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.800]   I was hoping you would riff on.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.400]   And I guess more than anything,
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.280]   it's a function of, hey,
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.440]   if we're following the 80/20 framework
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.720]   that you looked at and making sure that
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.820]   we're focused on that,
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.940]   that's, I think, some really sage advice
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.260]   and probably what I needed to hear on the call today.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.300]   So thank you, Joshua.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.140]   - My pleasure.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:27.660]   It does really matter and you won't regret.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.580]   If you spend more money now with your tweens,
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.980]   if you build more intimacy of relationship with them,
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.780]   et cetera, I think that,
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.660]   and by the way, you don't have to spend money,
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.700]   but my point is that if you're thinking about,
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.180]   well, should we get richer ourselves
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.540]   or should we really do this dream thing
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.780]   that we've wanted to do with our children?
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.500]   Take six months off and backpack Europe or whatever.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.940]   You are in a very precious period of time
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.820]   where in terms of investing into relationship,
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.820]   there's going to be,
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.140]   there's just a very narrow window
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.820]   where your children are old enough
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.340]   to basically interact with you as adults,
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.080]   but they are not yet transitioning to full independence
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.780]   to where they are legal adults and et cetera.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.580]   And I think that's a really satisfying phase of life
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.580]   where you can have enormous amounts of input
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.740]   into your children's lives,
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:24.740]   and also, but yet interact with them as adults.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:30.300]   'Cause when you've got a 20 year old who's telling you,
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.260]   your daughter's telling you what she's thinking about,
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.940]   et cetera, you're not gonna be interfering in her life.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.700]   You're not gonna be directing her life
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.620]   like you do when she's 13.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.460]   You're gonna be listening.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.820]   You're gonna be coaching.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.780]   You're gonna be asking good questions,
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.180]   but you're not gonna be telling her what to do.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.900]   She's 20 years old.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.020]   But when she's 13, you're spending,
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.780]   you're able to direct her in a better way.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.300]   And so anything you can do to really engage in relationship
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.860]   and help your children at this stage
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.860]   should be the 80% of your activities.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.820]   I guess there's just one more thing.
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.200]   I really think that,
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.860]   I'm blanking on the name of the book.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.580]   I think if you haven't read it,
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:15.820]   you should read Gabor Mate's book on,
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.380]   find the title here real quick,
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.380]   called "Hold On To Your Kids".
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.940]   I think that's a really valuable book,
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.820]   a really valuable parenting book.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.980]   And basically, my two sentence summary of it
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.580]   is that you should be very intentional
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.860]   about keeping your children connected to you as a father
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.980]   and to your wife as a mother,
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:45.660]   rather than forcing your children onto their peers
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.260]   as a primary source of direction in the culture.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.420]   And Mate makes the point in that book
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:58.420]   about the novelty that is modern youth culture.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.780]   And I realize this is a big blind spot for me as a parent,
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.660]   is that I've always believed that we should help children
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.820]   to develop independence at an early age.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.340]   It's my basic belief that we should,
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.420]   kind of like they used to do,
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.220]   our vision should be that by 13 or 14 or 15,
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.740]   that our children are fully independent adults.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.940]   Now, obviously, they're not gonna be
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.100]   fully independent adults,
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.540]   but you're dealing with an adult at that point in time
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.700]   that in all historical cultures
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.000]   has been considered an adult.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.820]   So we shouldn't aim for 18,
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.100]   we should aim for 13 as the age at which to produce adults.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.300]   With various modifications of that
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.420]   due to the reality of the fact
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.900]   that they're not legal adults,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.300]   and that we're not trying to force them into a path,
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.860]   you don't want your 13 year old getting married,
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:51.500]   but your ambition is not to extend childhood.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.260]   However, what I realized when I read Mate's book
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:59.260]   was that it's very easy to,
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.620]   if you have a mindset of independence,
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.980]   it's very easy to force your children
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.140]   to go out into their peer culture
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.380]   and to attach to their peer culture
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.020]   instead of being attached to their family
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.300]   and in their community.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.700]   And we don't want that because the peer culture is toxic.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:17.100]   What we want is them to have great
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.260]   and fulfilling relationships with peers,
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:23.700]   but not to look to their peers for wisdom and for direction,
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.140]   but we want them to be very consciously attached
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:29.780]   to us as parents, to our community that we're in
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.860]   across the generations.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.420]   And so check that out and think about
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.740]   how you can apply anything
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.820]   that is relevant from that as well.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.340]   All right, we go to the great state of Ontario.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.420]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.900]   - Oh, Joshua, thank you so much
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.220]   for those last couple of answers, they were excellent.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.980]   - My pleasure, thank you very much.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:54.540]   - So my basic question is to do with
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:57.220]   real estate versus Bitcoin.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.060]   So I'll give you a quick background.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.340]   I have some real estate properties
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.180]   I purchased about 20 years ago
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.460]   in a fairly depressed market,
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.540]   which sat quite still for about 15 years.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.100]   And then approximately five years ago,
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.300]   things turned around here as they did in so many places.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:15.100]   We're about four times our purchase price now.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.580]   And basically they've cashflowed all the way along,
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.100]   they're still doing fine.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.860]   However, I'm thinking in terms of the,
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.900]   sort of that four X that happened,
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.700]   that is unlikely to happen again at that class.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.180]   So I'm just trying to consider if I should
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.980]   divest myself of some portion of the properties
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:37.700]   and consider other asset classes.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.020]   To give some context, I'm not like new to Bitcoin,
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:46.020]   I would say about 18% of my net worth is there.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:51.100]   And so I've been investing in that since about 2017.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.420]   So I've weathered the highs and lows of it
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.940]   and I'm not afraid of it,
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.660]   but I just, you've always given great advice
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.860]   in these kinds of scenarios, so I thought I'd ask.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:05.060]   - Yeah, so let's break the decision apart.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.340]   I'm not gonna give you,
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.580]   and obviously I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.380]   - I'm not looking for your specific advice on them,
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.740]   but yeah, how to think about that.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.820]   - But we can break it apart
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.620]   and we can kind of make good strategic decision-making,
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.700]   I think, if we break it apart.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.420]   So first, recognize that the decision
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.860]   that you have in front of you
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.860]   is not either Ontario real estate or Bitcoin.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.460]   And forgive me, the next caller is from Oregon
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.900]   and I misread on my screen, Ontario versus Oregon,
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.060]   ON versus OR, but we're talking about Ontario here.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.900]   So the decision is not Ontario Canada real estate
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:42.580]   or Bitcoin, but there are a variety
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.220]   of other options available.
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.940]   So the first decision is,
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:49.300]   should I sell my Ontario real estate
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.300]   that has been good to me, I made a lot of money,
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.220]   or should I not sell my Ontario real estate
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.980]   that has made a good amount of money?
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.900]   So let's start with that.
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.060]   Let me just simplify it to that.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.660]   If you were starting over today with the amount of,
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.620]   and are we talking half a million dollars,
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.300]   a million dollars, basically just big picture,
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   how much money are we talking about
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.540]   that you're considering making a change with?
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.540]   - It could be, yeah, we'll go with half of it.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.300]   - Okay, so if you had a half a million dollars of cash
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.700]   sitting in the bank account,
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.020]   would you purchase Ontario real estate today
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.220]   on February 16, 2024?
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.100]   - No.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.780]   - Okay, so then the answer is you should sell it.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.740]   Because even if you just took the money
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.180]   and you put it in the bank,
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.020]   you wouldn't purchase it again, so you should sell it.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.460]   That was a very different decision
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.180]   than previous when you bought it,
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:42.780]   and you've had a forex return, et cetera.
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.820]   So you should sell the real estate
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.460]   and you should get out of it
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.740]   for I think the reasons that were obvious
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:51.860]   in the quickness of your answer.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.420]   And I would generally affirm that.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.540]   It seems that to me that real estate in Canada
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.180]   doesn't have, I don't wanna get,
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.140]   I'm not out trying to buy real estate in Canada
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.340]   with what I see today.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.380]   But you know the market and you were confident in that.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.740]   So you should sell the real estate in Canada.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.020]   Now, what should you do with the money?
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.500]   Well, I don't know.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.940]   And if you don't know, then that is a perfectly,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.060]   it's perfectly reasonable just to put the money in the bank
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.620]   and sit tight and wait until you do know.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.540]   But one option that you have
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.380]   is to put the money into Bitcoin
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.620]   or put some money into Bitcoin.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:35.980]   So now tell me why you would buy Bitcoin
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.340]   and what you would hope that Bitcoin
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.380]   can do for you in your life.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.980]   - All right.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.140]   I can resell it, I like that.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:52.140]   So it's interesting because I first started selling
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.980]   I first started thinking about this with Bitcoin
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.940]   at a significantly lower value than it is today.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:03.820]   So I have become overwhelmingly convinced
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:10.980]   that it's not going to zero.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:14.380]   It's not going to zero
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.540]   and the money continues to flow into it.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:20.380]   And I only see one direction it can go.
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.300]   So it seems to me like it is,
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.860]   I believe it to be currently undervalued.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:33.100]   And I am enjoying all the purchases I've ever made of it,
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:43.660]   including ones that I'm currently in the red on.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.700]   It's not like they've increased my personal security
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.540]   and happiness.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:56.540]   - Okay.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.140]   All right.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:03.660]   So it sounds to me then like you should buy some Bitcoin.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:08.180]   So how much Bitcoin do you think you should buy?
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.180]   How much do you want to own and why?
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:16.380]   - I don't have that answer.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.540]   I don't know.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.660]   - And that's the hardest question, right?
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:24.180]   Because you could have conviction
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.460]   about an investment thesis.
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.540]   In your case, you believe that this is an asset class.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:30.580]   It's not going to zero.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.660]   It probably has good room to run
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.740]   and from your perspective.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.300]   So you have the idea that I want to go after this
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.260]   with some of my money,
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.100]   but how do we figure out how to do it?
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.740]   And that's the hardest question.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:47.020]   So what I would say is the framework
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.020]   without getting into all the personal details
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.500]   of your affairs is to think about
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.420]   what would happen if there were big wins
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.780]   and what would happen if there were big losses.
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.180]   So there are two basic models
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.180]   that I think can make a lot of sense.
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.260]   First of all, is you can just simply have
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:08.140]   a simple, strong asset allocation model.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.460]   And the model doesn't have to be something
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.780]   that you necessarily have to defend to someone else.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.540]   It just needs to be something that makes sense to you.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.140]   So here would be an example of something
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.260]   that I think would make sense
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.300]   in terms of somebody who had that perspective,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.740]   two examples.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.220]   So the first example would be somebody who says,
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:32.020]   you know what, this is very common in personal finance.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.060]   This would be the most, of all the things I'm going to say,
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.820]   this is the most conventional
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.020]   where you're sitting down with most financial advisors.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.340]   They wouldn't say you're stupid if you said this.
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.700]   So if you said, you know what?
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.980]   I'm going to, with my investment capital,
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.620]   I'm not going to include my personal residence or et cetera,
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.300]   but with my investment capital,
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.980]   I'm going to keep 80% of my investment capital
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.740]   into mutual funds.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.620]   I'm going to take 20% of my capital
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.500]   and not put it in mutual funds.
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:03.500]   Of that 20%, I'm going to put 5% in physical gold
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:08.020]   and I'm going to put 5% in Bitcoin
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.300]   and as insurance policies against crazy stuff happening
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.100]   with the bulk of my investment account
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:18.620]   and I'm going to keep 10% for my stock trading account
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.820]   where I'm going to trade stocks and derivatives.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.260]   So that would be, nobody would argue with that.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.380]   They would say, okay, well, you know,
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.420]   you've got 80% of your money in good, safe mutual funds
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.300]   and stocks, et cetera.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.220]   We know that those have a pretty decent history.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.780]   We think that they'll probably be okay in the future
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.140]   and you've got 5% investment funds.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.060]   That would be a reasonable thing.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.380]   Now, this would not be normal,
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.180]   but this would also be still in the realm
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.980]   of kind of not crazy thinking.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.260]   Would be, if you said something like, you know what?
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.460]   I don't know what's going to happen
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.780]   and so I just want to own all the asset classes.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.740]   So I'm going to put 20% of my money in stocks.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.380]   I'm going to put 20% of my money in gold.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:01.100]   I'm going to put 20% of my money into Bitcoin.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.740]   I'm going to put 20% of my money in real estate
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.060]   and I'm going to put 20% of my money in long-term bonds.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.140]   And that would be a model that is kind of interesting
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.340]   is that we've got quite a lot of exposure
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.820]   to different asset classes.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.980]   We could backtest that.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.220]   It's kind of interesting when you do it,
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.780]   but it's still kind of a spread it around type of scenario.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.300]   So you could come up with some version of that
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.220]   that's going to feel good to you.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.700]   And it's probably more,
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.060]   what I'm guessing would be your number
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.580]   would be more than 1% and less than 90%
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.460]   in terms of the amount of money
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.220]   that you're going to invest in Bitcoin.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.860]   And you don't have to have a great logical argument
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.180]   for this necessarily.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.460]   If you just instinctively know that my number is 20%
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.620]   or 10% or 5% and that's the amount of money
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.020]   I want to have in this asset class,
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.100]   that's a reasonable way to go about it.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.420]   Even if you can't justify it,
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.300]   that kind of initial reaction that you have
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.340]   to me throwing out some numbers, pay attention to that.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.060]   The second thing would be to analyze it
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.780]   based upon kind of potential.
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.100]   And so the best I've come up with,
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.780]   if we're speculating on something,
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:11.380]   then my rules of speculation are these.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:15.420]   Your speculation needs to be big enough to make a difference
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.380]   if it wins big and small enough not to wipe you out
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.500]   if it completely loses.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.300]   So let's put a little texture on this.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:28.860]   What do you think is the absolute maximum thing
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.620]   that could happen to the value of Bitcoin?
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.580]   - I don't, I mean, it depends on the timeline.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.580]   I mean, if it's 10 years, then I don't see it, yeah.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.540]   It's a lot.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.660]   - Okay, so as--
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.140]   - Too many people try to put a number on it
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.500]   and they're so wildly divergent.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.700]   - All right, so let's just make some things up.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.100]   So as we talk today, Bitcoin is trading
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.620]   for something like 50,
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.940]   just a little less than 52,000 US dollar tokens
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:10.500]   to each Bitcoin token in the current market, okay?
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.700]   So let's say that the value of Bitcoin tokens
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.900]   compared to US dollar tokens,
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.860]   let's say that the ratio between those doubled.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:25.580]   And then you were trading with Bitcoin
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.180]   at 100,000 US dollar tokens as compared to today, right?
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.620]   That'd be pretty amazing investment performance, right?
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.700]   - Yeah. - All right.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.540]   Let's say that it quadrupled
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.980]   and we were talking about 400,000 US dollar tokens
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.820]   for every one Bitcoin token.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.900]   So that would be amazing, right, amazing.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.100]   And a lot harder to see how it quadruples
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:52.100]   than where we went from a dollar to whatever, 40,000.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.900]   But it would be amazing if it 4X'd.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.820]   So you just figure out whatever you think
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.260]   is the most optimistic thing that could happen.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.860]   Now let's assume that you invested 50,000 US dollars
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.820]   into Bitcoin at today's prices.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.300]   And then it quadrupled in value
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:17.300]   from 50,000 US dollars to 200,000 US dollars.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.180]   Would that make any meaningful difference
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.420]   in your financial life?
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:25.540]   - I mean, yes, it would.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.660]   But at the same time, it would just sit there
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.500]   because outside of that,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.100]   there's still lots of liquidity available.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.980]   So it would just, I guess, be a number.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.900]   - Right, I think it would probably be largely a number
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.700]   because there's, from what you described,
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.620]   if you got half a million dollars of real estate,
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.220]   I don't think having an extra $200,000 sitting here
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.140]   and not sitting here is gonna make much of a difference
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.060]   in your case.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.300]   Now, I made up the numbers,
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.060]   so you feel free to judge for yourself.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.780]   But you wouldn't quit working today
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.700]   because now you're independent for the rest of your life.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.660]   It would just be a little bit more money
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.780]   than what you have right now.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.820]   But now on the flip side,
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.860]   let's say that your $50,000 that you invested today
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.220]   went to zero.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:09.560]   Would that make any meaningful difference in your life?
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:14.900]   - I mean, it wouldn't be any fun,
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.060]   but no, it would not end anything.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.540]   - Right, and so you see the point that I'm driving at
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:24.740]   is that if you really believe in the Bitcoin thesis,
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.180]   the idea that Bitcoin is gonna increase in value,
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.220]   and you wanna speculate on that,
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.380]   then you need to speculate with enough money
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:36.820]   so that whatever your biggest winning opportunity is
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.460]   that you believe could happen,
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:42.140]   that that would make a meaningful difference in your life.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.360]   But you don't wanna speculate with so much money
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.060]   that whatever you think is the worst case scenario
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.720]   would wipe you out.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.660]   That's the idea that I'm driving at.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.340]   And so if you think about those two extremes,
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.780]   there's probably some amount,
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.140]   and those numbers will vary based upon
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.260]   where you are in life.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.660]   And so let's use,
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.540]   I have a lot of Bitcoin millionaires in my audience.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.720]   Here's what has happened with many of them.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.900]   Many of them saw the Bitcoin thesis early on,
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.640]   and they believed in it.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.820]   They were often young,
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.260]   and they often didn't have a lot of money,
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.620]   but they took everything that they had,
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.300]   and they put it into Bitcoin.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.580]   And so there are lots of people out there
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.980]   who are working a job as a waiter
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.140]   and putting every dollar they earned,
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.860]   sleeping on an air mattress in a friend's living room,
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.140]   putting every dollar they earned into Bitcoin
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.080]   because they really believed in it.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.060]   So that kind of speculation
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.580]   for somebody who's, say, 23 years old,
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.860]   for a 23-year-old who's gained $50,000 of life savings
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   to put all of it into Bitcoin and every dollar beside,
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.540]   for that 23-year-old to get wiped out,
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.100]   that's not that big of a deal
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:56.060]   because there's not a big crash in lifestyle
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.620]   that if things get wiped out,
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.780]   okay, I get another job and I start again.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.780]   And so that guy could put 100% of his money into Bitcoin
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.940]   because he really believed in the long-term outcome,
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:12.740]   and he, yeah, losing his life savings was no fun,
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:15.180]   but he was depending on his job primarily
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.660]   as a pathway through that.
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.720]   After all, there's lots of 23-year-olds
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.860]   who don't have any money,
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.780]   and they just depend upon their job.
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.460]   Now, compare that with, you know,
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.900]   I've got a client of mine who's a physician,
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.700]   and he sold his practice.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.300]   And I forget the exact number,
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.020]   but it was a 10-figure payday after taxes,
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.940]   a 10-figure payout after taxes.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.300]   He's in his early 40s,
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:41.900]   and he's still making money as a physician, et cetera,
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.540]   but he basically was set up for the rest of his life
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.820]   based upon his lifestyle if he wanted to be.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.820]   So imagine you're in your early 40s,
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.620]   or it's actually, yeah, maybe younger,
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.140]   anyway, about 40 or so,
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.500]   and you've got a 10-figure payday after taxes.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.100]   Do you really wanna take your 10-figure payday
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.260]   and put it all in Bitcoin
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.340]   because Bitcoin's going to the moon?
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.380]   That would be an enormous price tag if Bitcoin disappeared.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:13.380]   And so you would be much more thoughtful about how much,
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:18.380]   and you might actually wager significant amounts of money
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:22.060]   on your bet, you might invest seven figures,
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:25.460]   but you need to make certain your goal is not,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.500]   there's not gonna be a big difference in your life
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.420]   between a $12 million net worth
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.980]   and a $30 million net worth.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.280]   There's not that much there.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.040]   There could be a difference between 12 million
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.820]   and 120 million, sure, okay, fine,
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.200]   but the difference of you going
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   from a $12 million lifestyle to a $2 million lifestyle,
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.900]   because you risked it all on Bitcoin,
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.660]   that's enormously costly.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.940]   So my point is you're basically playing a game
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.980]   with your speculation of best case scenario,
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.580]   worst case scenario, where I'm at in life,
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:01.700]   cost of a loss, time that I have to make up for it,
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.460]   how much income do I have, what percentage of my net worth,
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.080]   and that's a very personalized game
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.300]   that I couldn't answer for you,
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.540]   but I think that's a decent model to begin with
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.380]   to figure out how much money you're gonna speculate with.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:17.420]   - That framework is exactly the type of answer
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.260]   I was looking for from you
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.300]   just to help think this through better.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.140]   I appreciate that.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.340]   And also, the last couple of answers on parenting,
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.100]   always appreciated your parenting,
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.340]   your podcast that was Radical Fatherhood,
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:33.860]   Radical something, anyway, that was very helpful to me.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.260]   We've got a bunch of kids
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:39.940]   that have appreciated your advice on that over the years.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.420]   - Good, thank you so much. - Thank you.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.620]   - My pleasure, my pleasure.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:43.780]   All right, we move on.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.180]   Now we go to Oregon.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.300]   Oregon, you're gonna wrap us up today.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.420]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.860]   - Hey there, I just wanted to say
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:54.540]   I really wish I could come to your family camp,
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.820]   so I'm a little irritated I can't go.
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.420]   I hope you do it some other year, first of all.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.460]   Sounds a lot of fun.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.300]   - Absolutely.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.900]   - Yeah, and then two questions.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.580]   First one's really short, is you had an episode
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.040]   where you kind of did some self-talk.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.220]   You told us your kind of rhythm in the morning
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.540]   where we talked to yourself.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.200]   So I was wondering if you still do that, one,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.380]   and if you could tell me which episode that is
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.700]   'cause I have looked and looked and cannot find it.
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.140]   (laughing)
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:21.980]   - Sure, sure.
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.420]   So by the way, for the uninitiated,
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.700]   I meant to do an ad for this earlier,
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.900]   but I am hosting in April, the middle of April,
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.820]   just the weekend before Tax Day,
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.380]   am hosting Radical Family Camp in Indiana.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.620]   You can find details at RadicalFamilyCamp.com
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.100]   and at the end of the episode I'll say more about that.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.140]   The initial sale tickets are more than half sold out now,
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.340]   so RadicalFamilyCamp.com if you're interested
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.640]   in coming and spending a weekend with me
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.960]   and other listeners.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.340]   So the self-talk, I learned that years ago
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.860]   primarily from Zig Ziglar.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:57.900]   In the early days of podcasting,
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.100]   one of the first podcasts I was,
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.260]   Apple Podcasts had almost nothing
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:07.180]   and I was working a job where I could listen to stuff
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.920]   while I was working and I didn't have much to listen to.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.020]   This was, I guess when I was, I don't remember.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.060]   It was in college, early years of college.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.060]   And so I would load up iTunes
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.380]   and I was looking for podcasts.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.460]   And at the time, Zig Ziglar's company
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.340]   had his stuff going out as podcasts.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.140]   I listened to all his podcast episodes.
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.580]   Then I started listening to the,
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:30.900]   then I started listening to the,
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.420]   I bought his, started buying his CDs of his courses.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.700]   You know, I would listen to them driving to work
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.020]   every morning and I just found them
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.420]   to be incredibly insightful and incredibly,
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.700]   incredibly useful.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:47.700]   And what the basic idea behind
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.340]   Ziglar's version of affirmations,
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.900]   which was again, 1980s, '90s kind of stuff
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.460]   where personal development had not gotten
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.140]   as popularly known as today
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.020]   and affirmations were still going,
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.380]   was that he used his affirmations
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.460]   and talked about character qualities.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.340]   And the point that he made that rocked my world
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.060]   as a young man was he pointed out
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.780]   that character qualities are all skills,
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.660]   that they are not innate attributes.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.460]   You're not born honest or born dishonest.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:23.700]   Rather, honesty is something that you exercise
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.180]   and you can become increasingly honest
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.580]   or increasingly dishonest based upon the,
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.300]   based upon the way that you live
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.780]   and the way that you act.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.140]   And things like discipline, you're not,
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.780]   you don't come out of your mother's womb
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.140]   and the doctor holds you up and says,
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.220]   "Hey, here's a disciplined boy."
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:45.140]   You know, it's discipline is something that is developed.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.220]   So if you're a disciplined person
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.300]   or you're focused or you're compassionate
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.500]   or you're respectful or you're kind,
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.740]   you know, kindness is not an innate attribute.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.060]   And that rocked my world.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.780]   It started a process of self-development
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.660]   that continues to this day
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.940]   with even just a lot of my recent interests.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.540]   I've recently been really into "Peak" by Anders Ericsson,
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.580]   his insight into genius.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:11.420]   I read "Talent is Overrated" by Jeff Colvin,
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.580]   his research into kind of synthesizing the field.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.980]   I'm reading "Range" at the moment.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.820]   And basically, these books and this concept
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.580]   for me has been an enormous mindset shift
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.900]   because I grew up thinking
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.140]   that all of these things were innate,
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.380]   that either you had them or you didn't have them.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.180]   I thought that character qualities
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.340]   were either things that you were born with
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.540]   or weren't born with,
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.180]   just like I thought that innate ability and talent
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.300]   and genius was something that you're either born with
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.620]   or you're not born with.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:49.300]   I distinctly remember an experience I had
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.420]   when I was in college, sorry, in high school,
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:55.660]   where I had a friend of mine,
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:56.900]   we were signing up for our classes
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.340]   and choosing our electives,
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.860]   and a friend of mine signed up for an art class.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.700]   And I thought, oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.140]   And I thought, wouldn't that be fun to take an art class?
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.860]   But I can't draw, I'm not artistic.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.380]   And it never dawned on me as a high school student,
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.220]   it never even occurred to me
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:17.980]   that artistic ability is something that can be developed.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.220]   I never imagined that it could be taught.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.140]   I just assumed and thought that you either are an artist
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.420]   or you're not an artist,
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.220]   and you're born an artist with artistic skill or you're not.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.540]   And I knew I didn't have it,
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.180]   so therefore there's no point in taking an art class.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.180]   It sounds stupid when you say it out loud,
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.540]   but I distinctly recall having that experience
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.460]   and thinking, oh, bummer,
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.740]   wouldn't it be neat to be good at art?
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.700]   And I never thought I should sign up for the class.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.020]   And it continues to this day
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.540]   what I've realized is that a lot of us think the same way.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.220]   We think that these things are fixed.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.860]   And all of the research that I can find
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.000]   indicates that all of these things
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.580]   that we think in some cases are innate,
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.180]   they're not in any way innate.
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.780]   They are talent.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.060]   Let me continue on this theme.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.220]   Sorry, they're developed.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.100]   Let me continue for a moment.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:07.940]   I'm gonna come back and tell you
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:09.860]   where to find these affirmations and go over them with you.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.740]   But it's important to understand the basis of them
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.100]   as I see them as being useful.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:20.320]   The most interesting book to me that I read
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.540]   was Anders Erikson's book called "Peak."
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.060]   And in this book, Erikson,
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.420]   who dedicated his entire career
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:32.080]   to studying the genius performers of the world,
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.660]   he came away and wrote this book at the end of his career.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.860]   And as I understand his thesis,
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:41.860]   basically says that all genius level performance
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:45.500]   is attributable to two functions.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:50.500]   Number one is proper training and practice techniques.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.020]   He has developed a term
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.020]   of what he calls deliberate practice,
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.140]   which means something very specific.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:03.000]   It's a type of coached practice
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.660]   in a chosen field or discipline
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:10.060]   that causes you to get better
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   because you're working continually
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.220]   on the things that you're not good at.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.620]   And this could be contrasted
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.040]   with what could be called naive practice.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.140]   The idea is that sometimes people think,
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.100]   well, if I just do something more,
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.540]   if I do something more frequently,
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.540]   then I'll get better at it.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.860]   But this turns out not to be the case,
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.260]   and that's what we call naive practice.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.940]   So a good example would be driving.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.020]   You may drive over the next five years, if you're an adult,
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.060]   you may drive, say, 1,000 hours.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.060]   But at the end of those 1,000 hours,
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.780]   you're unlikely to be in any way
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.260]   a better driver than you are today.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.900]   And in fact, you're probably going to be a worse driver
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.940]   than you are today because there's some amount of entropy
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.500]   that's happening in your skills
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.060]   from when you were more focused.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.260]   And so what they've shown is that in many fields,
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.460]   even fields with experience, for example, medicine,
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.580]   that if you're a physician
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.780]   and you've just been practicing medicine for a long time,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.560]   you're actually not any more likely
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.220]   to give better medical advice
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.960]   than somebody who's been practicing medicine
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.020]   for a very short period of time,
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.960]   unless you have been engaging
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.780]   in very focused personal development and deliberate practice.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.440]   Just doing more of a thing doesn't make you better at it.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.420]   You have to engage in deliberate practice
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.060]   where you are intentionally choosing to get better.
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.140]   Usually this is going to be,
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.300]   you're being coached to get better,
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.000]   or you're coaching yourself to get better.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.340]   You are specifically focusing on specific skills
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:42.080]   that relate to the field that you're trying to improve in.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.060]   So that's number one is deliberate practice.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.300]   Number two is just enough time.
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.100]   And so if you engage in deliberate practice
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.100]   for a sufficient amount of time,
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.620]   that accounts for all world-class performers,
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.040]   for all genius, at least according to Erickson.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.520]   And he has made a personal study
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.420]   of studying all of the child prodigies
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:04.580]   and all of the savants and all the hard cases, et cetera,
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.900]   and that's his conclusion.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.680]   And I find, you know, I don't have any reason to doubt him.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.260]   He's the expert, I'm not.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.620]   And so what's fascinating about that is,
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.780]   I find it a very freeing concept,
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:20.420]   is that I can be a world-class performer
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.100]   in anything that I choose to focus on
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.380]   if I'm willing to engage,
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.500]   if I'm willing and motivated to engage in deliberate practice
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.940]   for a sufficient period of time
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.860]   as is necessary for each field.
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.580]   In some fields, if I didn't begin as a child,
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.940]   I probably will never achieve that genius level.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:42.140]   In other fields, I may be able to,
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.440]   but it comes down to me and what I do.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.460]   And so art is no different, that artistic skills,
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.380]   even artistic art savants and children
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.660]   who just, you know, create beautiful pictures
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.660]   at eight years old and things like that.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:56.300]   They're not born with an art gene.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.020]   There's no evidence of artistic genes.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.580]   It's not innate, it's based upon environment,
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.500]   environmental cues, practice, good coaching,
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.420]   and enough time to develop those skills.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.100]   Even, you know, Mozart, young child prodigies, all included.
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.620]   Even things that are fixed.
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.660]   So for example, Anderson talks about things like IQ.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.340]   IQ is a really fascinating thing
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.860]   because it seems to be broadly heritable and broadly fixed.
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.700]   It doesn't seem to be,
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.380]   it's not like we have a long list of things
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.140]   that dramatically affect IQ.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.260]   There's some things, but it doesn't, dramatic effects.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.900]   But even IQ, that thing that we can measure, sort of,
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.680]   that has some reflection of innate ability,
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.300]   doesn't turn out to be particularly important
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.260]   in the development or expression
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.580]   of genius-level performance in any field of human endeavor.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.460]   Erickson talks about chess players,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.820]   and he indicates that they did a very careful study
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:58.660]   of IQ test performance among chess players.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.020]   And what they found is that IQ seemed to give
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.220]   chess players a slight advantage
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.580]   in the early stages of learning chess.
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.040]   So chess players with a higher measured IQ
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.140]   than other chess players with a lower measured IQ
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.220]   seem to learn and grasp the basic concepts
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.300]   of chess more quickly.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:23.180]   But that difference very quickly disappeared.
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:26.460]   And at the highest level of chess grandmasters,
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:31.460]   chess grandmasters don't show any higher level of IQ
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:35.260]   than is expected based upon the general population.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.100]   And they don't, their performance doesn't seem
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.500]   to be driven by IQ in any way.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.700]   And so really it does come down to practice
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.260]   and development of oneself.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.240]   Now, back to affirmations.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:54.260]   When Ziegler convinced me of the fact that skills,
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.980]   that character qualities are skills,
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:02.980]   then that concept convinced me of the value of affirmations.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:08.100]   Because I've never liked or been in any way comfortable
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.680]   with the woo-woo side of kind of personal development.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.240]   Because the woo-woo side is,
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:20.460]   again, it's just something that,
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.420]   you know, it's like look in the mirror and say I'm rich.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.060]   In reality, I know I'm broke.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.240]   To me, how do you ever do that?
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.380]   You're lying to yourself.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.480]   Start by telling the truth.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.340]   I'd rather just look in the mirror and say I'm broke
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:35.700]   and I don't wanna be than, you know, I'm rich, et cetera.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.700]   But based upon being convinced of those attributes
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:46.580]   being genuine skills, then I realized
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:50.140]   that if I affirm these skills to myself,
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:53.220]   then that may have some valuable effect.
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:56.460]   That may help me to do better
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.740]   and to be able to develop these things.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.340]   And then I can focus on different skills
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:07.060]   at different parts of my day and in my life
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:09.060]   and I can develop them.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.940]   I don't know how to say it any differently than that.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:12.900]   So that was where it was.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.340]   So if you wanna find the affirmation,
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.080]   just search Zig Ziglar Affirmations and you'll find,
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.580]   you can find a PDF of the card
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.380]   that he would send out with his stuff.
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:24.540]   And then what I will do is I will play for you
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:29.100]   the audio here of the morning affirmations that I use.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.900]   And I'll play it for you here.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:33.780]   I think, let's see if this will work while I'm recording.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.120]   Stand by a moment.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:44.780]   All right, so that's not gonna work
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:47.340]   based upon how I have the computer set up for today.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.700]   So I'll just read these to you.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:52.400]   And what I did was I just found some music
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.280]   and recorded them, recorded them.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.500]   But here they are, the text of them.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.980]   And as I say these, I'll read them a little bit slowly,
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.840]   but I just want you to recognize that these things are,
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.620]   these things are, just recognize that these are skills
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.460]   that you can grow in.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:10.620]   So here's how I say them.
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:15.140]   I, Joshua Sheets, am a child of the King,
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:17.260]   living in the will of God,
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.900]   and I can do all things through Christ
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.820]   who gives me strength.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.260]   I claim the following attributes
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.260]   because I have the mind of Christ.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.540]   I am a confidant of God.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.620]   And by the way, I have scriptures that I use for these
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.260]   to convince myself of these things biblically.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.540]   And although I am weak in many of these qualities,
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:37.500]   I am specifically told to let the weak say I am strong.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.980]   So I am strong.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.940]   By claiming, developing, and using these biblical qualities,
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.540]   I will become the person God created me to be,
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:49.820]   and I will glorify God and benefit mankind.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:54.380]   I, Joshua Sheets, am an honest, intelligent,
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:58.700]   organized, responsible, committed, teachable person
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.620]   who is sober, loyal, and who clearly understands
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.020]   that regardless of who signs my paycheck,
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.700]   I am self-employed.
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:09.940]   I am an optimistic, punctual, enthusiastic,
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.900]   goal-setting, smart-working, self-starter
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.380]   who is a disciplined, focused, dependable,
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.900]   persistent, positive thinker with great self-control,
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:23.460]   and I am an energetic and diligent team player
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:26.420]   and hard worker who appreciates the opportunity
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:30.340]   my company and the free enterprise system offer me.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.380]   I am thrifty with my resources,
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.380]   and I apply common sense to my daily tasks.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.780]   I take honest pride in my competence, appearance,
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:42.500]   and manners, and am motivated to be and do my best
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.700]   so that my healthy self-image will remain on solid ground.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:49.940]   These are the qualities which enable me to manage myself
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:52.320]   and help give me employment security
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.140]   in a no-job security world.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:59.380]   I, Joshua Sheets, am a compassionate, respectful,
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.620]   encourager who is a considerate, generous,
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:08.620]   gentle, patient, caring, sensitive, personable,
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.820]   attentive, fun-loving person.
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:16.340]   I am a supportive, giving and forgiving,
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:21.060]   clean, kind, unselfish, affectionate, loving,
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.180]   family-oriented man, and I am a sincere
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.220]   and open-minded good listener
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.340]   and a good finder who is trustworthy.
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:30.860]   These are the qualities which enable me
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.220]   to build good relationships.
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:35.700]   I, Joshua Sheets, am a person of integrity
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.940]   with the faith and wisdom to know what I should do
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.260]   and the courage and conviction to follow through.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:45.740]   I have the vision to manage myself and to lead others.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.980]   I am authoritative, confident, and humbly grateful
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.220]   for the opportunity life offers me.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:55.900]   I am fair, flexible, resourceful,
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.180]   creative, knowledgeable, decisive,
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.660]   and an extra miler with a servant's attitude
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.860]   who communicates well with others.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:08.260]   I am a consistent, pragmatic teacher with character,
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.380]   and I have a finely-tuned sense of humor.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:13.140]   I am an honorable person
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:17.140]   and I'm balanced in my personal, family, and business life,
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.860]   and I have a passion for being, doing,
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.700]   and learning more today so I can be, do,
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.260]   and have more tomorrow.
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:30.260]   These are the qualities of the winner I was born to be,
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.620]   and I am fully committed to developing
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:37.300]   these marvelous qualities with which I have been entrusted.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.460]   And then you can go into either the morning version
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:44.300]   or the daytime version, et cetera.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.860]   But the last sentence that I like
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.580]   from the nighttime version is,
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.620]   recognizing, claiming, and developing these qualities,
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:53.900]   which I already have, gives me a legitimate chance
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.780]   to be happier, healthier, more prosperous, more secure,
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.300]   have more friends, greater peace of mind,
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.340]   better family relationships, and legitimate hope
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.980]   that the future will be even better.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.260]   So you can find the text of that.
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.980]   As I said, go online, search Zig Ziglar Affirmations,
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.020]   and you'll find it.
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:13.060]   But that's the basis of it.
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:18.060]   And I wish that I did this every day,
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:21.820]   but since I am honest, I cannot say that.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:24.660]   What I can say is that every time I engage
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:27.180]   in this practice, I feel better.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:31.020]   And as is common, when we do something that works,
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:34.500]   then we, because it works, we usually stop doing it,
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.500]   and it's frustrating about that.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:40.020]   And so what I will do is I tend to do it in phases, though,
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.540]   is that I listen to the recording,
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.140]   usually when I make my coffee,
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.780]   I have the little recording that I made
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.180]   with some dramatic movie score music, et cetera,
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.940]   of my voice reading it to myself.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.060]   I put my earbuds in while I wait for the water to heat,
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.820]   and I listen to that in the morning, and I like it,
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.220]   because it just causes me to want to,
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.260]   it makes me stand up straighter,
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.780]   'cause I recognize, yes, I am those things.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.700]   Those things do describe me.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.180]   They do describe me in a measure,
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.740]   and I want them to describe me more and more.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:13.060]   And what usually happens is, as I'm reading the list
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.080]   or listening to the list, et cetera,
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.220]   I'll find something where there's
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:18.340]   a little twinge of conscience.
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:21.940]   And for example, as I go through this now,
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.260]   and I say it's disciplined, right?
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.900]   Well, am I disciplined to do this thing
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.900]   that I'm telling you about
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.780]   that has been a good factor of my life?
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.660]   Well, no, and I haven't been super disciplined,
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.300]   but even as I'm recording this,
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.900]   then I sit up a little bit straighter, my chest goes up.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.940]   No, I'm gonna express discipline,
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.060]   I'm gonna cultivate discipline,
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.280]   and I'm gonna do this more frequently,
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.700]   'cause it's a healthy thing.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:46.020]   And then you recognize times when I wasn't compassionate,
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:49.860]   or I was unkind to someone, and it tweaks your conscience,
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.640]   and you can go and apologize or fix something.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.140]   But I think it's a very healthy habit.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:56.140]   And then the final thing is, I'm making that right now,
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:59.220]   I'm planning to give my children,
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.700]   well, I can get it done, 'cause it's a long list,
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.500]   but I'm making books for my children,
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.220]   and I'm gonna teach this affirmation to my children.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:10.220]   So I'm using AI to make inspirational,
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:13.460]   forward-looking pictures of these things.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:16.300]   And then I've created a set of text
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.740]   that's associated with each of these character qualities.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.400]   And this is kind of a component
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.820]   of my character education with my children,
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.620]   is I'm gonna give them all a printed photo book
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.640]   that have the AI images.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.220]   They love it when I make AI images for them.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:33.840]   So AI images of each of my children,
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.740]   forward, expressing these qualities.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.700]   And I believe that this is something that we need to do
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:42.020]   as part of our education, the same way that,
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:44.580]   so character education is important for us,
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.220]   and it's also important for our children.
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:50.260]   And so that begins by identifying character qualities.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.860]   And I've got a collection of about a half a dozen books
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:56.540]   that we go through that discuss different character qualities.
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.140]   So integrity, what does that mean?
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.020]   Responsibility, what is that?
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.780]   And my ambition and my hope is that I can set them
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:07.780]   on a stronger foundation by being intimately aware
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:11.180]   of the definition of these qualities,
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.140]   the fact that they have them,
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.700]   and the fact that they need to be developed.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.980]   And then I try to supplement that
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.580]   with lots of literature, et cetera, to reinforce that.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:25.080]   But that's the affirmations, that's how I use them.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.020]   Yes, I do them, not as much as I should.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.460]   Not as much as I will, based upon your reminding me
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.820]   of the importance of them, et cetera.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:38.540]   - Well, I'm looking forward to stealing a lot of that,
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.500]   and I'm inspired with my family as well
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.500]   to try to figure out how to implement that,
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.800]   just not for me, but also for my family.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.340]   I don't know if you have time for another question,
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.820]   but it was totally different on--
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.660]   - Sure, go ahead.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.860]   - You know, is Texas gonna secede?
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.940]   What do you think of the odds of that?
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:57.500]   And do you think there are, it's a good plan B potential,
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.100]   and if so, how might we do that beforehand?
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:03.500]   Maybe like buying a piece of property,
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.880]   do you think that might help with the residency
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.820]   at some point down the line?
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.180]   Or what are your thoughts on that?
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.820]   Because you're one of the only people,
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.140]   weird enough that I respect,
[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.300]   that might actually have an opinion on this matter.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.980]   - Yeah, it's a fun question.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:18.540]   So, buying a piece of property,
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.580]   if you could do it, and it were a small,
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:24.860]   modest part of your life and your component,
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.580]   then absolutely, I would say, go for it.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:30.460]   Because after all, isn't it fun
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:33.040]   to have a little flag planted in a place
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:37.300]   that you appreciate or that you are interested in, et cetera?
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.940]   I think what would be a more practical thing
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.860]   than necessarily buying property
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:47.340]   is to change, if it were appropriate,
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:50.400]   and again, you can't commit fraud,
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:55.200]   but Texas is one of the states that allows nomad residency.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.960]   And so, you can be a resident of the state of Texas,
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:01.140]   if you were deeply convinced of the thesis
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.240]   that you're describing, that Texas may secede,
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:07.720]   and I wanna have a flag planted there,
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.940]   then you can be a resident of the state of Texas,
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.280]   with a Texas driver's license,
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.280]   a Texas mailing address, et cetera,
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.720]   even if you don't spend all of your time in Texas.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.520]   There are a few things to be careful of.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.720]   That's not a system that should be abused.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.840]   So, if you live in Minnesota
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.160]   and that's where you are all the time,
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:26.920]   then obviously, you need to,
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.440]   then you're probably gonna,
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:32.080]   a lot of your stuff is gonna reflect that.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.880]   But Texas is a state that would be relatively easy
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.240]   for many people to place a flag in.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.680]   Again, as I said, you could be a resident
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.840]   of the state of Texas, formally, officially,
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.000]   legally with the court system, et cetera.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.100]   You would just need to make sure
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.700]   that you weren't violating any local laws
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.840]   of where you spent more time
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.720]   if you weren't spending time in Texas.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.000]   I think the future of Texas is very strong.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.640]   It just seems that Texas has a great structure.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:00.440]   I listened to Peter Zeihan's analysis of it,
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:04.180]   and he goes on and on about Texas, the future of Texas,
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.800]   and I can't argue with his comments.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.060]   I think he's correct.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.800]   I've said to various people, I was like,
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:11.600]   hey, you probably ought to move to Texas
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.360]   and get potentially involved
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.120]   into the future growth of Texas.
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:23.120]   The Texas Triangle is powerfully enormous growth potential,
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.280]   and the integration of Texas with Mexico,
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.320]   enormous potential, et cetera.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.680]   So I think Texas has a very strong economic future.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.320]   I don't think there's any chance of Texas seceding,
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.960]   and it's not that technically they couldn't
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.600]   in the sense that all the arguments for Texas secession,
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.160]   and look, we've got, we're a,
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.040]   oh, what do they call the state?
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.360]   What's the name they use for the Republic of Texas, I guess?
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.880]   Is that the name that they call Texas?
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.360]   - I'm sorry, go ahead, what was that?
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.800]   - Sorry, what is the thing that Texans call themselves?
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.200]   Like, we're not a republic,
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.160]   but they don't call themselves a state.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.920]   They call themselves something else.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.760]   Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.640]   - Oh, yeah, I think it's the Republic of Texas,
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.260]   I don't think.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:10.160]   - So in their state constitution,
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.640]   we've got the Republic of Texas, et cetera,
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.440]   and we're the Republic of Texas,
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.640]   we've got an independent power grid,
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.640]   we're one of the few people that could secede.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.320]   So could they do it?
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.480]   Yeah, probably so.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.320]   My answer on that is quite simply
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:31.280]   that I think the entire idea of a state
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.280]   being able to secede from the United States federal entity
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.980]   was decided in the Civil War,
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.880]   and I'm no Civil War historian,
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.200]   but as far as I can tell,
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.520]   the actions of the South to secede from the Union
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.520]   were entirely legal.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.720]   I can't see any law that they broke
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.960]   by seceding from the South.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:57.000]   As distasteful as it is to talk about slavery
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.480]   and all of the issues associated with it,
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:03.280]   as far as I can tell from a strict legal perspective,
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.120]   it seems persuasive to me that the South
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.200]   and the Southern states were able, legally speaking,
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.480]   to secede from the Union.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.520]   And Abraham Lincoln, as much as we wish to lionize him
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.720]   for his anti-slavery work,
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.720]   Abraham Lincoln broke enormous swaths of law and precedent
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.340]   in order to prosecute the war against the South.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:29.040]   And the war happened,
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.240]   and I think that was where it was settled,
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.200]   is that the official stance of the United States
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.560]   is basically once you're in, you ain't getting out.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.600]   Now, I'm just shooting from the hip.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.280]   Imagine we're having a cold drink together,
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.760]   that's what I would say.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.220]   Maybe someone could convince me of that,
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.460]   but when I think about the clear legal arguments
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:54.760]   that the Southern states had for the Confederacy,
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.880]   when I think about what the process they did,
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.640]   they did secede from the Union
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.080]   to establish the Confederate States of America, et cetera,
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.680]   and then how that war was ultimately prosecuted,
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.560]   then I think the same basic thing that happened then
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.960]   would happen again.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.040]   And so, as I understand the history of the Civil War,
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.040]   an enormous component of the Civil War was around tariffs
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:29.600]   and around, basically, economic policies
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.280]   of keeping the country integrated.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.080]   A significant component of it
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:37.160]   was also the arguments over slavery,
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.880]   but it wasn't exclusively over slavery,
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.640]   and it wasn't exclusively over economics and tariffs
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:50.800]   and who had the right to collect taxes.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:51.800]   When I was in high school,
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.780]   I wrote a paper for a history class
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.300]   in which I argued that the Civil War was not about slavery,
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:59.640]   not about ending slavery.
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.680]   And in that paper, I quoted all of President Lincoln's
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.240]   addresses in which he said,
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.900]   "I'm not interested in ending slavery."
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:12.000]   I now believe that I was wrong in high school, I was naive,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.880]   and that Lincoln was engaging in political convenience
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:20.880]   by not fully stating publicly his ambition to end slavery,
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:25.040]   but simply keeping that in reserve
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.800]   as trying to basically say one thing.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.920]   Basically the same thing Barack Obama did
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.560]   around the concept of homosexual marriage, et cetera.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.480]   I'm gonna say one thing, do another, et cetera,
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.320]   no difference.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.760]   So I think Lincoln did the same thing.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.880]   But those issues were related.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.320]   And so if Texas seceded,
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.960]   what would be the justification for that secession?
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.680]   So there would have to be a lot of change
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.720]   that would happen in order for that kind of thing
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.980]   to be supported more broadly.
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:54.500]   Now, I was encouraged to see that,
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.340]   was it like 20 states, 22 states or something like that,
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:01.680]   signed the letter about the recent scuffle at the border,
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.000]   and that a lot of other state governors
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.320]   were willing to put their names down.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:10.320]   And so I think that there is enough of a pressure
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.120]   that I think the actions of the federal government
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:16.280]   may be somewhat limited because of some of this pressure.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.800]   So I expect some kind of significant political change.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.080]   And I think that this is much more,
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.720]   I'm pretty persuaded of the thesis
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.880]   that the current scenario in the United States,
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.280]   the frustration, the vitriol, the arguing, the fighting,
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:36.360]   is more of a turning of the age
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.400]   than it is of any specific thing.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.400]   And I first became persuaded of that by reading George,
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:51.400]   the geopolitical, George Friedman's book
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.480]   called "The Storm Before the Calm."
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:55.440]   And he talked about the cyclical nature
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.360]   and the two trends in the United States
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.960]   that are converging on the 2020s
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.960]   and why he predicted years ago
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.860]   the 2020s were gonna be hugely,
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:09.080]   hugely frustrating and filled with anger and vitriol,
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.920]   et cetera, but it was gonna lead
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.440]   to a complete transformation of the political system
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.840]   and of the economic system in the United States.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.520]   And then finally, a listener convinced me,
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.400]   and I'm halfway through the recent book,
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:22.680]   "The Fourth Turning is Here,"
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.580]   and I find his arguments persuasive
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.920]   of the cyclical nature of the seculum
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.120]   in "The Fourth Turning" arguments.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.640]   I never read the original one, and I knew that I should,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.040]   but I just got annoyed by everyone
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.520]   who went on and on about "The Fourth Turning,"
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.600]   and so I'd never read the book
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.840]   'cause I just got annoyed by the people
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.000]   who promoted the book.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.360]   So I'm reading "The Fourth Turning is Here,"
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.680]   and it seems persuasive to me.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:45.400]   So I think that we're just in kind of
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.800]   a fairly intense period in the 2020s,
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:51.480]   and that intensity is gonna lead
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:54.360]   to a transformation of the political system,
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   a transformation of the economic system,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.040]   and we're gonna emerge in the 2030s, mid-2030s,
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:02.840]   something like that, with a new and unrecognizable system
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:06.000]   because that's what happened about four or five times before
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.080]   in the American system.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.920]   And I see good historical evidence for that
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.080]   that goes a lot farther than expecting a civil war.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.160]   So those are my thoughts.
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.060]   Who knows, we'll sit back and watch and see what happens.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.640]   - Thank you very much, love hearing it.
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.920]   - My pleasure, and thank you for the good questions.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:32.000]   As we close, I think it was that caller who mentioned
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.160]   that I am indeed hosting a Radical Family Camp.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.280]   If you are interested in that,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.080]   check out the previous show that I just did,
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.080]   the one right before this show in the podcast feed.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.640]   You can find all of the details on that,
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   and if you'd like to sign up for that,
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.520]   go to www.radicalfamilycamp.com.
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.320]   Move soon, again, the early bird sale tickets
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320]   are more than half sold out.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.580]   So go to radicalfamilycamp.com.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.280]   Basically, the short version is that
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.920]   we're gonna have a great three-day camp together,
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:03.160]   financial conversations, lifestyle conversations,
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.440]   camp activities for you, for your children, et cetera,
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.360]   and just hanging out.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.160]   So I'll be there with my wife and all of our children,
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:12.260]   and very excited to start moving our relationship
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:14.120]   out of the digital world and into the physical world.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.240]   We can argue about the next civil war
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.440]   and the causes of the last one, et cetera,
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.300]   around a campfire.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.200]   I look forward to that conversation
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.960]   and hearing your input on that.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.000]   Also, if you would like to join me on next week's show,
