[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Sadly, the original master recording of the following sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones did not survive.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.300]   However, we have been able to obtain a very poor quality copy of the sermon
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.900]   and processed it digitally to improve the quality.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.500]   However, we do hope this will not spoil your enjoyment of the following sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.700]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.200]   are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint Luke in the eighth chapter, verses 22 to 25.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.700]   Verses 22 to 25 in the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Luke.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.200]   "Now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   and he said unto them, 'Let us go over unto the other side of the lake.'
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   And they launched forth.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   But as they sailed, he fell asleep.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.700]   And they came to him and awoke him, saying, 'Master, master, we perish.'
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.700]   Then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a great calm.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700]   And he said unto them, 'Where is your faith?'
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.700]   And they, being afraid, wondered, saying one to another, 'What manner of men is this?
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.700]   For he commended even the winds and water, and they obeyed him."
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700]   Now I want to call attention particularly to that question
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700]   which was addressed by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to these disciples.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.700]   He said unto them, "Where is your faith? Where is your faith?"
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   I call your attention to this entire incident as a part of our consideration on these Sunday mornings
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   of the subject of what we have described as spiritual depression.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.700]   We are considering the various causes why it is, unfortunately, alas, the truth to say
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   that certain Christian people are miserable.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.700]   We are considering the case of the miserable Christian, the unhappy Christian,
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.700]   the one who is suffering from spiritual depression.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   We have already considered a number of causes,
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   and we are looking at this particular incident in the life and ministry of our Lord
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   because it brings us face to face with yet another cause.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   And the one that obviously is dealt with here is the whole problem and question of the nature of faith.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.700]   In other words, there are many Christians who get into difficulties and are unhappy from time to time
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   because they clearly have not understood the nature of faith.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   Well, you say, "If they haven't understood the nature of faith, how can they be Christians?"
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.700]   The answer is this. What makes one Christian is that one is given the gift of faith.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   We are given the gift of faith by God through the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   and we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that saves us.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   But that doesn't mean that we understand the nature of faith.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.700]   And so it comes to pass that while we may be truly Christian and genuinely saved
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   because we've received this gift of faith,
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   we may subsequently get into trouble in our spiritual experience
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.700]   because we haven't understood the nature of faith.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.700]   It's originally given us a gift, but from there on, as I hope to show you this morning,
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   we have to do certain things about it.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   Now, this is a very striking incident which brings out that vital importance
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   of distinguishing between the gift of faith originally
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.700]   and the walk of faith or the life of faith which comes subsequently.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   God starts us off in this life, then we have to walk in this life.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   We walk by faith, not by sight, and so on.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   Well, very well. Now, that's the theme which we're considering together this morning.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   Before I come actually to that particular theme,
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.700]   we must say just a few words about this great incident in and of itself.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   Looked at from any standpoint, it's a very interesting and a very important incident.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   It has a great deal to tell us, for instance, about the person of our Lord himself.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   It brings us face to face with what is described as the paradox,
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.700]   the seeming contradiction in the person of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   There he is, weary and tired, so tired in fact that he fell asleep.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.700]   Now, this incident is recorded by the three so-called synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   and it is very important from the standpoint of understanding the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.700]   I say, you look at him and you say, "Obviously, he's a man.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   He's fatigued, he's tired, he's weary, so much so that he just falls asleep.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   And though a storm arises, he still goes on sleeping.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.700]   He's subject to infirmity.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.700]   He's a man in the body and the flesh like all the rest of us.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   A man, you say. Ah, yes, but wait a minute.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   Listen to this. They came to him and awoke him saying, "Master, Master, we perish."
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   Then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the sea, and they ceased.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   And there was a calm.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.700]   One of the others describes it as a great calm.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   Oh, it's not surprising that the disciples, seeing all this, wondered and said one to another,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   "What manner of man is this? For he commendeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   Well, there it is. Man, and yet obviously God.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.700]   He can commend the elements. He can silence the wind and stop the raging of the sea.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.700]   He's the Lord of nature and of creation. He's the Lord of the universe.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:43.700]   He is. This is the mystery and the marvel of Jesus Christ, God and man.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   Two natures, one person. Two natures unmixed, yet resident in the same person.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:59.700]   Well, I say it is a very remarkable and striking illustration of that great and all important fact.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   And we must start with it, because if we're not clear about that, there's no purpose in our going on.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:13.700]   If you don't believe in the unique deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, well, you're just not a Christian, whatever else you may be.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.700]   We are not looking at a good man only.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   We are not interested merely in the greatest teacher that the world has ever seen.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   We are face to face with the fact that God, the eternal Son, has been in this world and took upon him human nature
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.700]   and dwelt amongst us, a man amongst men, God-man.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.700]   The mystery, the marvel of the incarnation, the virgin birth, it's all here.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   And here it shines out in all the fullness of its amazing glory.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.700]   What manner of man is this? He's more than man, that's the answer. He's God-man.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:08:00.700]   However, I say that is not, it seems to me, the special purpose of this particular incident.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:06.700]   You get that in other places also. It shines out right through all the Gospels.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   But these separate particular incidents in which that is seen,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.700]   generally also have some special and peculiar lesson of their own to teach us.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:24.700]   And there can be no doubt, as I've suggested, that that peculiar and special message in this particular case
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:35.700]   is this lesson with regard to the disciples and with regard to their condition at this point.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   It's a great lesson concerning faith and the nature or the character of faith.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   I don't know what you feel, but I never cease to be grateful to these disciples.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.700]   I'm grateful to them for every mistake they ever made, for every blunder they ever committed,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   because I see myself in them.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.700]   How grateful we should be to God that we have these scriptures.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.700]   How grateful to God that he hasn't merely given us an experience and left it at that.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.700]   How wonderful it is that we can read an account like this and see ourselves in it.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.700]   And how grateful to God that it's a divinely inspired word that speaks the truth
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.700]   and doesn't try to paint pictures of its heroes as if they were perfect.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.700]   It shows us them in all their human limitations and fallibility.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700]   It records all their mistakes and all their failures, and here they are.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:35.700]   And so we find our Lord rebuking these men.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:42.700]   He rebukes them because of their alarm, because of their terror, because of their lack of faith.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.700]   Here they are, you see, they're in the boat with him, and the storm arises,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.700]   and they've done everything they can to bail out the water, but it's getting filled up.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.700]   We are told they were filled with water, and they could see that in a few moments the ship was going to sink.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.700]   They've done everything they could, but it didn't seem to be of any value nor of any avail.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:06.700]   And what amuses them is that their master is still sleeping soundly in the stern of the vessel.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.700]   So they go to him, and they shake him, and they're waking him and say,
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.700]   "Master, master," as another one of these evangelists puts it, "carest thou not that we perish?
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.700]   Are you unconcerned about it all?"
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:26.700]   And he arose, and having rebuked the wind and having rebuked the sea, he rebuked them.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.700]   And we must be careful to observe this rebuke and to understand what he was saying.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.700]   What was our Lord saying to them?
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:41.700]   Well, he was rebuking them for one thing, for being in such a state at all.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.700]   "Where is your faith?" he says.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.700]   Some of the others put it, "Oh, ye of little faith."
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.700]   He marveled at their unbelief, we are told.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.700]   He rebukes them.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.700]   He rebukes them for being in that state of agitation and terror and of alarm while he is with them in the boat.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   Now, my friends, this is the first great lesson we have to point to ourselves and one another this morning.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.700]   It is very wrong for a Christian ever to be in such a condition.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   I don't care about the circumstances.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.700]   A Christian should never be agitated.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.700]   A Christian should never be beside himself like this.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.700]   A Christian should never be at his wits' ends and full of terror and alarm.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.700]   A Christian should never be in a condition in which he has lost control of himself.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.700]   That's the first lesson.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.700]   It's a lesson we've been pointing on several Sunday mornings.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.700]   But it's an essential part of the New Testament teaching.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:51.700]   A Christian should never be depressed, agitated, alarmed, frantic, not knowing what to do, like another worldly person.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.700]   You see, that's why it's so wrong.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.700]   This is a typical reaction on the part of those who are not Christians.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   But a Christian is different from other people.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.700]   A Christian has something which the non-Christian doesn't possess.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   And the idea for the Christian is that which is stated so perfectly by the Apostle Paul, you remember, in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.700]   "I have learned in whatsoever state I am therein to be content.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.700]   I know both how to be at peace and how to abound.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.700]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me."
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.700]   That's the Christian position.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.700]   That's what the Christian is meant to be like.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.700]   The Christian, I say, is never meant to be carried away by his feelings, whatever they are.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.700]   Never.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.700]   That is always wrong in the Christian.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.700]   The Christian is always to be controlled, as I'm going on to show you.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.700]   The trouble with these men was that they were lacking in self-control.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.700]   And that's why they were miserable. That's why they were unhappy.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:00.700]   That's why they were alarmed and agitated, though the Son of God is with them in the boat.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   I can't emphasize this too strongly.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.700]   I'm simply laying it down as a proposition.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.700]   The Christian should never lose self-control.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:24.700]   The Christian is never meant to be in a state of agitation and terror and alarm, whatever the circumstances.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.700]   That's obviously the first lesson, isn't it?
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.700]   The position of these people was desperate.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.700]   They were in jeopardy.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.700]   It looked as if they were going to be drowned the next moment.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.700]   Yet our Lord says, "You shouldn't be in that condition, you know.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.700]   Being my followers, my people, you have no right to be as you are, though you're in jeopardy."
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.700]   Very well. That's the first great lesson.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.700]   And of course the second is this.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:14:01.700]   What is so wrong about this condition is that it implies a lack of trust and a lack of confidence in him.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.700]   That's the problem.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.700]   And that is why it is so reprehensible.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.700]   That is why he reprimanded these men at this point.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:16.700]   He was saying in effect to them, "Do you feel like this in spite of the fact that I am with you?
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.700]   Don't you trust me?"
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:26.700]   As I say, one of the other evangelists reports it like that, that they said to him, "Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.700]   No, I don't think they were referring only to themselves.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:33.700]   Some people have suggested that, that they were so self-centered and self-concerned that what they said to him was this,
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   "Master, don't you care that we are going to be drowned?"
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.700]   Without considering him. I don't believe they meant that for a moment.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.700]   I think they were including him as well.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.700]   They said that he and they were all going to be drowned.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.700]   "Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:15:01.700]   In other words, this agitation and alarm and violent concern always carries implicit in it a lack of trust and a lack of confidence in him.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.700]   It's a lack of faith in his concern for us and in his care for us.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.700]   It means that we take charge again and are going to look after ourselves and the situation,
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.700]   feeling that he doesn't care and that he can't, perhaps.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.700]   And that is what makes this so terrible.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.700]   But I wonder whether we always realize that.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.700]   It seems fairly obvious as we look on at it objectively in the case of these disciples, doesn't it?
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   That my friend, when you and I are agitated or disturbed or don't know what to do
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.700]   and give an impression of that nervous tension and that apprehension,
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   anybody looking at us is entitled to say this,
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.700]   "That person hasn't much faith in his or her Lord.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.700]   There doesn't seem to be much point in being a Christian after all.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   There isn't much value in Christianity, but look at that person."
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   Now, we were all subject to this during the war and the air raids,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.700]   but whatever comes across our path and puts us in difficulties,
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.700]   at once we proclaim what we really think about him and believe in him
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   by our response and our reaction to it.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:14.700]   So that there, it seems to me, on the very surface of these two great lessons,
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.700]   we must never allow ourselves to become agitated and disturbed in this way
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.700]   because to do so implies a lack of faith, a lack of trust,
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:31.700]   a lack of confidence in our blessed Lord and God.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.700]   However, let's go and look at it in detail.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.700]   There are the two great lessons.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:45.700]   But now let us draw some general principles out of this incident and its great teaching.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   First of all, in looking at this whole question of faith,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:57.700]   let me say a word about what I may call the trial of faith, the trial of faith.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.700]   Scripture is full of this idea of the trial of one's faith.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   Take that great three-length chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   the portion of which we read at the beginning.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   That's in a sense nothing but a great exposition on this theme of the trial of faith.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.700]   Every one of those men was tried.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   He'd been given a great promise and he'd accepted it,
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   and then, well, everything seemed to go wrong.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   Think of any one of them you like. It's too available.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   Think of the trials of a man like Noah, trials of a man like Abraham,
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:35.700]   the trials that Jacob had to endure, and Moses especially.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.700]   Yes, given the gift of faith, but then the faith is tried.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.700]   Peter, in writing his first epistle in the first chapter, has exactly the same thing.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   He says that they were in heaviness for a season because of certain circumstances,
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.700]   but he says that the object of that is that the trial of your faith, he says,
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.700]   which is more precious than of gold that perisheth,
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.700]   at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.700]   That's it, that the trial of your faith, which is much more precious than gold,
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.700]   that perisheth and so on.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.700]   I say that this is the theme of the Scripture.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.700]   You get it in the Patriarchs and all the Old Testament saints.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   You get it running through the New Testament, and of course it's the great theme
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.700]   of the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.700]   Well, very well, then, let's be clear about this.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.700]   We must start by learning that we may well find ourselves
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.700]   in which our faith is going to be tried.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.700]   Storms are allowed by God.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.700]   If we enter into the Christian life, or are trying to live the Christian life at the moment
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   under the assumption that it means just this, come to Christ and you'll never have another worry
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   in the whole of your life, it's a terrible fallacy.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.700]   In fact, it's a delusion.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.700]   It's not true.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.700]   Our faith will be tried, and James goes so far as to say, "Count it all, joy, my brethren,"
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.700]   when we fall into diverse temptations or trials.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.700]   Oh, yes, God permits storms.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   He permits difficulties.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.700]   He permits the wind to blow and the billows to roll,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.700]   and everything seems to be going wrong, and we're in jeopardy.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:41.700]   Now we've got to realize that as we come to try to understand this whole question of faith.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:48.700]   God doesn't take his people and lead them into some kind of Elysium
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.700]   in which they're protected magically from all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.700]   Not at all.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   We're living in the same world as everybody else.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.700]   Indeed, the apostle Paul seems to go further than that.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.700]   He says to the Philippians, "Unto you it is given on the behalf of Christ not only to believe in him,
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.700]   but also to suffer shame for his name's sake."
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.700]   "In the world," says the Lord himself, "in the world ye shall have tribulations."
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.700]   "But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.700]   Yes, but remember, you'll have the tribulations.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.700]   Paul again and Barnabas going on their missionary journey visited the churches and said,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   "It is through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God."
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.700]   "Very well," then I say, "we must start by realizing that."
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.700]   To be forewarned is to be forearmed in this matter.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.700]   If we have a semi-magical conception of the Christian life,
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.700]   we are certain to find ourselves sooner or later in trouble.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.700]   Because when the difficulties come, we say, "Why is this happening? Why is this allowed?"
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.700]   "If God still loves me, are his promises true?"
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.700]   And we should never ask such questions, and we never would ask them,
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   if we only realize this principle,
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:09.700]   that the Lord enters the ship and goes to sleep and allows the storm to come.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:16.700]   And I say that the position may indeed become quite desperate in jeopardy.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   Everything seems to be against us.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.700]   Well, here it is again, I say that, and it reminds me of the hymn.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.700]   A Christian man writes like this,
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:30.700]   "When all things seem against me, to drive me to despair."
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.700]   It doesn't drive him to despair because he goes on to say,
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:39.700]   "I know one gate is open, one ear will hear my prayer."
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.700]   But things themselves are desperate.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:49.700]   "When all things seem against me," says the Christian, "to drive me to despair."
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.700]   Now, let's be prepared for that.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.700]   Yes, but we must even go further.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:04.700]   While all this is happening to us, he appears to be utterly concerned about it.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.700]   That's where the trial of faith comes in, isn't it?
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.700]   The wind and the billows were bad enough, and the water was coming into the ship.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   All that was terrible.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:22.700]   But the thing that was to them most terrible of all was his apparent unconcern, still sleeping.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:28.700]   Not caring apparently, must a terrorist or not that we perish.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:35.700]   He appears to be unconcerned, unconcerned about us, unconcerned about himself,
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.700]   unconcerned about his cause, unconcerned about his kingdom.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.700]   Just imagine the feelings of these men.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.700]   They had gone after him, and they'd listened to his teaching about the coming of the kingdom,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.700]   they'd seen his miracles, and they were expecting marvelous things to happen.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.700]   And now it looked as if everything was going to end in shipwreck and in being drowned.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:00.700]   What an empty climax, because of his unconcern.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:06.700]   Oh, we must be very young indeed in the Christian life,
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.700]   unless we know something about this.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.700]   Don't we all know something about this position of trial and of difficulty?
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.700]   Yes, and a feeling that God somehow doesn't seem to care.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.700]   He doesn't do anything about it.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   Why does he allow me to suffer as a Christian at the hands of a non-Christian, says the person.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.700]   Why does he allow things to go wrong with me and not to go wrong with the other person?
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.700]   Why is that man successful and I unsuccessful?
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.700]   Why doesn't God do something about it?
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.700]   Oh, how often have Christian people asked that question.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.700]   They have asked it about the whole state of the church today.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.700]   They say, "Why doesn't God send revival?
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.700]   Why does he allow these infidels and skeptics, these rationalists, to attack the faith?
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.700]   Why doesn't God come in and do something and revive his work? Why not?"
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.700]   How often we are tempted to say such things, exactly as these people were.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:09.700]   He permits these things, and he even appears to be quite unconcerned about it all.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:16.700]   Now, all that constitutes what I am describing as the trial of faith.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.700]   Those are the conditions in which our faith is tried and tested and sifted,
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.700]   and God allows it all, I say. God permits it all.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:31.700]   And James goes on to say, "Count it all joy, my brethren, when that happens to you."
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.700]   Oh, this is a great subject, this.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.700]   The trial of faith.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.700]   We don't talk much about this, do we?
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:48.700]   But if you went back to the 17th and the 18th century, you'd find it was a very great theme.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:55.700]   I suppose in many ways it was the central theme of the Puritans, the trial of faith.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:01.700]   It was equally the theme of the leaders of the evangelical awakening.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:07.700]   The trial of immense faith, the walk of faith, the life of faith,
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.700]   and how to overcome these things.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.700]   Very well, leave it at that. Let's go on to our second question.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.700]   What is the nature of faith, the character of faith?
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:24.700]   Now, this is above everything the particular message of this incident.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:30.700]   And I feel that it is brought out especially in this record of this event in the gospel according to St. Luke,
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.700]   and that's why I'm taking this incident from this particular gospel.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.700]   The way in which Our Lord puts the question, "Where is your faith?"
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.700]   Now, there's the key to the whole problem.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:50.700]   You see, Our Lord's question, it seems to me, implies this,
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.700]   that he knows perfectly well that they have faith.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.700]   The question he asks them is this, "Where is it?"
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.700]   You've got it, but where is it?
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.700]   Where is your faith?
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.700]   You've got your faith, but where is it at this moment?
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.700]   It ought to be here, but it isn't here. Where is it?
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.700]   Now, then that gives us the key to the understanding of the nature of faith.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.700]   Let me first of all put it negatively.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:24.700]   Faith, obviously, is not a mere matter of feeling.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.700]   You see, faith is patently not a matter of feeling,
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   because one's feelings in this kind of condition cannot be very happy and very pleasurable.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.700]   A Christian is not a man who's asked to feel happy when everything goes wrong.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.700]   As I pointed out a few Sunday mornings ago,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.700]   he's never told to be happy when things are going wrong,
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.700]   but he's told to rejoice when they're going wrong.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.700]   Feelings belong to this happiness.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   Rejoicing, it takes in something much bigger than feelings.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.700]   And the danger is that if we regard faith as merely a matter of feeling,
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.700]   when things go wrong, the feeling will go, and the faith will seem to go.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.700]   But you see, faith is not a matter of feeling at all.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.700]   Faith, as we've already seen, it takes up the whole man,
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.700]   its mind, its intellect, its understanding, its reception of truth,
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.700]   and what I'm going to say.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.700]   But clearly, it isn't a mere matter of feeling.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.700]   Ah, but the second thing is still more important.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:29.700]   Faith is not something that acts automatically.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.700]   Faith is not something that acts magically.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:39.700]   Now this, I think, is the blunder of which we've all at some time or another been guilty.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:45.700]   We seem to think that faith is something that acts automatically.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.700]   Many people, it seems to me, conceive of faith
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.700]   as if it were something similar to those thermostats, you know,
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.700]   which you have in connection with heating apparatus.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:03.700]   Unfortunately, the next few moments of this sermon by Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones are missing.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.700]   However, the following paragraph is taken from a transcript of the sermon.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.700]   Many people, it seems to me, conceive of faith
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.700]   as if it were something similar to those thermostats
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.700]   which you have in connection with the heating apparatus.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.700]   You set your thermostat at a given level,
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.700]   you want to maintain the temperature to a certain point,
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.700]   and it acts automatically.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.700]   If the temperature is tending to rise above that,
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.700]   the thermostat comes into operation and brings it down.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.700]   If you use your hot water and the temperature is lowered,
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.700]   the thermostat comes into operation and sends it up.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.700]   You do not have to do anything about it.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.700]   The thermostat acts automatically,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.700]   and it brings the temperature back to the desired level automatically.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.700]   Now there are many people who seem to think that faith acts like that.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.700]   They assume that it doesn't matter what happens to them,
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.700]   that faith will operate and all will be well.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:04.700]   Faith, however, is not something that acts magically or automatically.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.700]   If it did, these men would never have been in trouble.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.700]   Faith would have come into operation,
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.700]   and they would have been calm and quiet,
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.700]   and all would have been well.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.700]   But faith is not like that,
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.700]   and those are utter fallacies with respect to it.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.700]   What is faith?
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.700]   Let us look at it positively.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.700]   The principle taught here is that faith is an activity.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.700]   It is something that has to be exercised.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.700]   It doesn't come into operation itself.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   You and I have to put it into operation.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.700]   It is a form of activity.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   And it is at this point we rejoin the Doctor.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.700]   Now let me divide that up a little.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.700]   Faith, I say, is something that you and I have to bring into operation.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.700]   That's exactly what our Lord said to these men.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.700]   He said, "Where is your faith?
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.700]   Why are you not taking your faith and applying it to this position?
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.700]   Where is it?"
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:10.700]   You see, it is something that you and I have to put into operation.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.700]   And it was because they hadn't done that
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.700]   that the disciples had become agitated and unhappy
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.700]   and were in this state of consternation.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.700]   But I'll answer someone,
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.700]   "How does one put faith into operation?"
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.700]   What do you mean?
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.700]   What do you mean by saying that faith is something
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.700]   that we have to apply and to put into operation?
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.700]   Well, I divide it in this way.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.700]   The first thing that I must do
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.700]   when I find myself in this difficult position is
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:47.700]   I must refuse to allow myself to be controlled by the situation.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.700]   That's the first thing.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   Again, that's a negative, you see.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.700]   These men are in the boat, the Master's asleep,
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   and the billows are rolling and the water's coming in
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.700]   and they can't bail it out fast enough
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.700]   and it looks as if they're going to sink.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.700]   Now then, the trouble was they were immediately controlled by that.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.700]   They said, "Oh, Lord, what can we do?"
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.700]   They should have been...
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.700]   Men who should have applied their fancy
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.700]   should have taken charge of the situation.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.700]   They should have said, "No, we're not going to be panicked."
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.700]   What is this position?
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700]   They should have started thinking.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   But they didn't start thinking.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   They allowed the position to control them
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.700]   and they became panicked.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.700]   Faith, therefore, is a refusal to panic.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.700]   Do you like that sort of definition of faith?
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.700]   Does that seem to you to be too earthly
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   and insufficiently spiritual?
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.700]   My dear friend, it's the essence of faith.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:48.700]   Faith is a refusal to panic, come what may.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   Browning, you know, I think he'd got that kind of idea in his mind
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.700]   when he defined faith like this.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   Faith, he said, you know, is like unbelief kept quiet
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.700]   like the snake 'neath Michael's foot.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.700]   He's got a picture of it.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.700]   Here is this man Michael standing
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.700]   and there's a snake beneath his foot wriggling
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.700]   ready to bite him and to kill him
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.700]   and he just keeps him quiet by the pressure of his foot.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.700]   Faith, look there from one angle,
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   is nothing but unbelief in the form of a serpent
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.700]   kept quiet, kept down.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.700]   That's what these men didn't do.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.700]   They allowed all these things to grip them
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.700]   and to grasp them and to control them
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.700]   and they were finished, they became panicked.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.700]   Faith is a refusal to become panicked.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.700]   It says, I'm not going to be controlled
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   by events and circumstances, whatever they are.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.700]   Are you in control?
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.700]   You take charge of yourself, you pull yourself up,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.700]   you control yourself, you don't let yourself go,
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.700]   you don't become a victim, you assault yourself.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.700]   That's the first thing.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.700]   But of course it doesn't stop at that.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.700]   That isn't enough.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.700]   That might lead to nothing but resignation
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.700]   or a kind of stoical calm.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.700]   That isn't the essence of faith, it's this.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   Having done that, and you've got to do that first,
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.700]   because if you don't control events, they'll control you.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.700]   But having done that, you do this.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.700]   You then go on to remind yourself
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.700]   of what you believe and what you know.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   Again, you see, that's what these foolish disciples didn't do.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.700]   If they'd only stopped for a moment and had said,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.700]   well now, what about it?
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.700]   Is it possible that we are going to drown with him in the boat?
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.700]   Is there anything that he can't do?
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.700]   We've seen his miracles.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.700]   He can turn water into wine.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.700]   He can heal the blind and the lame,
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.700]   can even raise the dead.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   Is it likely that he is going to allow us and himself
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.700]   to be drowned in this way?
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.700]   Impossible.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.700]   In any case, he loves us.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.700]   He cares for us.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.700]   He's told us that all the hairs of our head are numbered.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.700]   That's the way faith reasons, you see.
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.700]   It says, all right, I see the billows and the waves,
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.700]   and I see the water coming in, but!
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.700]   It puts up its butt.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.700]   It puts up its protus.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.700]   That's faith.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.700]   It holds on to truth.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.700]   It says, I know this.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.700]   I put this against that.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.700]   That's the application of it, you see.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.700]   These men didn't do that.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   And that is why they became agitated and excited and panicked.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.700]   And that is why you and I, whenever we become panicky and agitated,
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   have failed to do the same thing.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.700]   My friend, whatever your circumstances,
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.700]   stand, wait for a moment and say,
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.700]   all right, I admit it all, but!
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:39.700]   But what?
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   But God.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   But the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.700]   But what?
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.700]   The whole of my salvation.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.700]   That's what faith does.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.700]   All things seem against me to drive me to despair.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.700]   I don't know what's happening, what's taking place.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.700]   But I know this.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   I know that God has so loved me
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.700]   that he sent his only begotten Son into this world for me.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.700]   I know that while I was an enemy,
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.700]   God sent his only Son to die on the cross of Calvary's hill for me.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:29.700]   He's done that for me while I was an enemy, a rebel and an alien.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   I know that the Son of God loved me
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.700]   and gave himself for me.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:41.700]   I know that it is at the cost of his life and his blood that I have salvation,
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.700]   that I am a child of God and an heir of everlasting and eternal bliss.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   I know that.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.700]   Well, very well then, I know this.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:57.700]   That if while we were enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son,
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   how much more shall we be saved by his life?
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   It's inevitable logic.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.700]   Now, faith argues like this.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   Faith, you see, reminds itself of what the Scriptures call the exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   Faith says, "I can't believe that he who's brought me so far is going to let me go down at this point."
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.700]   It's impossible.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.700]   He doesn't do things like that.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.700]   It would be inconsistent with the character of God.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   So faith, having stood and refusing to be controlled,
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   reminds itself of what it believes and what it knows.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.700]   And then the next step is this.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:47.700]   It applies all that to this particular situation.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.700]   And you see, that was what these men hadn't done,
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   and that's why our Lord puts it like this to them.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.700]   Where is your faith?
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.700]   You've got it.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.700]   Why didn't you apply it?
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.700]   Why didn't you bring all you know to bear upon this situation?
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   Why didn't you focus it on this particular problem?
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.700]   That's the next step in the application of faith.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.700]   Where is it?
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.700]   Well, my friend, whatever your circumstances at this moment,
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   bring all you know to be true about your relationship to God, to bear upon it.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.700]   That's all.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.700]   And then you'll know this full well,
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.700]   that he will never allow anything to happen to you that is harmful.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   All things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.700]   Not a hair of your head shall suffer.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.700]   He loves you with an everlasting love.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.700]   I don't suggest that you'll be able to understand everything that's happening.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.700]   You won't have a full explanation of it all, but you'll know that for certain,
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   that God is not unconcerned.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.700]   It's impossible.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   The one who's done this big thing must be concerned about you.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.700]   And though the clouds are there and you can't see his face,
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.700]   you know he's there behind a frowning prominence.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   He hides a father's face.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.700]   No, you hold on to that.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.700]   You say, "I don't see him smiling, but I know he is smiling.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.700]   These earth-born clouds prevent my seeing him,
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   but I know he's there and he'll never suffer anything harmful to take place."
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.700]   That's the language of faith.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.700]   You've applied it to the present position.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.700]   And that is the great lesson of faith.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.700]   I don't care what's happening to you.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.700]   It may be some great disappointment.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.700]   It may be an illness.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.700]   It may be some sort of tragedy.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   It may be some treachery.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.700]   I don't know what it is.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.700]   But you can be certain of this,
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.700]   that God permits that thing to happen to you because it's ultimately for your good.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.700]   No chastening for the present is pleasurable or joyous,
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.700]   but grievous rather.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:04.700]   But afterward, it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.700]   My friend, that's the way faith works.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.700]   But you see, you and I have got to do it.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.700]   It doesn't come into operation automatically.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.700]   No, no. You've got to face these things and say, "All right,
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.700]   but I know this about God, and because that is true,
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.700]   I'm going to apply it to this, and this can't be what I think it is.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.700]   It must be something else."
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:29.700]   And you end by seeing that it's God's gracious purpose for you.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   And then, of course, having applied it, you just hold on to it.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.700]   You just refuse to be moved.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.700]   The enemy will come back and he'll attack you.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   The water will seem to be pouring in.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.700]   You just say, "It's all right. I know. It's all right.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   Let the worst come to the worst." You stand on your faith.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.700]   You say, "I believe this. I'm resting on this.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   I'm certain of this, and whether I understand or not,
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.700]   I'm holding on to this." That's it.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.700]   Well, that brings me to a final word, which is my third principle.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   The value of even the weakest or the smallest faith.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.700]   We've looked at the trial of faith.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.700]   We've looked at the nature of faith.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   Let me say just a closing word on the value of even the weakest
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.700]   and the smallest faith.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   What's that? It's this.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:32.700]   However poor and however small and however unapplied
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.700]   the faith of these disciples was on this occasion,
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.700]   they at any rate had the right amount of faith to make them do the right thing.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.700]   In the end, they go to him.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.700]   Having been agitated and desperate and alarmed and excited,
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   they go to him.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.700]   They're all bewildered, but they go to him.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.700]   They still have got some kind of feeling that he can do something about it at any rate.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.700]   So they awaken him. They say, "Master, aren't you doing something about it?"
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   "It's all right."
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   That is very poor faith, very weak faith, but it's faith, thank God.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:18.700]   And you see, even a faith like a grain of mustard seed is all right because it takes us to him.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.700]   And when you do go to him, this is what you'll find.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.700]   He will be disappointed in you, and he won't conceal that.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.700]   He'll rebuke you.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   He'll say, "Where was your faith?"
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.700]   He'll say, "Why didn't you reason it out?
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.700]   Why didn't you apply your faith?
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.700]   Why did you appear agitated like that before that worldly person?
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   Why did you behave as if you were not a Christian at all and had no faith?
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.700]   Why didn't you apply your faith? Where was your faith?
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   You should have been, and I would have been so pleased
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:58.700]   if I could have watched you standing like a man in the midst of the hurricane and the storm.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.700]   Oh, why didn't you?"
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:08.700]   He'll let us know that he's disappointed in us, and he'll rebuke us.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:16.700]   But blessed be his name, he'll nevertheless still receive us.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   He doesn't drive us away. He didn't drive these men away.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   He receives them. He receives us.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.700]   Yes, he'll not only receive us, he'll bless us.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.700]   He'll even give us peace.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.700]   Oh, he rebuked them. He got up and he rebuked the wind and the sea,
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.700]   and there was a great calm.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:43.700]   He produced the conditions they were so anxious to have in spite of their faith.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:50.700]   Such is the gracious Lord that you and I trust in and believe in and follow.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.700]   Though he is disappointed in us often and though he rebukes us,
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.700]   he'll never reject us.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.700]   He'll receive us. He'll bless us.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   He'll give us peace, and indeed he'll probably do with us what he did with these people.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.700]   He gave them a still greater conception of himself than he'd ever done before.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:15.700]   They were full of marvel and amazement at his wonderful power.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   He, as it were, threw something into the bargain on top of all the blessings.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:27.700]   Very well, then, I close by putting it like this.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:32.700]   If you find yourself in this position of trial and of trouble and of testimony,
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   take it as a wonderful opportunity of proving your faith,
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.700]   of showing your faith, of manifesting your faith,
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.700]   and bringing glory to his great and holy name.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.700]   But if you should fail to do that,
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.700]   if you should apparently be too weak to do it,
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.700]   if you're being so besieged and attacked by the devil and by hell
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.700]   and by the world let loose against you,
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.700]   and you feel you can't and in your helplessness,
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.700]   well, then I say this, fly to him at once,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.700]   and he'll receive you, and he'll bless you.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:15.700]   He'll give you deliverance. He'll give you peace.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   Faith is an activity. It is something that has to be applied.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.700]   Where is your faith?
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:28.700]   Let us make certain that it is always at the place
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:34.700]   and at the point of need and of testing. Amen.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:39.700]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
