[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.560]   found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians in the first chapter and
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:19.080]   reading verses 14 and 20. Verses 14 and 20 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.960]   to the Colossians, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.820]   forgiveness of sins, and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.880]   him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him, I say, whether they be things in
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.120]   earth or things in heaven." Now I put those two verses together because they
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.480]   in reality both say the same thing. The statement of verse 14 is elaborated and
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   put a little more plainly and clearly in the 20th verse, but they're both making
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.520]   precisely the same statement. And as those who worship here regularly on
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.440]   Sunday evenings will recall, both of them are part of a complete whole in
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.360]   which the Apostle is making a very grand and great statement with respect to the
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.600]   content and the purpose of the Christian gospel. Now we are looking into this
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.280]   because it does seem to me more and more that this is the greatest need in the
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.600]   world at this present hour. Amidst all its troubles and confusions, this is the
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.920]   only hope. And there is nothing so tragic as the fact that there should be such
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.520]   confusion and uncertainty in the minds of men and women as to what this gospel
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.280]   really is. Now the thing is tragic, I say, for this reason, that our happiness not
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.640]   only in this world but in the world to come depends entirely upon our
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.400]   relationship to this message. That is the fundamental message of the whole of the
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.200]   Bible, that our fate in time and in eternity is determined by our
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.720]   relationship to God. And there is only one way in which that could be can be
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.960]   put right. It is by believing this gospel. What can be more urgently important
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.000]   therefore than that we should be absolutely clear and certain in our
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.680]   minds as to what it is. Now there's all this confusion. There's nothing new about
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.640]   that. There's always been confusion about the gospel. And there's no difficulty
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.960]   about saying why that is. We were looking at that a fortnight ago when we were
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.480]   dealing with the twelfth verse, in which, in the thirteenth verse, which tells us
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.280]   that we have been delivered from the power of darkness and been translated
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   into the kingdom of God's dear Son. The power of darkness causes the confusion.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.040]   The power of the darkness, the power of the devil and of hell, is opposed to God.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.880]   And its great ambition is to ruin God's perfect creation, which means to ruin men
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.160]   and women. And so the devil throughout the centuries has done his utmost to
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.240]   confuse people with respect to the real character of the Christian gospel.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.880]   There's nothing new in this. We mustn't think that all these new ideas and
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.240]   heresies are anything new. There isn't a single cult or heresy in a sense in the
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.680]   world tonight, but that its counterpart is to be found somewhere in the New
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.720]   Testament, every one of them. They change their form, they change their names, even
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.040]   as you've noticed that some of the cults continue to change their names even
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.720]   within our own living memory. They have to do something to try to appear to be
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.120]   new, so they go on changing their names. They're called one thing at one time,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.800]   they're called something quite different the next time, but they're the same
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.520]   people, the same thing. Well now, it's always been here, I say. And the
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   preaching, the purpose of the preaching of the gospel therefore is to make plain
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.080]   and clear as to what this gospel really is. And the Apostle does that here. And he
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.160]   does it here because he wanted to help these people in Colossae, because they
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.420]   were tending to be confused, some of them, by these false teachers that were
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.360]   already beginning to appear, even within a few years after the death of the Son of
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   God and his return to heaven. So that here, the Apostle might very well be
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.940]   writing to us tonight, and to our modern world. What does he say? Well, you remember
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.760]   he puts it like this, "The test of whether we are Christians or not is just this one
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.120]   big thing." It's in the twelfth verse, "Giving thanks unto the Father which hath
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.800]   made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light."
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   That's the test. What decides this evening, at this moment, whether I'm a
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.640]   Christian or not is this. Not the life I'm living, not the good I may be doing,
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.680]   not my ideas on a variety of subjects. It's simply this. Do I say at this moment,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:10.360]   "I am what I am by the grace of God"? Do I give thanks to the Father? Is there in my
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.880]   heart a profound sense that I owe everything to Almighty God, who has made
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.680]   me meet and fit and qualified to be a partaker of the inheritance of the
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.860]   saints in light? Now, that's the fundamental proposition which the
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.400]   Apostle works out in this paragraph that we're looking at, because he goes on to
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   tell us what was necessary before God could do this. That's what he's done. He
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.400]   has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Yes,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.040]   but it's only as we realize what that involved that we shall thank him as we
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.480]   ought. Do we think salvation is an easy thing? Do we think that salvation is a
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.920]   simple thing? Well, if we do, we are certainly not thanking God. The
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.960]   salvation of a soul is the most difficult thing in the universe, much
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.520]   more difficult than creating the world. In the creation of the world, God had
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.200]   but to say, "Let there be light," and there was light. He couldn't save a single soul
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.600]   by just saying so. Tremendous things have to happen before a soul can be saved, and
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   the Apostle tells us here what they are. Now, we've already looked at some of them.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.880]   Here they are. We need, as the 13th verse has reminded us, to be delivered from the
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:36.000]   power of darkness, because that's where we all are by nature. We are all born the
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   slaves of sin and the slaves of the devil. The power of darkness has got the
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.840]   world in its grip. As the Apostle John puts it, "The whole world lieth in the
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.720]   grip, in the embrace, in the bosom of the evil one." And that's where the world is
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   at this moment, and that's the explanation of what so many have been
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.000]   reading in the Sunday newspapers, particularly the most salacious ones.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.800]   That's the explanation of it all. The world is in the grip of the power of
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.600]   darkness. We need to be set free from it. And you see, education can't do it,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.320]   learning can't do it. You can have been to Oxford and Cambridge, and you can still
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.120]   come out in the grip of the power of darkness. You will, unless you've become a
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.760]   Christian. Nothing can touch this, but this gospel. There's a part of the test.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.480]   What else? Well, we were looking at it last Sunday night. The Apostle reminds us
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   of this, that we at one time, before we became Christians, were alienated and
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.600]   enemies in our mind by wicked works. That was our condition, estranged from God,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.000]   hating God, at enmity with God, and as the result, living a wicked and an evil life.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.040]   That's got to be overcome. Before a man can enjoy the blessings of the
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.600]   inheritance of light, the inheritance of the saints in light, a man's got to
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.840]   undergo a tremendous change. I've often put it like this. Look at it like this
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:14.120]   for a moment. How do you think you'd enjoy being in heaven? Because in heaven
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.400]   they spend their time in praising God. That seems to be the chief occupation,
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.720]   singing the praises of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. They've got none of
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.640]   the things that people live by in this world. They're not there. Nothing unclean
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.440]   enters into heaven, nothing at all. No gossip, no scandal, none of the things
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.040]   that are defacing the life of the world at the present time, they're not admitted
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.360]   there. So you see, when you look at it like that, you begin to see the problem.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.520]   God had to make us meet. He has to make us fit. He has to make us qualified to be
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.420]   the inheritors of the saints in light, and he's got to change our natures. Light
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:02.200]   and darkness are not compatible. They're antagonists, they're opposed, complete
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.240]   antitheses. So that before any one of us can ever hope to enjoy this inheritance,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.620]   we've got to be thoroughly changed. We need a new birth. Very well, there's
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.840]   another part of the problem, and we've been looking at that. But tonight, you see,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.920]   we come to another aspect of it. And in many ways this is the most tremendous
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.600]   aspect of the whole matter. So far we've been looking at what needs to be done to
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.080]   man. Man's in the grip of the devil. Man's nature is twisted, and he's an enemy and
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.280]   an alien, and he's a God-hater. He needs this newness. But all that's been about
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.320]   men. That's what's got to be done to me before I can share this inheritance. But
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.080]   you know, that says nothing. When you begin to look at this other aspect of
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   the problem that comes before us in these two verses tonight, well, what's
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.920]   that, says somebody? Oh, this is the Godward side of the problem. Because
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.040]   there are two sides to this problem. And if we would realize what God has done
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.520]   for us, we've got to look at the problem from the side of God, as well as from the
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.420]   side of man. But of course this is what the world forgets. The world never thinks
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:19.520]   of God. Most people think of religion entirely in terms of themselves. What's
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.280]   God? Well, God to most people is just some sort of agency, out of which we can get
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.520]   any blessing that we may happen to stand in need of. Isn't that the common
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.760]   conception of God? Don't we take it for granted that the moment we need anything
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.880]   we just go and apply? There it is. God becomes some kind of machine. And all we
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.440]   do is to draw from the machine. No difficulty, no problem. Whether we've
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.680]   thought of God for months or for years doesn't matter. If we are in trouble we
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.400]   pray to God and we expect an answer. And we are ready to complain if we don't get
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.760]   it. Isn't that true? We are taken ill. Turn to God, ask him to heal us. Whatever it
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.080]   is, we're always turning to God in our extremities. And God becomes just some
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.560]   impersonal agency, out of which we can draw blessings, as if he were drawing
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.400]   something out of a machine. Isn't that the common idea of God? I'm quite
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.800]   certain it is. We're all guilty of it. We are still guilty of it. The trouble with
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   everybody in this building at this moment, myself included, is that we haven't
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:27.080]   an adequate idea of God. I remember reading a book by a man some 30 years
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.060]   ago with a most arresting title, and he proved his thesis to the very hilt. The
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:38.320]   title of the book was "Religion without God." And so much of our religion is
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.560]   without God altogether. It's something nice and comforting. Men describe prayer
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   as a sort of spiritual exercise that makes us feel better, or transference of
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.560]   thought to one another. We send healing thoughts from ourselves to others. That's
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.280]   their view of prayer. God doesn't come into it at all. We can be busy with
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.720]   religion, active in church work. God doesn't come into it at all. We are
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.480]   thinking of ourselves from beginning to end, and the whole world is doing this.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.360]   Indeed, it would be a very simple thing for me to prove this evening, that all
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.600]   the troubles in the world at this present moment are really due to our
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.840]   forgetfulness of God. That's why the world is as it is, because it has
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.760]   forgotten God. Why do the nation set themselves up and the rival powers? It's
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.520]   because both of them don't realize that they're but as grasshoppers in the sight
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.600]   of God. They think they're great and mighty, and they boast of their might. Do
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.880]   you know what they are in the sight of God? Well, Isaiah tells you in chapter 40,
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.360]   "Like the small dust of the balance, or like a drop in a bucket, your great
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:52.680]   empires." But it's because they forget God they inflate themselves. Like Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.520]   Alexander the Great, all these men, the might of Rome, and every other power, our
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.160]   own included, it's been all due to the failure to realize that God is over all,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.280]   and that in his presence and in his sight we are but as nothing. We assume it's our
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.640]   world, and that we are to run it as we think and as we please, and that we are
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.720]   ever to enjoy it going our own way. But it can't be done, my dear friend. Every
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.440]   individual who's in trouble tonight is in trouble ultimately because he or she
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:33.240]   has forgotten God. We're always forgetting him. How can I get this? How
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.160]   can I improve my lot? How can society be made happier? How can we get world peace?
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.240]   You see, it starts with men, it ends with men. It starts with this life, it starts
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.720]   with this world, it ends with it. And we go on as if, well, the problem is entirely
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:55.320]   human. And God is never mentioned at all. Ah, but that's the whole trouble. That is
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:04.720]   the whole trouble for this reason, that men's well-being is entirely dependent
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.920]   upon the blessing of God. Now that's the great message of the Bible, from
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:17.480]   beginning to end, that everything about us ultimately depends upon our
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.280]   relationship to God. So we must start with God, not end with him. We start with
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.680]   him and consider everything in the light of God. Let me put it then simply like
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.760]   this. Here the Apostle says that the Christian is a man who gives thanks unto
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.520]   God the Father because God has made him meet to be a partaker of the inheritance
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.320]   of the saints in light. What is that inheritance? What's the essence of it?
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.320]   It's this, that you are a person who is blessed by God in this life and in this
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:55.120]   world. That's the blessing, that's the inheritance, that you begin to become a
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.480]   companion of God, that God begins to smile upon you and to bless you. And then
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.080]   of course, ultimately in eternity and in the glory, what is it? Well, it is to see
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.200]   God and to enjoy him forever. Now that hymn we've just been singing, the hymn of
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   Isaac Watts, puts it very well, doesn't it? "The men of faith have found glory begun
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:28.960]   below. Celestial fruits on earthly ground from faith and hope can grow." He says, "Even
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.640]   while we are walking through this world, there are things, there are blessings
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.600]   which we can receive and which we can enjoy before," he says, "we reach the
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:45.120]   heavenly fields or walk the golden streets." So I'm saying that this
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.840]   inheritance of the saints in light of which the Christians become partakers
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.160]   are these blessings of God that we begin to enjoy while we are still in this
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:02.120]   world and which we are going to enjoy unmixed and in all their fullness when
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   we pass through the portals of death and go on into the life and into the world
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:15.320]   beyond. Well, very well. If we realize that that is the essence of the inheritance of
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.520]   the saints in light, namely to enjoy God, the question that arises at once is this,
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:28.560]   "How can this ever come to pass?" Now here's the very question that we are looking at
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:35.720]   together this evening. How can I ever get into that relationship with God in which
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.920]   I enjoy him and enjoy the blessings that he has to give me? Now the apostle, you
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.520]   see, puts it like this. He says, "Here's a great problem, and the problem is not
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.160]   merely and only that we by nature are the slaves of the devil and the powers
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.800]   of darkness. It is not merely that our natures are twisted and perverted and
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.400]   that we are enemies and aliens of God by wicked works. It is that, but it isn't
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:09.520]   only that." Well, what else is that? Well, the other aspect of the problem is this.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.680]   How can this ever happen, not only because I am what I am, but because God
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.280]   is what he is? Now then, have you ever thought of that? Have you ever considered
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.840]   that for a moment? That's the very question that the apostle puts before us.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:31.240]   What does it mean? Well, let me summarize it by putting it like this. What God has
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:40.040]   done for us and what leads us to thank him can only rarely be appreciated as we
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.920]   look at this whole problem from the standpoint and the aspect of God himself.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:54.080]   Now then, what do you mean, Sir? Well, I mean this. Man, I say, depends upon God
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.760]   and his blessing. That's this inheritance. But what's the problem, Sir? Well,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:08.600]   it is the character of God himself. What is the character of God? Well, we are told
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.880]   various things about this in the scriptures. The first great attribute, the
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:18.640]   great characteristic of God is his glory. What is glory? Well, it's something that
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:26.120]   cannot be described. It's so great. It is God's essential being. He's a glorious God.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.720]   Glory. But then he's described as light. These are the terms that are used to
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.960]   give us some glimmering understanding of the nature and the being of God. Come, my
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.520]   friends, how often have you considered this? When you say so glibly in your
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.840]   argument, "Why does God allow this? Why doesn't God do that?" Do you realize about
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:54.720]   whom you're speaking? Listen, God is light and in him is no darkness at all. None.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.560]   That's just a figure to give us some impression of the being and the glory of
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.240]   God. Then God has told us that he is holy. What does that mean? Well, holiness, of
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.480]   course, is the exact opposite of sin. Holiness is to be entirely apart from
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.440]   evil. Holiness is a dazzling whiteness without a speck, without
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.160]   anything wrong. There's nothing unworthy, there's nothing twisted, there's nothing
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.000]   unclean. Holiness is again light, if you like, an absolute purity without any
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.280]   suspicion of an admixture of anything else. God is holy. He's eternally removed
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:45.680]   from sin and evil. What else? Well, God is a God of truth. God is truth. In other
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.600]   words, there is nothing which carries any notion of a lie or anything that is
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.120]   not strictly true in God. God is everlasting truth. There is no
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.080]   contradiction, there's no modification, there isn't even any qualification. He is
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:08.360]   the truth. What else have we told? Well, we are told that God is just, that God is
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:15.240]   righteous, that God abominates anything which has a twist in it, anything which
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.200]   has any sham or pretense or mere appearance of make-believe. God is
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.360]   utterly opposed to that. God is entirely removed from it. God is everlastingly
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.920]   different from it. God is just and righteous. And then another attribute of
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.960]   God that is emphasized always in the Bible is this, that he's unchangeable.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.520]   Difficult for us to think of that, isn't it? We are so changeable, and everything
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.320]   we know is so changeable, but God, we are told, is unchangeable. He is the Father of
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:52.760]   Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow cast by turning. God is
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.440]   everlastingly the same. He cannot change, because he is absolutely perfect in
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.200]   every respect, and you can't change that. He always is. So he speaks to the nation
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   and he says, "I am that I am." That includes the notion, "I am what I am, I
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.560]   become what I become. I am from eternity to eternity, and I am always and
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   everlastingly the same." The unchangeable God. Now, I leave it just as that, but
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.160]   remember then that we are dealing with such a being. Those are the
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:41.480]   characteristics and the attributes of God. Very well. God created men. That's how
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.960]   we come in, that's where we come in. He was everlastingly, and he could live
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.240]   without us. He didn't need us. He's not dependent upon us, but he chose and he
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.580]   decided to create men and to create the world. Why did he do that? See, this is the
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.560]   way to approach the problem. Why did God ever create men? Well, the answer is he
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:04.840]   created him for his own glory. He created him for his own pleasure. Why? Well, he
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.400]   created men in order that men might be his representative here in this world
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:15.800]   and on this earth. He made him the Lord of creation. He made him supreme over all
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.560]   the animals. He gave him the privilege of naming them. He was to look after them,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.640]   and everything was here to serve men. Man was to be a kind of reflection of God.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.160]   Man was to be God's representative here in this created universe, and he's a very
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.120]   special being, therefore. He was made in the image of God. Nothing else was. All
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.960]   the animals were created, the flowers and the plants and so on, but man, man is made
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:45.440]   in the image of God. He's like God. He's got a mind. He's got reason. He can think
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.200]   of himself objectively. He can look at himself and meditate about himself.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.720]   That's a part of men's image, the image that he's received from God. And God made
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.680]   him like that, and that was his object, that man might be here and, as it were, run
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:06.200]   the universe for him. Always see that it was to his glory and to his praise. God
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.760]   did all this out of his own good pleasure and for his own glory, and he
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:19.160]   puts men here in the central position. Very well. Having made men like this in
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.680]   his own image and having endowed him with these special and exceptional
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.700]   faculties, God made certain demands of men. He said, "Now you are my
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:34.360]   representative, and I want you to live as such. There'll be a danger, of course, in
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.440]   this exalted position that I put you, that you may think it's your world and
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.920]   your universe, and you may try to set yourself up as a God. Very well," he said.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   "I put you, therefore, into this position. You can do almost anything you like." But
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.800]   that was God's way of securing that men would always be subject to God and
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.440]   always be God's representative, and not his own master, as it were, not his own
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.320]   God. So he put him there, as it were, on probation in that way, and he made those
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:09.520]   demands of him. That always and in all things he should minister to God's glory,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.740]   that he should always be God's servant, that he shouldn't become a rebel and set
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.480]   up a rival kingdom or try to steal from God this position he'd been put into. No,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.920]   no, he was to go on as God's representative amongst all the creatures
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   of the universe and here in this world and on this earth. God made that
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:35.040]   perfectly plain to him. And in many other places and in many other ways, God has
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.760]   made quite plain to men what he demands of him and what he expects of him. Take
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.480]   the Ten Commandments, for instance. People joke about them, don't they? They make
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:49.160]   films of them now. They do everything but keep them. What are the Ten
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:58.240]   Commandments? Well, you start with God. "No other God beside me." You don't make any
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.840]   graven image, you don't take his name in vain, you don't take his day in vain. God!
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.080]   You live for him. Why? Well, because he's made you, because you're his
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.040]   representative, because you've got something of him in you. Very well, you
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.800]   live for him, to glory him amongst all who are around and about you. And you
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.600]   carry it out in detail. Not kill, not steal, not commit adultery and so on.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.680]   These are but the marks of man made in the image of God. That's what I want from
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.200]   you, says God. He puts men in that position and says, "Now then, go on, live
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:36.520]   like that. Show my glory. Be the Lord of creation." What a tremendous position. Well,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:43.520]   the next step is this. Men to whom God had done all that and to whom God had
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.760]   given such a wonderful privilege, men did the very exact opposite of everything
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.280]   that I've been saying. He listened to the suggestion which said to him, "Look here,
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.800]   this kingdom can be yours. You needn't go on being the servant of God. Why not take
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.240]   it yourself? Why not really become Lord of creation? You're only in a secondary
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.320]   position. Now why not go to the top? Here's your chance. Take it, men." And man
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.120]   said, "Right," and he did it. But then you remember that meant rebellion. That meant
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.840]   breaking God's commandments and so on. But now this has got to be viewed not
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:24.080]   merely from the standpoint of man. We've already seen what it's done to men. Man, by
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.360]   rebelling against God and by sinning, made himself the slave of darkness and
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.280]   of the devil. His nature became twisted and perverted. He became a creature of
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   lust and he became afraid and he runs to hide from God. He became an unhappy being
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.680]   and he's been unhappy ever since. But you know that isn't the main trouble. That's
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.880]   bad enough, isn't it? But that isn't the biggest trouble that you and I have, my
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.360]   friends. I know, we all know that life is miserable and unhappy. That we all of us
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.680]   know remorse and useless remorse and so on. And we know all the strains of life.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.440]   We've brought it all upon ourselves, but that's not our main problem. What is our
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.720]   main problem? Well, I'll tell you. The main problem arises when you begin to
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:14.360]   consider what God thinks of all this. Here's the trouble. Now God has told us
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.920]   very plainly what he does think of it. He told men when he put him there in
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.720]   probation, on probation, in the Garden of Eden, he said, "Look here, if you break
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:32.280]   this rule, this law, you will die and you will be thrust out of the Garden of
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:38.680]   Paradise and you will bring misery upon yourself." And it all happened. Now God was
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.800]   just indicating there what he thinks of evil and rebellion and sin and
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:50.120]   transgression of his law. And he went on revealing it as the years and the
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:58.520]   centuries passed. And what he has revealed is this. God hates sin. He's bound to. I say
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.920]   it with reverence. He wouldn't be God if he didn't. God is light and in him is no
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.720]   darkness at all. How can he like the darkness? How can he like the works of
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.640]   the devil? How can he like the lust and the passion? God hates it. He's the
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.960]   eternal antithesis to it. And he's told us that he hates it with all the intensity
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.360]   of his divine being. He's made this quite clear. He did it, I say again, in the Ten
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.880]   Commandments. He's done it in many other ways. The chief way that you see in the
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.240]   Old Testament, apart from the Ten Commandments, is this. You see what God
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   has done to individuals who sinned against him. Doesn't matter who they were.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.200]   Even they might be favorites like David. When they sin, they suffer. God always
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.480]   punishes sin. He said he would. He always has. He said, "The soul that sinneth, it
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:55.800]   shall die." And it does die. Very well, you see, what I'm trying to establish is that
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.680]   all this is inevitable because of the being and the character and the
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:08.920]   nature of God. Well now then, here is the position at which we arrive. Because of
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   man's rebellion and sin and fall, he is in this position. That he is guilty and
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:23.800]   condemned before God's law. Now this is a new way of looking at it, isn't it? Oh, I
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.760]   spent a Sunday evening with you in working it out in terms of his slavery
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:33.520]   and his serfdom to the devil. We spent another Sunday evening in working it out
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:41.640]   in terms of what it's done to men's own internal being and nature. But here is
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.400]   the big and the great and the momentous thing that every one of us is guilty
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:53.880]   before God's holy law. Condemned. You see, it's not a matter of how we feel. It's not
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.720]   a matter of what we do, nor what we are. That doesn't matter here. The question is
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:07.400]   that we are confronted by God's holy law. Which he's given and which he has stated
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.520]   quite plainly and quite clearly. And there we, every one of us, are face to
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:18.800]   face with this holy law of God. Everybody, doesn't matter who we are, whether you're
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.160]   moral or immoral, whether you're a good or a bad person so-called, whatever your
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.880]   color, whatever your continent, doesn't matter. All have sinned and come short of
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:34.200]   the glory of God. The whole world lies guilty before God. We are under the
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.960]   condemnation of God. Have you ever considered that? You say, "What I want is
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.280]   I want guidance or I want healing. I want to live a happy life." My dear friend, all
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.080]   right, but before you ask for any one of those things, you better consider this.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:56.440]   How do you stand before God's law? Oh, the analogy is obvious. If you break one of
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.400]   the laws of England, that's the only thing that matters at that point. You go
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.520]   to court, the charge is read out against you. If you begin to say, "Yes, but look here,
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.040]   this is my position in life. I hold a very exalted position. I'm the most
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.280]   important person. I'm doing a lot of good. I'm giving a lot of money to good
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:18.960]   causes." They'll say, "Look here, you have broken Act so-and-so, Regulation Number
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.560]   Subsection." There it is. And you've got to abide by the consequences. Well, now
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.000]   multiply that by infinity, and there is every one of us standing before the law
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.400]   of a holy God. Every one of us. This is the problem, that we are guilty and
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.120]   condemned by the law of God. Not only that, we are under the wrath of God.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.360]   Now, this isn't my idea. This is something that God himself has revealed. It means
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:32:01.240]   this, we are under his displeasure. God is, God is personal, God isn't a machine. God
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:08.000]   is one whom we address as "Thou," and he knows us individually. And the tragedy of
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.280]   our position is that we are under the wrath of God. That means this, when he
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.880]   first made men, he looked at him and he was well pleased in him, and he smiled
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.480]   upon him and he blessed him. But the moment men sinned, the relationship was
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.640]   interfered with and upset, and God couldn't look with pleasure upon men, the
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.560]   men he'd made in his own image. There he is, skulking and hiding behind the trees,
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:38.000]   the fool. Does God rejoice in that? Of course he doesn't. God hates that. God's
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.400]   displeasure is upon sin, his wrath is upon sin. And again, I would remind you
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.080]   of how that comes out in the Scriptures. The Jews, the children of Israel, were
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:58.280]   God's own people. But because of their persistent rebellion and disobedience, it
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.160]   was he himself who raised up the enemy, the Chaldeans, to conquer Jerusalem and
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.440]   the country and to carry them away captive to Babylon. God did that. He was
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.760]   displeased with his people, and he told them so. You see, I'm arguing, my dear
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.280]   friends, and God forgive me if I'm putting it in too familiar a manner. God
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.880]   can't help being like this. He can't help doing it, because he is light and in him
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.200]   is no darkness at all, and he's just and righteous and unchangeable and altogether
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:30.040]   holy and pure. And this other thing that you and I are, he hates it, and his wrath
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:36.880]   is upon it. The Bible's full of this. You'll find there in the first chapter of
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:43.400]   Paul's epistle to the Romans, from 18 verse 18 onwards, that there it's put
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.800]   like this, that God sometimes shows his wrath upon sin, well, by just allowing us
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.640]   to get on with it. He just abandons us. He gives us over to a reprobate mind. The
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.200]   Apostle's argument is this. He says, "When the world didn't believe in God, but
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.760]   began to believe in itself and its own wisdom, God abandoned them." And what was
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.560]   the result of that? Well, they began to worship the creature rather than the
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.000]   Creator. Men began to have passion towards men, women towards women. They
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.840]   became unnatural. The horrible perversions came in. Did you know that
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:23.240]   that is a part of the wrath of God upon sin? When God ceases to restrain evil in
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.320]   this world, that's the sort of thing you get, and it's a part of God's punishment
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.360]   of sin. I think the modern world is experiencing the wrath of God. I've said
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.160]   it before, I say it again. To me there is only one explanation of the two world
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:42.280]   wars we've had in this present century. It's just this. This country and Germany
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.120]   and other countries now for a hundred years have been saying that they don't
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.960]   need God. It began in Germany, of course, with their philosophy and their science.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.480]   We borrowed it here as we are ever ready to borrow the worst in every nation. We
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.200]   took it up from Germany and we began to believe the same thing. The whole world
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:04.880]   said it didn't need God. Very well, said God. If you say you can get on without me,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:11.000]   get on without me. And what happens? Well, you get these horrible world wars and
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.800]   worse things are coming. And all that is nothing but a part of the manifestation
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.960]   of the wrath of God upon sin. He's showing his hatred of it. He says, "There you are.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.760]   Reap the consequences of what you do and what you believe. I'll let you reap it."
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.440]   And there we are in agony and suffering and the tension of the modern world and
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.160]   the fear. It's all a part of God's wrath upon sin. It's the second consequence.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.080]   What's the third? Well, it is that there is a state of enmity between man and God.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.640]   Man was meant to be the companion of God. He made him for that reason. The chief
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:50.480]   end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.760]   God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.480]   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." That's how man was meant to be. At peace
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.280]   with God, enjoying the companionship of God. But sin has done away with it. There's
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:09.240]   warfare. There's a lack of peace. There's enmity. And God hates all this in men so
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:15.400]   that there is enmity between God and men. Now then, here it is. Here's the problem.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:25.440]   Have you ever looked at it like this, I wonder? How can God remain God? How can
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:33.960]   God be true to himself and remain the unchangeable God that he is? And have any
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   dealings at all with man as he is in sin? Have you ever considered this? Here is
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.400]   the third great problem of salvation. Made us meet to be partakers of the
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:54.760]   inheritance of the saints in light. How can it possibly be the case? Not only is
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:01.320]   man in the grip of the power of darkness and a slave, not only is his nature vile
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.560]   and rotten, all that prevents his being an inheritor of the saints in light, but
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:11.240]   look at this. To be an inheritor of the saints in light, I say, means to have
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:19.320]   companionship with God, to know God and to enjoy him. But how can God do it? How
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.240]   can God possibly have dealings with us? What of his righteousness? What of his
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.840]   justice? What of his holiness? What of his character? What of his unchangeableness?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.000]   Have you ever considered that? Have you ever considered the problem from God's
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.440]   side? That's what's put before us here. "Oh, but sir, somebody, there's no
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.960]   difficulty at all. You've just been very clever tonight, you see," says somebody.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.040]   "You stopped in your enumeration of the attributes of God. I didn't hear you
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.480]   saying a word about the fact that God is love. You were very careful not to say
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.520]   that. You were equally careful not to mention his mercy, nor his compassion.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.640]   You're making an artificial problem," says somebody. "There is no problem. All you're
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.080]   saying about men is perfectly true. But God is love, and because God is love
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.560]   there's no problem. Love means, well, that you don't see things as they are. You just
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.200]   pour out your benevolence on everybody. Doesn't matter what a man is, you just
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:21.240]   shower your love upon him. God is love." But my dear friend, I agree with you that God
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.800]   is love, and I wouldn't be in this pulpit if he wasn't. But you see, the way you
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.480]   shout "God is love" means that you don't know what love is. Your love is a love
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.400]   that contradicts truth. It's a love that contradicts righteousness. It is a love
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.440]   that contradicts justice. It is a love that contradicts holiness. It is a love
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:45.260]   that is dark and not light. It is a love that lacks glory. No, no, here is the
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:54.680]   problem. How can God reconcile his love with his holiness? How can he reconcile
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:39:02.640]   his truth with his mercy? How can he reconcile his justice with his compassion?
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.920]   Oh, let me put it in the words again used by the Apostle Paul in the epistle to
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:16.400]   the Romans in chapter 3 in verses 25 and 26. Here's the problem. How can God remain
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:26.480]   just and forgive anybody? Forgiveness is not easy for God, because God hates sin,
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.560]   because God has said that "the soul that sinneth it shall die," and God is
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.640]   unchangeable, and his just and everything he said must be carried out. He can't
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.240]   modify it. He can't take it back. He can't pretend he hasn't said it. He can't wink.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.440]   He can't turn his back. God has no back. God is everlastingly right, righteousness,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:50.880]   holiness, justice, purity. All are absolute. Oh, is there no way of solving this
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:57.080]   problem? How can this holy God ever look upon me, leave alone, have dealings with
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.400]   me, leave alone, make me a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light?
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.880]   That's the question. Had you considered the problem before? Had you thought this
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.600]   was simply quite easy? You just say God's love and there's no problem. He doesn't
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.680]   see it. He pretends he hasn't. No, no, it's inconceivable in God. He wouldn't be
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.520]   God. He'd go back on himself. He'd deny some of his own essential attributes. Oh,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:25.620]   here's the question of the reconciliation of God with God. And the
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.160]   answer of the gospel is just this. And it's the message that's before us. It is
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:37.720]   the message of Christmas. It is the message of the Incarnation. God himself
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:45.920]   has solved the problem and he has provided the way. Nobody else could. Man
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.800]   can't. He's the slave of the devil. His nature is perverted and twisted and vile.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:57.120]   And in any case, he can't change God. God alone can do it and God has done it. Have
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.040]   you noticed this? Giving thanks unto the Father who has made us meet to be the
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.960]   partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Who he has delivered us
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.720]   from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   dear Son. And here it is in this verse we are looking at. He, God, having made peace
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:19.000]   through the blood of his cross by him, Christ, to reconcile all things unto
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.760]   himself. By him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, all
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.480]   things by him. Oh, here's the message my dear friend and this is why you should
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:36.040]   praise God. It's God himself who solved the problem. God and nobody else. John 3
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:43.320]   16. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.280]   believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Have you realized
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.400]   this? It's God's solution. What Christianity preaches is not that we are
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.240]   to pull ourselves up to live a better life, to try to do this and that. We can't.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.120]   We are hopeless. We are helpless. It's God who's done it. It began in the mind of God.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.360]   He's put it into practice and he sent his only Son into this world. That's the
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.880]   great message that's here before us. But oh, I'm anxious that we should see it
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:18.120]   from the side of God. Do you see the problem there? God's love says, "I want to
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.320]   forgive men." God's mercy said, "I must. I see him in trouble. I see men happy. I must
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.920]   do something." God's compassion agreed. But God's justice said, "You made him in your
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.600]   own image. You gave him a perfect chance. You told him exactly what would happen
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.760]   and he broke it and he did it deliberately. You said you'd punish him.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.800]   You must." And here is it, as it were, a great argument between love and justice,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.600]   between mercy and truth. How can these things be reconciled? There they are,
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.840]   mercy and truth, righteousness and peace. And they're opposing. And yet they're all
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.640]   in the being and the character of God. And this is the wonderful message of
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.720]   Christmas. This is the glory of the Advent. This is the thrill of the New Testament
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:09.040]   gospel. That God himself has found a way out. How? Oh, by sending his only Son from
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.760]   heaven into this world. And by making him under a woman and under the law.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.760]   And enabling him to live a perfect life by putting him on the cross on Calvary
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.240]   and smiting him with his own wrath. That you and I might be forgiven and that God
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.720]   might still be just and able to forgive us. That's how he solved it. But here are
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:36.560]   the great terms that are used. In whom we have redemption. Through his blood even
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:43.280]   the forgiveness of sins. What's it mean? Oh, here's the message that in Christ God
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.640]   has found a way whereby we can be delivered from the curse and the
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:53.960]   condemnation of the law. This is the way that God forgives us. It's the only way.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:44:00.600]   He says as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:07.880]   transgressions from us. That's what he's done. Did you notice it in Romans 5? God
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:16.280]   commended his love toward us. In that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:23.960]   for us. While we were yet without due strength, in due time Christ died for us.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.680]   It's God who's done it and he commends his love to us. In that while we were
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.480]   without strength, while we were sinners, while we were enemies and alienated and
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:39.320]   utterly in the grip of the devil, Christ died for us and God in him hath
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.440]   reconciled us unto himself. That's the second word. There it is, redeemed us in
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:50.000]   verse 14. In verse 20, and having made peace through the blood of his cross by
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.040]   him to reconcile all things unto himself and you that were sometimes alienated
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.560]   and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled. You see the
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.000]   process? The Son of God has come into the world, he's answered the demands of the
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.080]   law, the curse has been removed, the condemnation's gone, our sins are cast
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:17.040]   into the sea of God's forgetfulness. And having done that, now then he reconciles
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.480]   us unto himself. How does he do it? Well, he's free to do it. His justice, his
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.960]   righteousness, his everything is satisfied. So he now reconciles us unto
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:32.000]   himself. How does he do it? Well, 2 Corinthians 5 answered the question. God
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.800]   was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.840]   unto them. That's it, that's the message. That's the message, that's the ministry
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:51.440]   of reconciliation. God was in and through Christ and what he did in Christ,
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.480]   reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. What
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:02.720]   does that mean? It just means this. That having placed your sins and mine on
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:09.480]   Christ and having punished them there, he can now smile upon us. He puts that
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.200]   perfect life and righteousness of Christ upon us and he looks at us in that and
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.960]   he smiles upon us and he's ready to bless us once more. This is the good news.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.120]   If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. All things are passed away, all
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.480]   things become new. But you see, that can't happen until I'm forgiven. I'm
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.160]   first forgiven, then I'm given new life. I'm a new man and God makes me his son
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.720]   and looks upon me as a father and smiles upon me. God and sinners reconciled.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:45.000]   That's the glory of it all. That's the whole message of Christmas. Hark the
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.600]   herald angels sing, glory to the new-born King, peace on earth and mercy mild. God
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:47:00.280]   and sinners reconciled, brought into his favor again. He smiles upon us and so
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.240]   peace is made. Having made peace by the blood of his cross, yes, says the Paul
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:11.800]   again to the Romans, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:18.240]   Lord Jesus Christ. As an old psalmist had prophesied, in Christ mercy and truth
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.920]   are met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. The antagonists
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:29.440]   are embracing one another. Mercy and peace are all satisfied. Righteous, mercy
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.520]   and truth and righteousness and peace and all the attributes of God are
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:40.400]   perfectly harmonized and reconciled to each other. And so God is reconciled to
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:45.680]   men. And there is again peace between God and men and what's the result of that?
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:53.000]   Well it's just this, that we in this way have been made meet, made fit, made
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   qualified to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. You
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.240]   see, believing this I know that I am forgiven. I know that I've been restored
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.000]   to God's favor, not because I'm anything, but because I'm in Christ who died for
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.440]   me and purchased me and redeemed me and given me his own nature and his own
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:22.760]   righteousness. I'm in God's favor once more. The result is that I stand now in
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.520]   grace. I'm not under the condemnation of God's law. There is no condemnation.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.840]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. There
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:38.200]   was before. The law of God thunders it. The justice of God demands it. But Christ
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.760]   does the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth. And I believe
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.560]   in him. I believe he died for me. Therefore there is no condemnation for
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.200]   me. I'm in grace. I'm standing in grace and that enables me to go to God with
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:57.040]   confidence. And I can pray to God now without being afraid. I come out of my
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:02.120]   hiding places and I go to God knowing that I'm accepted, knowing that I shall
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.640]   find mercy, knowing that I shall have the grace to help in time of need. I know it
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.360]   because I'm restored to his favor. I'm not only forgiven, I made a child of God.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:17.080]   I say, "My father, Abba, Father, look upon me. Help me have mercy." And he will. He's
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:24.980]   pledged to it. He's reconciled me to himself. So now you see why a Christian
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:33.280]   gives thanks to the Father? That is what the Almighty God has done in order that
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.840]   you and I might be reconciled to him. This was a problem in which he couldn't
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.280]   say, "Let there be forgiveness." No, no. "Justice, righteousness, make that
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:55.720]   impossible." There was only one way, and the way was this, that God should send his
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:03.800]   only begotten, dearly beloved son into this evil and sinful world. Don't you
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:09.360]   sentimentalize Christmas, my friend? Don't you shed your crocodile tears
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.560]   over that babe in that manger? Don't you bring your sentimentality into this
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:19.280]   matter? This is tremendous. This is the biggest thing in the whole universe. God
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:27.600]   did that because nothing else could ever reconcile you to him. Nothing else. The
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:33.880]   love of God alone cannot solve the problem of men in sin. Love and justice,
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:39.340]   mercy and righteousness, peace and truth, all of them are involved, and all must
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:44.040]   be absolutely satisfied. And here is the only way. God thought of it. God did it.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:50.240]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. God was in Christ
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:57.160]   reconciling the world unto himself. That's what it involved. Never forget
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:04.200]   what it cost God that you and I might be saved. Stop thinking so much about
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.100]   yourself and this subjectivity, and say, "But Charlie, I'm not as bad as all that."
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:13.000]   And, "I think I ought to have a little love and mercy." My dear friend, you're
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.960]   speaking in ignorance. You don't know the character of God. The moment you realize
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.480]   the truth about God, you'll see that that's eternally impossible. God must be
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:29.680]   just. He always is, and in Christ he is. He has punished your sin in him. He
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:36.840]   therefore gives you free forgiveness and pardon. He reconciles you unto himself, in
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:44.120]   and through his only begotten beloved Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:55.560]   Now then, don't you see now why as a Christian you are bound to give all the
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:02.520]   praise and the thanksgiving unto God? If you bring in even an iota of your own
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.880]   righteousness here, you're outside. If you want to hold on to anything in
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.840]   yourself, your believing, or anything else, or your free will, I tell you, you're
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:17.880]   not a Christian. Salvation is all to gather from God. It is he who reconciles
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:25.640]   us unto himself, even at the cost of the death of his own Son. He that spared not
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:33.920]   his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. That's what he did. How shall he not
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:40.800]   also with him also freely give us all things? Are you thanking the Father? Are
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.920]   you thanking him for having solved the problem, and in such a way, in the
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.320]   humiliation, the suffering, the agony of his only Son? Have you ever thanked him?
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:55.360]   If you haven't, you're not a Christian. The Christian is a man who knows that he
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:02.760]   is what he is entirely and only by the grace of God in our Lord and Savior
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:10.080]   Jesus Christ. Look at the problem, I say, not only from your own angle, but from
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:20.560]   the angle of God, and begin to measure that little word "so" in John 3.16. God so
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:30.680]   loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:40.040]   him should not perish, he would otherwise, but have everlasting life. Have you got
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:46.320]   it? If you have, you're thanking the Father, you're praising this God who so
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   loved you, has to do that for you. Amen.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
