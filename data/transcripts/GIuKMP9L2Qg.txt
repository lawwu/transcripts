[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   How much are you thinking about what you're saying?
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.400]   I feel like sometimes it can be easy
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.200]   to just speak off the cuff.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200]   Do you have any tips for kind of restraining
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.160]   to really hone and focus when you kind of know the answer,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.400]   but if you took a minute,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.720]   you could piece together an even more profound response?
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.180]   - When you're in a situation and you're listening,
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.800]   actually make sure you're listening to the person,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.120]   not formulating your response in the moment.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.240]   I think there's a point in time, you know,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.980]   when you've kind of gotten the gist
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.280]   of what someone is saying, when you kind of turn to,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.000]   okay, now I'm like, I'm listening,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.600]   but I'm also creating the narrative
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000]   of what I'm gonna say in my mind.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.540]   But it's usually later than you think.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.200]   Most people, I think, stop listening very, very quickly
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.140]   in someone's dialogue.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.640]   Learning to like uncomfortably push that back a little bit
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.480]   and listen a little bit longer,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.600]   I find that you learn a lot more from the other person.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.800]   And then as a result,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300]   you end up coming up with more insightful responses.
