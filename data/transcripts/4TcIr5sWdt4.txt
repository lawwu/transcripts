[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   I also find it helpful to kind of like literally look up all of the health benefits of it because
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.080]   the second that you are aware of all of the massive benefits you can get in your life
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.460]   by doing something like meditating, it just becomes so much more motivated.
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.680]   And you can also do I on the focus episode of the podcast, we talked about like whether
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.960]   you could just do activities mindfully, like mindfully wash your dishes or mindfully go
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.960]   for a walk.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.000]   And that does have a certain amount of benefits, but not nearly the same benefits as that concentrated
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   dose of mindfulness of 12 minutes a day.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.840]   What she talked about interestingly is partially like training ourselves to sit in discomfort
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.800]   and training ourselves to not like the experience in a way.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800]   I like that.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   Like forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.200]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.640]   money and travel.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here for a conversation with Liz Moody.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.160]   Liz is a longtime writer, editor and healthy recipe developer.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.540]   She's the author of two cookbooks, Healthier Together and Glow Pops.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.860]   She was formerly the food director for Mind Body Green, and she's had her work featured
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.520]   in Vogue, Women's Health and many more places.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.280]   And last but certainly not least, she's the host of the hit wellness podcast, Healthier
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840]   Together, which features intimate interviews with some of the biggest names in the wellness
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.460]   world, as well as a few non-wellness guests like yours truly.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.280]   In fact, the episode I did on her show just went live today as well.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.640]   And in case you aren't watching on YouTube, we recorded both those episodes live from
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.800]   the All The Hacks studio, AKA my basement.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.340]   This conversation is going to be chocked full of all kinds of health and wellness hacks.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.160]   But if you hear that and think it might be too healthy for you, then you should definitely
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.840]   stick around because I happen to know we both share a fondness for a certain unhealthy cereal
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.520]   and that while Liz certainly believes in the power of food to heal and nourish your body,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.400]   she also knows that a good pasta carbonara has a place on the table because sometimes
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.040]   it can just heal your soul.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   We're here to talk spices, cold showers, circadian walks, meditation, vitamins, taping your mouth
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.860]   at night, hacks to make frozen veggies taste great, and a lot more.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.900]   That is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.080]   Liz, thanks for being here.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.680]   Thanks for having me in your house.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.580]   This feels very intimate and fun.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.580]   I know.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.080]   I have done almost all virtual recordings online and then two this week in person.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.440]   It feels like the new normal.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.520]   Oh, I'm so happy with it.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.440]   I love people so much and I'm an introverted extrovert or an extroverted introvert.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   I always forget which one I identify with the most, but I love being around people until
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   I absolutely don't.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.640]   And then I need to go not be around people ever again.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.840]   Yeah, I think I'm an extroverted extrovert.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.360]   So I'm going to start by letting you know that I, too, love Fruity Pebbles.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.520]   That is not where I thought you would start.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.520]   Is it your cereal of choice?
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.440]   I wouldn't go as far as cereal of choice, but it's definitely in like the top two or
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   three.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.400]   I only say not of choice because like it's not a healthy cereal.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.040]   It's not a natural cereal.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.800]   I thought the colors were like they always say eat the rainbow.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   Is that not?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   No, that's Skittle.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Also not natural.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.880]   But people are not going to listen to any of my health advice from this moment on.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.640]   Well, actually, I think the opposite, because so often I feel like you're talking to people
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.080]   who have an opinion about health and ways to eat healthier and live healthier and healthier.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.540]   And you get all of this feedback that is like you can't do anything fun.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.880]   And so I wanted to start with that, because when I was reading part of your cookbook and
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   I was just reading some of the content you wrote, I listened to some of your podcasts.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.160]   There is a lot of advice on how you can live a happier, healthier life.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   Yes.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.200]   But I also heard that you love Fruity Pebbles, which makes me feel like you're a normal person
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.840]   and you're not someone who's just like figured out how to never eat anything unhealthy, which
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.560]   I just is not an option in my world.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.960]   Like, you know, I like cinnamon rolls.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   I like donuts.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   I like Fruity Pebbles.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.400]   Do I want to eat them in moderation?
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.120]   Do I want to use hacks to make it better?
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   Yes.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   Yes.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.360]   But I want to at least set the ground with talking about food first, that you are not
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.960]   this rare person that just doesn't like sweet food and that's how you're healthy.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.040]   No, I absolutely love sweet food.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.160]   So I always say that wellness is a tool, not an end unto itself.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   So the second that wellness makes your life worse, it's no longer wellness.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.440]   And I think a lot of people are like, oh, I'm like living this really healthy life,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.720]   but they're miserable all of the time with all of the things that they're doing to be
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   quote unquote healthy.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.880]   And healthy includes how we feel in our body, but also how we feel in our brain.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.760]   So if you're like, I can't go out to dinner with my friends because what am I going to
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   eat?
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.080]   I can't ever eat these like foods that really make me smile and bring me joy.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.400]   That's not wellness.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.040]   Wellness is actually getting in the way of you living your best life.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.040]   So I always like people to kind of zoom out and have that perspective with wellness.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.280]   And with any of the health tools that I provide my audience with, I'm like, sometimes I'll
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.560]   say like, oh, here's my nighttime routine and people be like, well, what if I am out
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.480]   late drinking with my friends or I'm at a work party and I can't do it?
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.400]   And I'm like, then don't do it.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.320]   Like if you can do it, do it.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.640]   If you can't do it, don't do it.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.040]   It's also all designed to help us get optimal sleep.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.120]   So if you're super tired and you're just going to fall asleep anyways, good, fall asleep.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.360]   That's amazing.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.840]   On top of that, I think there are also a lot of things that you can do to make the things
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.120]   that feel a little bit more fun, a little bit more indulgent, not feel as negative on
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   your body.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   So let's take sugar.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.360]   For example, when I was writing my cookbook, I spent way too much time.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.520]   I drove my editor crazy with this because I was like, for everything I wanted to have
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.880]   like my very specific perspective and why I was making the assertion that that thing
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.120]   was healthy.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.900]   And for dessert, I was like, well, what is quote unquote unhealthy about dessert?
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.080]   And the main thing is, is that it spikes your blood sugar.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.320]   So you're having a lot of sugar, your blood sugar goes up and then it'll crash down.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   You'll feel lethargic.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.160]   We've all had that sort of like tired, you know, sometimes you get like a little shaky.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.560]   You just don't feel good when your blood sugar rises and then crashes.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.000]   So that's the problem.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.600]   What can we do to solve that?
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.680]   There's a few things we can do.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.580]   One, you can kind of change the format of the dessert itself.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.040]   So I do that by adding fat fiber protein to my desserts.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.320]   You know, I'll put in something like Greek yogurt or almond butter or almond flour and
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   just kind of make it a more stable blood sugar experience from the get go.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.380]   But then there's also other fun things you can do too.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.320]   So I had a woman who calls herself the glucose goddess on my podcast.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.560]   She is amazing.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.760]   She's a biochemist who kind of hacks glucose in her body.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.840]   She wears a continuous glucose monitor and she her whole thing is studying the different
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.600]   effects that things have on your glucose.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   So she has a few different like little tricks that she recommends that I really like.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.540]   One is if you want to eat a sweet thing like Fruity Pebbles.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.120]   We all love our Fruity Pebbles and I honestly think Fruity Pebbles got me through the pandemic.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   I'm like not sure.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.060]   I was in New York for the early parts of it and I am like if I didn't have my Fruity Pebbles
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.920]   like would I be okay right now mentally?
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   And I don't think so.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.900]   But if you want something like your Fruity Pebbles, don't have it as a snack.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.400]   Have it as an actual dessert, which means after you've consumed some other type of form
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   of food.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.520]   So after you've had a main course with your protein, with your fat, your fiber, all of
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   that.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.600]   If you're craving a cookie in the middle of the day, if you're craving your Fruity Pebbles,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.400]   be like that's not off limits to me.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.920]   I'm still going to have it, but I'm going to move it to after a meal.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.720]   That's a really great hack that'll just kind of elongate your blood sugar curve and make
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.280]   sure that your glucose doesn't spike and crash.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.080]   Again eliminating all those quote unquote negative effects in your body of eating a
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.700]   lot of sugar.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.720]   Another one that I really like is her green starter hack, which is just eat something
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.800]   green before you eat anything else.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.520]   So if you eat something with a lot of fiber, it kind of creates almost like a little stopper
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.960]   in your intestines and it just slows the absorption of everything else in your body.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.800]   So literally you can do this for anything that you eat.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   Just eat like a little green salad before some vegetables if you're out at a restaurant
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.880]   before you go for the bread, which is a lot of carbs, a lot of stuff that would spike
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880]   your blood sugar.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.480]   Have a little vegetable side first.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   Have a little salad first.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.840]   You can do that with literally anything.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.960]   And that brings me to my last point, which is that I think if we think of wellness as
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.440]   deprivation based, it's not going to stick.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.480]   Again, it feels like it's making our life worse.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.920]   So with every single part of health, I like to think about what I can add to my life instead
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.360]   of what I can take away.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.520]   So instead of being like, I'm not going to eat any sugar and that's going to make me
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.720]   feel so much better, you think about I'm going to add a vegetable to every single meal and
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.200]   I'm not going to take anything away.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.440]   And I think if we start to think about what can we add to our lives, we start to feel
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.920]   nourished, we start to feel taken care of, and we start to feel like these things are
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.160]   making our life better instead of being dogmatic and taking away from our experience on this
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   planet.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.840]   So is that as simple as like, I want to order pizza tonight, but I'm just going to like
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.080]   whip up some broccoli and eat that alongside?
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   A hundred percent.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.040]   So my husband and I eat frozen pizza like quite often for dinner and we'll just make
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.800]   a little salad that we'll eat, so we'll get like one of those containers of pre-washed
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   greens.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.840]   We'll put some olive oil.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.880]   I like to like microplane a little bit of garlic, a little bit of lemon zest, and then
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.240]   squeeze the lemon juice and some salt.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   And we'll eat that first.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   So the thing is you eat the green thing first, or we keep frozen broccoli on hand.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   I love roasting frozen vegetables.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.400]   Have you ever tried that?
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.920]   No, but I know from looking you up, it's like you said roasting frozen vegetables.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.360]   And I was like, gosh, most people you talk to that have written a cookbook are like,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.320]   the only vegetable you should eat is like fresh from the farmer's market.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   No, no, no.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.000]   I mean, I love the farmer's market.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.560]   It's like very much my happy place.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.880]   And I think it's a wonderful way to get excited about food.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.600]   It feels like a very visceral experience.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.560]   You can walk around and like sample things and it feels beautiful.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.620]   And I think anything that gets you excited about healthy eating is wonderful.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.640]   But frozen vegetables and frozen fruits are phenomenal.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.320]   They often contain more nutrients than their fresh counterparts because they're flash frozen
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   at peak ripeness.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.480]   So if you pick broccoli, every bit of its journey from being picked to the grocery store,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.720]   it's going to go in a truck, it might cross the country, it might cross several countries
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   to get to you.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.760]   And then it's going to sit on the grocery store shelf for often quite a while before
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.600]   we're actually purchasing it.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.100]   And every little bit of that way, it's losing its nutrients.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.800]   So things like vitamin C especially are really quick to be lost in that journey, whereas
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.040]   if you are getting something flash frozen, it's preserving a lot more of those nutrients.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.880]   So I think we should eat fresh vegetables and fresh fruits as much as we possibly can.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.120]   But I also think that frozen fruits and veggies can be a really beautiful part of the journey.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.640]   And my frozen veggie roasting hack is like one of my absolute favorites.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.780]   So the thing that you do is you put your frozen veggies like frozen broccoli, let's say, out
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.320]   on some parchment paper, and then you put it in the oven at like 425 or something like
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.060]   that, but with nothing on it.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.080]   And the idea, I learned this when I was trying all these different ways to roast chickpeas
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.960]   and make them super, super crispy for my cookbook.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.680]   And people were like, "Oh, do it with oil at this point," or you should start with fresh
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   chickpeas or whatever.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.280]   And the thing I found that worked the best is you roast them completely dry, no oil,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.480]   because the oil traps in the moisture.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.940]   So you want all of that moisture to evaporate, and then you add the oil, and then you cook
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.940]   them normally.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.160]   So with the broccoli, you want to cook, you want to like literally not touch it, like
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.800]   dump the bag on the parchment paper, spread it out, put it in the oven, and then roast
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.640]   it until all of that moisture's evaporated.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.560]   It's already starting to brown a little bit, and then you toss it with the oil, toss it
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.760]   with some salt, toss it with whatever seasonings you want.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.800]   Cook it for like five more minutes, and you've got like beautiful frozen roasted broccoli.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.600]   Are there other vegetables it works with?
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   Most of them.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   Definitely anything cruciferous.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.720]   So like cauliflower, it works pretty well, brussel sprouts, you're not going to get quite
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.880]   the same effect as you would with like a fresh brussel sprout.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.960]   Definitely like squash and things like that that are kind of chopped and pre-prepared.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.880]   You mentioned adding veggies, and you mentioned how to do it if they're frozen, but like are
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.000]   there other good tips for how to take what you do now and make it better?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.960]   I mean, there's like a zillion.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.520]   So if we're in the realm of like still frozen veggies, which I'm really into, one of my
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.000]   favorite hacks is to keep a bag of cauliflower rice in your freezer, and you can buy this
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.520]   at like any grocery store, just like pre-prepared cauliflower rice.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.980]   It's just going to be riced cauliflower, and then you can use that as a sub for ground
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.080]   beef in pretty much any recipe.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.320]   Just do a one, like I do half ground beef and then half the cauliflower rice, so like
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.580]   a bolognese.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.640]   You can brown the ground beef and then add the cauliflower rice in and you won't know
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.920]   that it's there, but you've just added this like significant portion of vegetables to
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.920]   your dish.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.040]   I also think that cauliflower rice is amazing for thickening soups if you're making a soup
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.080]   and it kind of feels, I don't know, not that, not that, it doesn't have as much body as
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   you'd like.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.080]   It doesn't have as much heft.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.920]   You can take half the soup and then blend it with some sauteed cauliflower rice and
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.400]   then pour that back in and you'll have this really thick and beautiful and rich soup.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.660]   So I think that keeping some frozen cauliflower rice on hand at all times is a really wonderful
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.660]   hack.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.800]   I also love to sub it, like I'll put it in for half of my white rice in a dish.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.320]   So I'll cook up some white rice, delicious, lots of salt.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.060]   That's the secret to making white rice taste really good, but then I'll saute up some cauliflower
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.040]   rice and I'll just mix them together and I cannot do, like I'm not a person who can do
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.840]   cauliflower rice on its own and pretend that it's rice because it's not and it doesn't
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.880]   taste good and I need my food to taste good and that is like my number one rule of food
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.840]   is that it needs to taste good, but mixed in with normal rice, it actually adds like
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.280]   a really nice nutty note and I think enhances the dish and adds veggies instead of detracting
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.760]   from it in any way.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   I mean I'm going to ask what else because frozen cauliflower, rice, frozen broccoli,
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.760]   both good hacks.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.040]   So I would say a few things.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.200]   One, use your spices way, way, way, way, way more spices.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.800]   I always call them the original superfood, so people are always kind of trying to like
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.000]   go get these like fancy superfood powders and add them to their lives and enhance their
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.880]   health journey that way and that's great if that's what you want to do, wonderful.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.480]   But spices have so many potent therapeutic properties and they make everything you eat
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.960]   taste really, really delicious.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.720]   So I always like if there's spices listed in a recipe, I almost always pretty much double
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.040]   them like obviously do it to taste, but people way under season their food and it makes it
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   healthier and it makes it tastier.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.580]   So big fan of that.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.120]   Also a big fan of starting every single morning with a green smoothie, which I would be remiss
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.160]   not to mention.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:06.440]   I'm sort of like known for my green smoothies both in my personal life when I push them
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.760]   on people at all times.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.560]   I have a video on my Instagram where I was like testing out different green smoothies
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.680]   until I won over my little sister who hated green smoothies and I did.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.440]   I got her with a pina colada one, which I was very proud of and she liked it and drinks.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.680]   She drinks green smoothies every single morning now, which I'm very, very proud of.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:33.440]   But also, you know, in my public life, I have a green smoothie society on patrion at patreon.com/lizmoody,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.840]   which just has like all of these green smoothie recipes.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.600]   I think it's a really beautiful thing you can integrate into your day.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.840]   It tastes like a milkshake.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.880]   It takes less than five minutes to make and if you do it in the morning, for instance,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.160]   you will have had more vegetables before like 9am than most people eat in an entire day,
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.440]   which just makes you feel really good about yourself.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   So I'm a big fan of like the all in greens and I'm I'm what what's in these green
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440]   smoothies.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.280]   Okay, so the formula is greens and you can do like spinach.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   You can do mixed greens.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.040]   You can do something like arugula, but you need to balance it with I would say something
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.020]   that's a little peppery that leans into those notes, but I'd say for a starter, spinach
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.400]   or mixed mixed greens is a really nice base.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.080]   And then on top of that, you're going to do a banana, I would say, will make it taste
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   really good.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.600]   You're not going to taste the banana, but if you're just going for a delicious flavor,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   put the banana in there.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.660]   I have some recipes without if you're banana free, but good starter.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.600]   And then you want some sort of fat.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.160]   So that can be an avocado that can be Greek yogurt that can be a nut or a seed.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.440]   I think like pistachio is a really fun thing to include in a smoothie that can be chia
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.860]   seeds that can be flax seeds that can be hemp seeds that can be a nut butter, but some sort
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:48.360]   of nut or some sort of fat to get the nutrient absorption from the vegetables that you're
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   putting in.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.440]   So something like greens has a lot of fat soluble vitamins in them, and you want to
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.080]   make sure that you're actually absorbing all of those vitamins from those grains.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.420]   So some sort of fat, and that's also going to help you stay full through lunch, which
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.960]   is what we want.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.560]   That said, if your green smoothie does not make you full, please eat some food.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.400]   Like that's very important to me.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.600]   This is not meant to be a diet thing.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.080]   This is again, not meant to be restrictive in any way, shape or form.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.840]   If you're hungry, listen to your body, eat.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.360]   A lot of people will do green smoothie with like a scrambled egg on the side or something
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   like that.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   I switch it up.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   Some days a green smoothie is enough.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.240]   Some days I like to have a more robust breakfast.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   So I go either way.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.160]   So we've got our greens, our banana, our fat, and then you want to add some protein.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.240]   So if you're using some nuts or seeds, they're going to have a certain amount of protein.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.800]   You can also add in something like a protein powder.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.160]   You can add in collagen.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.140]   Again, that protein is going to elongate your blood sugar curve and it's going to keep you
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.140]   full longer.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.200]   So that's really, really important.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.960]   I like to add some frozen berries, usually like blueberries or blackberries or strawberries.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.120]   And then I like to put in like my fun flavor elements.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.400]   So this can be spices.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.960]   I love cinnamon in smoothies.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.400]   I love cardamom in smoothies.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.520]   I love cayenne is like a little bit of spice in a smoothie.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.480]   I love cacao, which just makes it taste like chocolate, which is the dream and everything.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.760]   I also love zest.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.680]   So using like some lemon zest or some orange zest, it has so many therapeutic properties,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.040]   the skin of the citrus, but it also tastes really strongly of that thing.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.600]   So if you put like orange juice in your smoothie, putting orange zest in the smoothie will taste
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.160]   even more orangey essentially, which is really, really nice.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.480]   And then a little pinch of sea salt, which is just going to bring out all of those flavors.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.560]   You always want a little bit of salt in anything that you cook.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.840]   Even if it's a sweet thing, you know, we put salt in our cookies, it brings out those flavors
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.340]   and it also adds some minerals if you're using a sea salt or a mineral salt or something
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.340]   like that.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.340]   And then just add water.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.920]   I think that blending your smoothies with a nut milk is a huge waste of money.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.160]   Like I'm just like, what are we looking for there?
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.200]   Like save your nut milk for your fruity pebbles and use water in your smoothies, blend it
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   up and drink it.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.000]   And then they also keep for, I'd say 24 hours solidly in a tightly sealed container in the
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   fridge.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.940]   So if you want to make a smoothie for two days, which I love doing a little gift from
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.320]   past you, highly recommend that as well.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   I love it.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.640]   You mentioned spices at the end.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.940]   I want to go back to your previous comment on spices and ask, do you replace your spices
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.940]   regularly?
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.540]   I wonder, I always wonder if this spice rack that I assume we probably bought 15 years
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.060]   ago or something is like, have they expired?
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.140]   Do they go bad?
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.820]   They don't like go bad per se, like you're not probably going to get food poisoning or
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.360]   something like that from your spices, but they will lose their potency in terms of both
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.020]   flavor and therapeutic benefits.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.000]   So you, if you want to know if your spice is still giving you all those therapeutic
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.920]   benefits, you can literally just taste it.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.000]   And if it doesn't taste robust and, and of that thing, then you've probably lost a fair
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.300]   amount of the therapeutic benefits.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.320]   So there's a few things you can do to prevent that.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.160]   You want to keep your spices somewhere as cold and dark and dry as possible.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.400]   So in a cabinet, not right next to your stove, not like lined up on your wall where the sun
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.020]   is coming in every single day, just as cold and dark and dry as possible.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.560]   And that will make them last longer and then seal them as well as possible.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.880]   And then use them more so that you're like, not, I mean, it's a little bit, it's a little
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.560]   bit tricky because I feel like by having them put away, you're maybe not as inspired to
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.560]   use them.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:24.000]   So take inventory regularly, put them in your dishes so that they're, they're not dying
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.020]   before you get the chance to use them.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.840]   And how long would you say the average spice lasts?
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.000]   I'd say like a year.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.560]   So would you say you do like a turnover of your whole spice?
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.360]   I don't because I use them all.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.700]   I imagine most people listening, and maybe I'm completely wrong.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.700]   I'll speak for myself.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.480]   I would say most of the spices in our spice drawer that we don't use a lot of are like
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.540]   five plus years old.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.680]   So maybe before you leave, since we're in person, give me a little spice inventory.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.400]   And I would also say that I don't think you need maybe as many spices as you think.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.560]   So sometimes people go and they try to do like this fully stocked spice rack, but then
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.960]   they realize they're really just using the same five or six spices on a regular basis
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.800]   and maybe lean into those spices.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.880]   And if a recipe has like 45 spices, be like, do I really need all of these?
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.480]   Like, can I experiment with getting most of the way there with what I have?
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.760]   I also think that spice blends are super underutilized.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.840]   So instead of buying all of the spices in something, have one or two go to spice blends
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.140]   that you're always using.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.080]   If you want to like roast vegetables and have it taste really good.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.400]   If you're doing a stir fry, you want to have it taste really good.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.960]   You have your spice blends that you can go through with that.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.640]   And that way you can use it up much more quickly.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   I love it.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.160]   Now I'm getting hungry.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.760]   And we don't have dinner plans at this house tonight.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.640]   So I'm curious, like pick a recipe from your cookbook that I and anyone listening can make
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.520]   for a meal tonight that you think will just make everyone happy.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   Ooh.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   Okay.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.640]   That I can also link to so people can try it.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.640]   I'm trying to think.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.760]   So this isn't up yet, but it will be up by the time that this goes up.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.360]   It's a taco salad.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.600]   I like salad, but the salad has to take like really, really, really good if I'm going to
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   eat salad.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   And so I'm a big fan of like hearty salads and exciting salads and things like that.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.360]   And I had a taco salad out at a restaurant in the Bay Area and I was deeply disappointed
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   by it.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.720]   And I was like, this could be so much better.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.520]   So this is just a very quick and easy taco salad.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.240]   The taco meat is plant-based, not because I am plant-based, but because I thought it
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.980]   actually tasted better that way.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.080]   So I call it accidentally plant-based.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.000]   It's a mix of pecans and frozen cauliflower rice.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.600]   So you can pull out your frozen cauliflower rice and make that with that.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   And then it's just quickly seasoned and then everything else you're just kind of like chopping
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.700]   up and you're making a really quick jalapeno dressing, which I love and pouring it over
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.700]   the top.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.700]   It's going to be really nourishing.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.700]   It's going to be really delicious.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.720]   And it's going to make you feel really, really good after you eat it.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   All right.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   We will link to that in the show notes.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   Yes.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.440]   So you were looking at the cookbook, gluten-free, dairy-free, dairy-free and plant-centered.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.940]   Is that because you are gluten-free and dairy-free or is that because you feel like that's a
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.640]   healthier way to live or how did you make that call?
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.760]   So for a few reasons, if I'm going to be completely honest, it's because the powers that be at
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.200]   publishing houses like marketing terms.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.240]   And so those are easy marketing terms that help people identify it.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   And I get it.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.520]   You know, if you're looking at a cookbook cover on Amazon, you need to be able to tell
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.400]   so quickly whether that's something that you're going to want in your life.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.080]   So identifying terms like that are really, really important.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.960]   Also I'm trying to make my food as accessible to as many people as possible.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.520]   And there definitely are people out there with celiac disease, with allergies and things
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   like that.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.280]   I would say plant forward a hundred percent.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.760]   I am trying to smoosh in vegetables at whenever possible.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.280]   I'm the biggest fan of them.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.520]   I've interviewed probably thousands of doctors at this point in my life.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.880]   And it's so interesting because they disagree about so many things about what constitutes
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.940]   a healthy diet.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.000]   But the one thing they all agree on is that like more vegetables is better.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.760]   80% or so of your diet should just be like focusing on putting vegetables in.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.160]   So I'm like, let's stop arguing over that last little bit about whether like meat or
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.200]   no meat or grains or no grains.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.640]   If we all just got the vegetable part right, we would all feel so much better.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.880]   We're arguing about that like tiny tweaky bit when we don't have the foundation laid.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.840]   And I think that happens with a lot of wellness stuff.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.600]   We're trying to like hyper optimize instead of laying the foundation that would actually
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   make the difference.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.280]   So I would say plant forward a hundred percent.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   Vegetables are the foundation.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.920]   I'm going to smoosh them in anywhere.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   But I don't follow any food rules with my diet.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.820]   And I think unless you have a specific health reason, something like celiac disease or an
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:56.120]   allergy or something like that, I would not encourage anybody to follow any restrictive
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.560]   rules either.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.240]   And for all those vegetables, do you feel like vegetables, fruits, anything, do they
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.000]   all need to be organic or what's your stance on organic food?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.200]   So look, I think that we all do the best that we can within the circumstances that we have.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.360]   The reasons to buy organic are a few, like obviously there's pesticides and things that
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.840]   you maybe don't want in your body.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.600]   And then I think you can follow easily something like the clean 15 and the dirty dozen, which
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.000]   you can easily look up online.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.840]   And that's basically a list of, you know, produce that is going to be more likely to
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.440]   be sprayed with pesticides or things that you'd put in your body.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.960]   You can also follow easy rules like bananas, avocados, things that you're not eating the
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   skin.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.360]   You probably don't need to spend your money on organic.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.920]   But then there's also issues with a lot of organic farming practices where they're using
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.840]   heavy metals and other things that you maybe don't want in your body as well.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.360]   So I think that it's complicated and it's nuanced.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.200]   And the best way to get around it is by knowing your farmer as much as possible.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.120]   And obviously that's a very privileged thing to do.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.440]   But I do think if you can go to a farmer's market and ask how they're farming, what they're
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.360]   using when they're growing, that's the absolute best practice.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.240]   And then beyond that, I would say in general, roughly, if you can afford to buy organic,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.400]   do it for things that you are eating the skin of, especially something that like when I
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.040]   was talking about the zesting, if you can get that organic, great, that's really nice.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.920]   And if you can't, then don't sweat it.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.240]   There is never a circumstance in which it's worse for you to be eating the produce.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.400]   Like if you're like, I can't afford organic produce, should I be buying produce?
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.840]   Like, yes, a hundred percent.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.040]   It's still the best thing you should be putting into your body.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.200]   Do you feel similarly about meats?
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.700]   I think meats are a little bit trickier for me.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.920]   I would say that I lean towards grass-fed, pasture-raised, ethical practices.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:53.480]   I'm also sort of like a borderline meat eater as is for ethical reasons and environmental
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   reasons.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.840]   But when it comes to meat meat, I really want it to have been raised in as ethical a way
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   as possible.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.440]   I think because we're talking about a living creature, it's a little bit different than
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.520]   when we're talking about a carrot.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.840]   You haven't mentioned anything about supplements, vitamins, that kind of stuff.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.160]   Do those have a role in like a healthy lifestyle?
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.120]   I think they absolutely can and do.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.360]   But I think it depends what your goals are.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.960]   I hate when people, you open somebody's supplement cabinet and they have like so many of them
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.120]   and you're like, "Well, what are these for?"
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.520]   And they're like, "I don't know.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.160]   It's part of being healthy."
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.720]   And I think you should be able to point to every single supplement that you are taking
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.360]   and say, "This is the need that it's filling.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.800]   This is the problem that it's solving."
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.440]   So for me, for instance, I don't eat seafood at all.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.440]   I take fish oil.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.520]   I know that having omega-3s in my diet is really good for my brain.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.300]   It's really good for my overall health.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.080]   So that is why I take my fish oil supplement.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:55.000]   I think that if you're kind of willy-nilly attacking it and taking too many, you're probably
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.680]   not having the effects, the positive effects that you want.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.200]   You're probably wasting a lot of money.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.800]   And I just think it should be a lot more of a thoughtful practice than people are using
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   it for.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.120]   Is that the same with like a daily vitamin?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   Or is that a thing?
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   I think...
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120]   So I take...
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.480]   We were talking about this off-air a little bit.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.760]   I take athletic grains.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.400]   I love athletic grains.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.480]   I think that something like a daily vitamin, particularly if it's a vitamin like athletic
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.920]   grains that's sourced in a whole food form, it's a really nice nutritional insurance.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.180]   So a lot of us would like to eat a lot better than we are eating, or we don't have time
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.600]   to make these robust veggie-rich meals.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.440]   And also there is some truth to the fact that produce doesn't necessarily have the same
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.160]   nutrient profile that it would have at one point.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.480]   The soil has been really depleted through farming practices, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.400]   So I think that it's a nice practice to have a little bit of insurance, but again, it's
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.520]   a nice to have.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.960]   And if all you can afford is really good produce, do that.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.120]   Your number one thing I want you spending money on is really good produce.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.680]   That is...
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.080]   If you can fill your diet with vegetables, you will feel better than almost any other
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.240]   practice that you can add in.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.660]   And then everything else, it's bonuses.
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.040]   It's a little bit of a cherry on top.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.320]   So stack your sundae, again, lay those foundations.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.760]   And then if you want to add the cherry on top of that, all the better.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.120]   And when you say really good produce, do you mean fresh?
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   I mean...
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   What's the really good?
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.400]   I mean a variety, I would say.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.840]   So I mean like a diverse, beautiful array of produce.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.120]   So I think something that gets lost in the produce conversation often and in the healthy
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.680]   eating conversation is how much diversity is important to our health.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.240]   So I've interviewed a number of gut health experts and people are always like looking
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.400]   for these little gut health hacks and it really comes down to eat as many types of plants
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.000]   as you possibly can on as regular of a basis as you can.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   So if you're regularly eating broccoli, maybe try Brussels sprouts, maybe try cauliflower.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.040]   If you're making your smoothie with spinach all the time, maybe swap in some mixed greens.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.120]   If you have pretty much any dish, add some fresh herbs on top.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.480]   That's a type of produce and it's going to make it taste better, it's going to make it
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.560]   look more visually appealing, so just as large of a variety as possible, as much diversity
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560]   as possible.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.200]   It's going to feed your gut microbiome, you're going to be really happy.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.980]   It sounds great.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.640]   One of our favorite things to do, and I can put a link in the show notes but you don't
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.680]   need it, is to literally go to the farmer's market and just buy all the vegetables and
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.160]   make a crazy big stir fry with just all vegetables.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.160]   I love that.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.040]   There's probably 10 or 12 vegetables in it at any given time and it's really good.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.280]   Yeah, and again, it's about finding the ways to make the vegetables taste really good because
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.360]   if you're sitting there and you're like stabbing a sad piece of broccoli, you're not going
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.280]   to enjoy the process of eating.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.280]   And also, there's some really interesting studies that show that the mood that you're
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.480]   in when you're consuming food literally impacts your digestion, impacts your nutrient absorption,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.960]   so making food tasty actually technically makes it better for you too.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   I like it.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.440]   Okay, let's get out of food for a moment.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.040]   Talk about hacks related to health, right?
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   The theme here and what you've written about, what you blog about, what you podcast about.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.280]   It's like about being healthier with people.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   What have you got?
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.520]   I know there are a bunch of things you do in your routine.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.120]   Let's talk about some.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.800]   Let's just like throw some stuff out there.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.780]   Okay, so a hack that I'm loving right now is to set the bar way lower.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:26.360]   So I think a lot of people think about something like working out or meditation and they're
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   like, "I don't know.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.720]   I'm so busy already.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.440]   I know these things are good for me, but how do I actually fit them into my life?"
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.520]   And I think that if instead of sitting down and being like, "Well, I have to do 20 minutes
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.160]   of meditation to make it effective," if you're like, "I'm going to do five minutes of meditation.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.000]   I'm going to do 10 minutes of meditation," first of all, it makes it so much more achievable
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   and attainable.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.680]   And if something is achievable and attainable, you're so much more likely to keep going at
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.680]   it.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.760]   You're not going to try to do it for a week, fail and give up.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.400]   But then also, most of the time when you sit down and try to meditate for 10 minutes,
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   you're going to love it.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.200]   You'll feel really good and you might even want to keep going.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   Or maybe you'll do 10 minutes for a week and then the next week you'll do 11 minutes, the
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.360]   next week you'll do 12 minutes.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.500]   And actually, I had a woman on my podcast who studies focus and she studies meditation
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.240]   and its effects on your brain.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:19.120]   And 12 minutes is literally the minimum viable dose to have incredibly potent neurological
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   effects.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.820]   So if you're one of those people who feels scattered all the time and you go to answer
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.320]   an email and then you find yourself on Instagram and you don't even know how your phone got
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:36.040]   into your hand, doing just 12 minutes of mindfulness practice every single day will massively help
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   that type of thing.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.600]   It'll help you focus your attention, it'll help you use your attention in the way that
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.260]   you want to use your attention.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.080]   So that's so much less than most of us think.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.160]   And by the way, that's not even every single day she does that.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.320]   I think four to five days a week was the study.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.940]   So 12 minutes, four to five days a week.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.000]   Same thing with working out.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.740]   I had a doctor on my podcast for a Ask the Doctor Burnout Edition.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.160]   So we talked all about what are the causes of burnout in our bodies and our brains and
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.480]   how can we address them.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.560]   And she was, we were talking about the minimum viable dose of working out and it's anything
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.080]   that gives you a state of change.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.520]   So anything that makes it so that you sweat so that your heart rate goes up, that is quote
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.920]   unquote enough.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.360]   And I think that bar is so much lower than get in your car, driving to the gym, doing
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.200]   an hour class and yelling at yourself if you're not doing all of those things.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:34.040]   So one of my favorite hacks is anything that you want to do in your life, make it easier,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.000]   make it like less, less of a time commitment and make it fun.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.920]   That's another really good hack is that anything that you want to do, if you can make it enjoyable,
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.080]   which sounds so silly, you're like, of course, like if you make something enjoyable, it will
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.280]   be easier to do.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:55.380]   But we, I think there's this pervasive attitude with wellness that unless you're like beating
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:00.320]   yourself up, it's not really wellness, that there's like an element of suffering involved.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.560]   And that's not true at all.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:08.120]   So for instance, I had Katie Melkman on my podcast and she studies how we can essentially
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.000]   make the choices that we want to make and actually stick to them, how we can make those
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   changes.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.560]   And one of her favorite things that she recommends is taking something that you really love.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.680]   So if you really love like a TV show or a specific podcast, like all the hacks are healthier
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.720]   together, save that podcast for some time that you're doing something that's a little
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.560]   bit hard for you to motivate yourself to do.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.680]   So for me, that's working out.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   I hate working out.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.840]   I literally like if I could just lay on the couch like a potato for the rest of my life,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.360]   I would absolutely do it.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.660]   But I know that I feel so much better after I work out.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.080]   So I save my favorite podcasts.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.440]   I only listen to them when I work out and then I get excited to work out because I'm
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.920]   like, Oh my gosh, I get to listen to my favorite podcast.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.500]   You can put on music that you love while doing your taxes.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.800]   You can have like a little treat, like a food that you eat or a favorite wine or something
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.880]   like that, or a friend that you call when you go for walks.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.480]   There's all these ways to sort of pair the thing that you really, really love with the
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.680]   thing that you have a harder time motivating yourself to do.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.960]   And it makes it fun and it creates that association in your brain so that you start to love the
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.560]   thing that you thought you didn't love in the first place.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.160]   Does that mean that you wouldn't listen to your favorite podcast unless you're working
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   out?
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.960]   She recommends saving your like maybe you listen to other podcasts another time, but
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.680]   she recommends saving the things that like you really love that really motivate you for
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.280]   when you're doing the hard things.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   I like that.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.520]   And I know meditation because I've heard you talk about it was something that you tried
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.240]   for a while and it just didn't stick.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.900]   And I think I know I have and many people have been like, "Yeah, I downloaded Headspace
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.840]   and I did that and then it didn't work" and you found a way to make it work.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.120]   Can you talk a little bit about that journey?
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.240]   So my meditation journey has been really interesting.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.840]   I started meditating during like what I like to call my mental breakdown period.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.920]   I was living in London with my now husband and I became completely agoraphobic.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   I started having panic attacks whenever I left the house.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.720]   And that's kind of the beginning of my wellness journey in general.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:15.000]   I was like, I was like laying prone in bed and like emailing sources about how I could
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.040]   essentially stop having panic attacks at every single second.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.960]   And a lot of them emailed me back, which was really surprising.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.240]   I was like literally emailing like the head of neurology at Stanford and I was like, "Please
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   sir, can you help me?
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.040]   I can't leave my house."
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.660]   And a lot of them recommended meditation, which really surprised me because I was reaching
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.400]   out to kind of people more in the hard science arena.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.200]   They also recommended foods and supplements and that's how I began to cobble together
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.920]   my personal wellness journey.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.520]   So I've tried meditating with headspace and it did help a little bit.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.720]   I will say the Andy Pudding Comb has like a very soothing voice, so nice, nice British
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.040]   tones in there.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.560]   And I was in England and that was probably the only British person that I was like regularly
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.360]   having interactions with was Andy Pudding Comb in my ears.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.000]   So I do think that it helped a little bit.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.200]   And then later for a story, I did Vedic meditation training, which is much like transcendental
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.640]   meditation training.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.800]   And that worked for me, but not for the reasons that you might think.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.240]   So TM is a mantra based meditation.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.260]   So you get a secret mantra, you like go, you pay money and then you go to this like five
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.200]   day workshop and then they whisper to you your secret mantra.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.400]   I don't know where it comes from or like why.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   They pick it.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   They like tell you your mantra.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.720]   And I think the idea is that like if you went to five different teachers, they'd like tell
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.840]   you the same mantra based on, I don't know.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.400]   I literally don't know what is based on like your height or your vibe or your energy or
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   like your name.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   I literally don't know.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.000]   Um, but you get your mantra, you're not supposed to tell it to anybody.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.320]   So like, I don't know my husband's mantra and he doesn't know my mantra, but we know
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.840]   like he knows my Gmail password, but he doesn't know my mantra.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.880]   Um, and then you repeat that mantra to yourself in your head over and over and over when you
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880]   meditate.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.920]   So one of the reasons that I think it works is because it focuses your attention instead
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:09.000]   of being like, don't think about anything, which makes you think about everything.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   You have a thing to think about.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.720]   You just think about your mantra over and over.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.840]   So I think you could use literally any mantra and it would have that effect.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.400]   So hum is a really great starter mantra.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.640]   You can just sit there and repeat so hum to yourself in your head and I think it'll have
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.920]   a really positive effect.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.320]   You can also just sit there and like watch your breath or you could listen to Andy and
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   that's great.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.200]   But the other reason that I think that it was so effective was because it was really
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:38.720]   expensive and I think that making an investment in something in that way is so motivating
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.360]   in a way that we don't talk about.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.320]   So instead of being like, well, I don't feel like meditating today, I was like, oh, I spent
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.880]   $500 on this stupid course.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.080]   Like you better meditate to make it worth the money that you spent on the course.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.440]   So I do think that to the extent that you have the privilege to make a financial investment
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.480]   in something, it works for something like, um, booking a workout class in advance.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.880]   Or there's even sites where you can like bet against your ability to do something.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.240]   So like if you want to quit smoking or you want to, you know, work out every day or something
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.240]   like that.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:17.140]   I do think if you can tie your finances in with it a little bit, it is weirdly motivating.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.360]   So I've been a pretty regular meditator again.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   My bar is low.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.920]   I don't think I need to be perfect.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.720]   I don't need to do it every single day and I don't break myself ever.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.600]   But I do think that putting the cost investment on the line was a really big motivating factor
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   for it.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   Finally sticking.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   That's awesome.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.680]   I know a handful of people that swear by their mantra.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.040]   And every time I'm like, I don't understand it.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.040]   What is the mantra?
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.240]   No one will ever look into it like more like, where does the mantra come from?
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   I don't know.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   I have no idea.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   You should try it.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   Do you meditate?
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.720]   I have like spent time with it, trying it.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.760]   And you know, like we were in on a trip, we'll go in a hotel, might have like a breath meditation
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   class.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   We'll go do it.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.520]   I'm not afraid of it, but I just have not ever found a way to make it stick.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.280]   But it's something that it's like on that long list of things that I want to bring back
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.520]   into life, but has been on the list for years.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.560]   I also find it helpful to kind of like literally look up all of the health benefits of it because
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   the second that you are aware of all of the massive benefits you can get in your life
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.960]   by doing something like meditating, it just becomes so much more motivated.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.200]   And you can also do I on the focus episode of the podcast, we talked about like whether
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.440]   you could just do activities mindfully, like mindfully wash your dishes or mindfully go
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   for a walk.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.520]   And that does have a certain amount of benefits, but not nearly the same benefits as that concentrated
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.480]   dose of mindfulness of 12 minutes a day, which she talked about, interestingly, is partially
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:52.000]   like training ourselves to sit in discomfort and training ourselves to not like the experience
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   in a way.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I like that.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Like forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.120]   A few other things that I know you at least regularly do.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   Cold showers.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   Cold showers.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   I know.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   We talked about this on my, when I interviewed you.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   You don't do them.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   Well, it's funny.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.720]   So I, sometimes I want a cold shower.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.480]   It's not about if you want a cold shower, but sometimes, so I don't have a practice
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.640]   of like forcing myself to take a cold shower, but sometimes I'm like, I just kind of enjoy
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.800]   a cold shower right now.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.200]   My wife thinks I'm crazy.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.640]   When you're in like Columbia or like just in normal life, like some days I'm like, I'm
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:30.320]   running hot today and I'll take a shower and I'll just like, it's not the coldest it gets,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.920]   but it's by no means warm.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.920]   Right.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.920]   Okay.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.920]   I think what you do is not that.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   It is not that.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:41.200]   And I would actually say that wanting to do it almost takes away from the reason that
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   we do it.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.760]   And when I explain why you'll understand.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.800]   So first of all, I want to preface, I do not do the whole shower cold.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.400]   Like I am shampoo weed and washing my body in a nice warm, toasty shower, like you might
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   think.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.840]   And then at the very end, I breathe in really deeply and I turn the thing to as cold as
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.840]   it gets.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.600]   And the idea is you want to be as cold as you can comfortably be without feeling like
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.000]   you're in any sort of danger in any way.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.720]   So I go as cold as possible and I do a minute is my goal.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.160]   Always again, kind of having those lower goalposts, but sometimes I'll go a minute and a half
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   up to two minutes.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.920]   And I think aiming for 12 to 15 minutes a week is ideal.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   Not a day.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:26.280]   I mean, when I heard 12 to 15 minutes, I was like, wow, that's a, you know, I got 12 minutes
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   of meditation a day.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.040]   I got 12 minutes of cold, 12 to 15 minutes a week, which is not that much.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.800]   And again, you're kind of like habit stacking.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.080]   You're in the shower already.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.000]   I like it because it's this tiny, tiny, tiny thing that you can do that'll have a big effect
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   on your health.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.560]   So you're like, what is the effect on your health?
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.600]   First of all, if your vein, a cold shower is going to make your skin glow.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.160]   It's going to make your hair really shiny.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.720]   So like, just if you want to look really pretty, which I can tell by your face, you're like,
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.400]   this is appealing to me.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.120]   If that is the goal, it's going to help with that.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.840]   So the same reason you see people do like their ice rollers for inflammation and like
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.120]   face puffiness, the cold shower is going to have that effect, but basically on your entire
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120]   body.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   Wonderful.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.760]   The reason I do it though, is to help balance my dopamine levels.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.840]   So do you know Dr. Anna Lemke?
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   I do not.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:16.600]   She is a wonderful Stanford professor who basically her entire practice is devoted to
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.840]   studying dopamine and dopamine is the neurochemical of motivation.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.400]   So it's the thing when you're like, I wish, I think people confuse it with serotonin a
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   lot and I certainly did before I interviewed her.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   It's not the chemical of happiness.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   It's about motivation.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.580]   It's about our desire and drive to do things.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:39.440]   So the thing with dopamine is that when you are doing things that are really like dopamine,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.800]   they really encourage the dopamine production in your brain.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:47.020]   So a lot of the technology that we use and drugs and alcohol, these things that are like
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.000]   so easy to motivate yourself to do, it's because they encourage your dopamine receptors to
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.600]   essentially pump out dopamine.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.360]   But when you do that, your dopamine can essentially get out of balance, which has a number of
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.720]   pretty negative effects on you.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.920]   It makes it harder for you to be motivated to do the things that you want to do in your
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:10.240]   life and it can also make it harder for you to find pleasure in the same way in simple
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:16.080]   things like going for a walk or watching the sunset or just these like little moments.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.860]   It's why I think sometimes you'll see like a group of friends out at dinner together
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.020]   and instead of wanting to talk to each other, they're all kind of like wanting to be on
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.600]   their phones and you're like, you're, you're doing the fun thing.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.940]   Like you're out with your friends, but that dopamine imbalance is causing you to want
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.840]   to reach for your technology even in those moments.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.240]   So if we can do things that feel a little bit uncomfortable, we can bring our dopamine
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.180]   back into balance, which will make it easier for us to motivate ourselves to do hard things
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:50.400]   in the other facets of our lives and easier for us to experience pleasure in those like
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.920]   smaller moments that aren't causing these huge dopamine bursts.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.080]   So hard things include things like cold showers.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:05.200]   So if you can just add in this little moment of being uncomfortable, of pushing yourself
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:11.560]   to do something that's a little bit difficult for you, it has all of these longer outsized
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   positive effects.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.680]   By the way, it doesn't need to just be a cold shower.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.280]   Things like she mentioned in the episode, like walking to your groceries in the rain.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:26.120]   Like the big takeaway for me was that discomfort isn't something that we're trying to eliminate
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.520]   from our lives.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.700]   Discomfort actually has this really positive and balancing effect.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.400]   So if you find yourself as the type of person who's always reaching for your phone, who
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.760]   has a hard time getting motivated, who isn't sure like where they can find those little
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.140]   moments of pleasure in their life, I think looking and leaning into those moments of
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.120]   discomfort can feel really satisfying.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.480]   There are also a lot of health benefits of cold water as a therapy.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.760]   So you didn't even mention all that world, but I know that cold plunges and Wim Hof,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:07.820]   who some people listening know other people can Google, has done a ton of stuff with the
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.760]   health benefits of cold water therapy.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.640]   And I think a lot of that comes down to inflammation.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.760]   I think if we can sort of manage our inflammation levels at a base state, it has these cascading
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.880]   positive effects on our bodies.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.800]   But for me, as a person who finds it very hard to do hard things, I like the idea that
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.360]   I can do this one little hard thing and I'll make all the other hard things feel so much
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   easier.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.360]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.800]   So to get very specific, you turn on the cold water.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.760]   Are you then like showering, splashing all over, getting it everywhere?
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   So I'm clean by then.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.760]   Are you just like standing there frozen?
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.160]   So at first I do my face because again, I'm trying for my glowing skin effects.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.640]   So I am vain.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.120]   And so I first put my face on her.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   That's horrible.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.160]   That's like excruciating.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   But I do that probably for like 20 to 30 seconds.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.320]   Then I do my front and then I turn around and I do my back.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.520]   I do try to kind of do right on the back of my neck because that encourages brown fat
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.600]   in your body, which has a whole host of positive effects.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.400]   Look up brown fat if you would like to.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.440]   And then I just try to withstand it as long as I possibly can until I turn it off and
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.440]   get out.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.920]   And again, I give myself full permission to stop at 60 seconds every single time.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.760]   I think that keeping it as quick as possible in the 60 seconds goes by really, really fast,
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   you know?
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   I like it.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   I will.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   Will you try it?
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   I will try it.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   Will you commit to try it for?
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.760]   This is another wellness thing.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.040]   I think that we often are like, oh, I like did the wellness thing.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   Where's my great effect?
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.160]   But you're not using it long enough and not using it consistently enough to get those
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   benefits.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.160]   That same with pretty much anything in wellness.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.020]   So add in your vegetables, do it for a month, do your workout for a month or two before
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.500]   you start sitting around and being like, why isn't it working?
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.500]   Meditate for a month or two.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.200]   So how long are you going to commit to doing your cold showers for?
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   Hmm.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.600]   It's funny because we almost, we have a hot tub and I was like, maybe I should just turn
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.940]   the water and just let it get cold and then just do like the full submersion.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.680]   You can buy a cold plunge pool.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.680]   I know.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.280]   In a conversation in a past episode, I talked about the DIY versus like the fancy expensive
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   one.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.840]   I'm down to experiment.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   But okay.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.400]   So this I do think though, you're immediately trying to like complicate it.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.640]   And I feel like do the plunge thing later.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.080]   Transform your hot tub later.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.360]   But for right now, literally with doing nothing, you could take a cold shower at the end of
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.360]   your shower today.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.480]   So I'm like, set your bar a little lower.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.880]   Well, let's, let's, I'll try it for April.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Okay.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   All of April.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.080]   And then you, will you like announce on Twitter or something how it went for you?
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   I'll just talk about it.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.080]   I'll bring it up.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   Okay.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.080]   Stay tuned for Chris's cold shower journey.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   I'm going to do cold showers for a month.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   Everybody should join you too.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.080]   Anybody listening who hasn't had a cold shower, join Chris on his cold shower journey.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   Let's do it.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   30 days or 30.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.080]   April's 30 days.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.960]   Um, though, by the time you hear this, maybe you'll make it May.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   What about circadian walks?
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.640]   Sounds much more pleasurable than a cold shower.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.960]   I love my cirque walk.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.200]   So the circadian walk is the idea.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.320]   I don't know if you've heard of a hot girl walk, but that's just like, I have not heard
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.320]   of a hot girl walk.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.680]   It's literally just walking.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.240]   And I think there's a lot of different ways that people are kind of trying to make something
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:23.280]   as simple and wonderful as walking like trendy and circadian walks essentially bring a little
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:28.080]   bit of science into the age old practice of walking, which is a really beautiful and wonderful
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   practice.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.440]   Um, speaking of the focus episode, she said one of the best ways if you want to like regain
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   focus for a meeting or something like that, it's just go for like a 10 minute walk.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.400]   Something where you can look a long ways in the distance where you're not thinking about
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.840]   anything directed.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.440]   And if you have like a big meeting or a speech or presentation, it'll help massively with
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.200]   reinvigorating that focus.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.360]   But a circadian walk, you get the benefits of ambulation of walking, but also you're
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.220]   going to help control your circadian rhythm.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.440]   So this is a 10 minute walk outside before 10 a.m. to help set your circadian rhythm
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.640]   for your day.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   What is your circadian rhythm?
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   Do you know what your circadian rhythm is?
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.240]   I mean, I probably am not going to explain it like you would, but, uh, the kind of general,
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.800]   yeah, let's just let you explain it.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.280]   So your circadian rhythm, I think a lot of people think about it in the context of sleep.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   So it does impact your sleep hugely.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:23.680]   And I would say if you go for a circadian walk again, 10 minutes outside before 10 a.m.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.820]   for I'd say a week or two, you'll probably start to notice some really positive effects
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:33.120]   in your sleep, but your circadian rhythm also impacts so much more than that.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.480]   Like pretty much every single part of your body is running on its own little clock.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.560]   Like your digestion is running on its own little circadian rhythm, your hormones.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.500]   So when you set your circadian rhythm, when you encourage your circadian rhythm to function
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:53.320]   optimally, you're actually having all of these downstream effects of it outside of just your
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.800]   sleep being better.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.820]   So again, it's 10 minutes before 10 a.m.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.520]   You do not have to walk.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.320]   You can just stand there and look at the sun.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.240]   I do think there's like minor benefits to moving your body.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.800]   It helps wake you up if you're going to just like stand there.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Why not?
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.400]   But sometimes I will if I'm feeling very lazy.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.960]   And then I would say the second and that's my circ walk.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.400]   I have a highlight on my Instagram at Liz Moody that has kind of like a bunch of detailed
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   questions.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.520]   Although if you want to ask any, we can get into it like sunglasses or no sunglasses,
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.520]   sunscreen or no sunscreen.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:27.560]   Like people really like to nitpick the little details apart.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.480]   But then I'd say the second circadian walk is the walk that's right as the sun is going
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   down.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.880]   So the number one time if you can do it is in the morning, closer to when you wake up
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.880]   is better.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.960]   But I would say 10 a.m. is sort of the cutoff to get the benefits.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.880]   And then if you can also do it as the sun is going down, as you're getting those sort
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.800]   of like pinky orangey yellow tones of sunset, again, that will help kind of encourage your
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.640]   circadian rhythm to function at its optimal level, which is going to help your sleep.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.880]   It's going to help your mood.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.240]   It's going to help your hormones.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.600]   It's going to help your digestion the whole the whole nine yards.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   I love it.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.160]   What other things in your routine are you doing?
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   We got cold showers.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.400]   We got circadian walks.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.200]   OK, so here's a weird one.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.120]   Do you know what hydroxyapatite is?
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.360]   No, I just assume the answer to all of these obscure questions.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:17.960]   The answer is just hydroxyapatite is it's a fluoride alternative in toothpaste.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:22.520]   So I had I do these like Ask the Doctor episodes where I do deep dives with functional medicine
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.960]   practitioners and I had a dentist on and I hear all the time people are like, oh, I don't
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.000]   want to listen to the dentist episode because that sounds really boring.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.720]   But the more that we find out about our mouths, the more that we're finding out that it really
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   impacts our entire health of our body.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   Like so much so that when I had the doctor on the Ask the Doctor immune health edition,
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.160]   I said, what's one thing we can do that will support our immune system?
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.840]   She was like, take care of your mouth because it's impacting your immune system.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.000]   It's impacting your cardiovascular health.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.360]   It's impacting your brain health.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:55.080]   Like literally your mouth microbiome is where all of these things are starting.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:00.600]   And fluoride, we're finding out more and more has these really negative impacts on our overall
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.600]   health.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.680]   So you want all the benefits.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   It's good for teeth.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   Nobody's disputing that.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   Everybody's like fluoride.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.680]   Great for teeth.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.680]   We love it.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.400]   Maybe not so much for our overall health.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:15.200]   So if we want the benefits of fluoride for our teeth without having the negative elements
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.280]   of fluoride for our health, hydroxyapatite is a fluoride alternative.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.520]   It's been used in Japan for like 30 years now.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.960]   It's very safe.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:29.520]   It's literally as effective or more effective than fluoride in tons and tons of studies.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.120]   You can find it in a toothpaste called Risewell, a toothpaste called Boca.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.960]   Those are just like normal toothpaste that you can buy online and you're getting all
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:42.320]   of the mouth benefits while protecting your mouth microbiome and protecting the more downstream
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.700]   effects of fluoride in your body.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.700]   So hydroxyapatite toothpaste.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:51.020]   And I'd say in a larger way, making little swaps to the things that you use every single
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.020]   day.
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.700]   So that's another, you know, people are like, oh, do I have to like wear organic clothes
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.420]   and do all this stuff?
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.420]   And I'm like, well, make over your bed.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:03.860]   Like you're going to spend 12 hours, well, you're going to spend eight hours a day in
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.460]   your bed.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.940]   And if you can make your bed this little wellness haven, then you can kind of skip a lot of
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.940]   the other stuff.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.220]   You can get a mattress that's not off gassing.
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:18.900]   If you can get like I have organic sheets, I have a hypoallergenic pillow, things like
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.900]   that.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.580]   I have a silk pillowcase so that my hair and my skin looks really good.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.180]   I tape my mouth at night to sleep.
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:30.780]   I think there's all of these things that you can do while you're sleeping to essentially
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.880]   enhance your wellness that you're not like having to think about during the day.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.020]   So that was a lot of things.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.620]   What is taping your mouth?
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:43.940]   Taping your mouth is the idea that essentially when you're breathing through your nose, you're
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.860]   getting a lot more health benefits for your body than when you're breathing through your
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.860]   mouth.
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:49.860]   And I feel very strongly about this.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:55.820]   I actually had a reconstructive rhinoplasty in October where they took, I broke my, I
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.300]   went surfing one time in my whole life and I broke my nose.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:06.100]   I hit myself in the face with the surfboard in Brazil and I got it like fixed after that.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.780]   And after they fixed it, I couldn't breathe through my nose.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:14.460]   And the effects of not being able to breathe through your nose are so well researched and
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.180]   so much worse than what we think.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:22.660]   So for instance, my really severe anxiety started pretty closely with the time that
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:24.340]   I stopped being able to breathe through my nose.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.140]   And I'm not saying it's just that because obviously there's so many factors in one's
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.740]   life that you have to consider with something like anxiety.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.720]   But I also don't think that it's completely separate or completely unrelated.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.620]   So we want to breathe through our nose as much as possible.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.220]   It decreases stress.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.900]   It takes your body out of this like fight or flight mode.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.580]   It just helps with so many, it helps you think better.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:51.540]   It helps eliminate that sort of like foggy brain situation.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.540]   It's just generally so good for us.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:57.940]   But many of us have trained ourselves to breathe through our mouths all the time.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:03.820]   So if you have a nose that can have air go through it, which I do now because I had a
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:09.520]   piece of my rib taken and they built out my nose so it's like bigger and has passageways
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.860]   that are wide enough for air now.
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:17.420]   So if you have a nose that can have air go through it, a nice practice to do is to sort
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:21.740]   of gently tape your mouth and then it forces you to breathe through your nose.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.620]   So it's not a physical issue.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.860]   It's more of a habitual issue that you're trying to correct.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.180]   And if you're worried about it, if you're worried about like suffocating, there's mouth
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:33.860]   tapes that you can get online that very much allow you to breathe through your mouth.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:38.020]   They just kind of encourage you to breathe through your nose to experience all those
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.020]   positive effects.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.260]   And you do this every night?
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.580]   I do it most nights.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.580]   Wow.
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:44.580]   It also like helps with snoring.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:50.580]   Again, if we're going from a vanity perspective, a lot of people who have like weaker chins,
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.020]   you'll start to see a difference in that if you start breathing through your nose because
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.180]   it literally reshapes your jaw.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.460]   In essence, it'll help with your teeth health because when you're breathing through your
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.260]   mouth overnight, your mouth is drying out and you want to keep all that saliva in there
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:09.380]   because that's the thing that's like essentially protecting your enamel.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:13.900]   So if you're, yeah, it'll help with your teeth health, which will again have all those downstream
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.740]   positive effects because of your oral microbiome taking care of that.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.500]   Your mouth won't, your breath won't smell as bad in the morning.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   Not you.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.500]   I don't mean to point to you.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.500]   I'm like, wow, I'm sitting here.
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:27.320]   I'm like, we're only five feet away and it's afternoon, but okay.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:32.480]   So so much of what we do nowadays, especially I think about me and work and living at home
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.500]   during the pandemic, everything's online, everything's virtual.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:40.540]   When you came here today, you gave me a physical product, which I thought was so cool.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.060]   And it immediately made me jealous because I was like, "Gosh, I have a podcast.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.060]   I have all these listeners.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.140]   I don't have a physical product.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.060]   I wish I could have something to give people yet."
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.020]   So I need to get inspired there.
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.060]   If anyone has ideas, let me know.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:55.380]   But can you talk about the deck of cards you gave me?
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.380]   Okay.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.380]   It's the Healthier Together deck.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.820]   I'm just, I'm allergic to boring conversation.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:06.060]   I am also, like I mentioned, I'm a extroverted introvert and introverted extrovert.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.700]   So I want to be around people and I want to have the conversations.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.940]   But sometimes I think there's a lot of pressure into taking it to those deep levels.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.620]   I think that there's, you kind of stay in the like, well, how are you?
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.580]   What's going on in your life?
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.700]   What are the world events?
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.340]   When actually we really want to talk about like those foundational things, like the things
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.340]   that make us the people that we are.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:29.940]   So I wanted to create a deck that basically gives you an excuse to have all the types
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:35.220]   of conversations that we want to be having that maybe are harder to bring into our everyday
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.220]   lives.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:40.540]   I actually think it's a huge reason why people love podcasts is because I just met you, but
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.620]   we're getting to have these sort of like deeper, more introspective conversations simply because
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.900]   there's a mic in front of us.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.860]   So what I like to say about the deck is it lets you get a lot of the benefits of doing
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.220]   something like a podcast.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.860]   It lets us bring the questions of something like a podcast into your kitchen table.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.000]   So I recommend like having one in your car, I made it really pretty so you can like leave
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.780]   it out on your coffee table, leave it out on your kitchen table, and then you can just
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.660]   pull out a card anytime with a friend, with your partner, with like your mom and dad on
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.060]   a zoom date instead of you're just like, okay, we like talked about Aunt Sally last week.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.060]   That's so great.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.900]   Um, I'm glad your golf game is good.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:18.900]   You know, you can pull out a card and really get to know people as people and people will
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:19.900]   surprise you.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:25.180]   My husband surprises me with his answers all of the time and it makes me feel closer to
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:29.100]   him and more connected to him and love him so much more.
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:30.100]   I love it.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.620]   Um, funny enough, when we had our au pair first arrived, the au pair agency sent us
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.300]   a deck of cards with questions.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.300]   Oh my God.
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.940]   To try to get to know each other and your family.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.940]   Oh my God.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.940]   That's so fun.
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   The weird thing was...
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:43.940]   Were they good?
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.940]   Some of them were good.
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:49.220]   The strangest thing was some of them are labeled like this is an au pair only question and
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.180]   this is a host family only question.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.180]   Huh.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:56.020]   And you would think they would be things like, what is it like growing up in America?
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:02.340]   But some of them were strange where it's like the host family no au pair question is like,
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.340]   what does happiness mean?
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.860]   And it's like, why is this a specific question?
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.860]   Why can't we all discuss it?
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.860]   That's so interesting.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:12.260]   Um, but I've really liked that, but we've tapped it out and it's not as big of a deck
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.260]   as this.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.500]   So I'm excited for this.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:19.240]   The card I pulled out somewhat randomly that I'll share as an example of a conversation
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.940]   starter is, have you been anywhere in the world where you've thought that people here
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.900]   really got it right in terms of living a happy or healthier life?
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900]   So where was it?
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.860]   So that's one of the questions that actually came directly out of my podcast.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:36.500]   So I like to ask people that at the end of episodes, because I think it says a lot about
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.960]   what we consider a good life.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.540]   It's not just about where are people getting it right.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.660]   It's like, what is getting it right mean to you?
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.820]   And the questions are really designed around that.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.180]   And they're also designed, we talked a lot when I interviewed you for my podcast about
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:53.180]   some of the more uncomfortable conversations, especially around money and things like that.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.180]   We have a whole wealth category in there.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.300]   So there's one, uh, question and I love these questions.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.080]   They are interactive.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.880]   So there's one that's like, would you feel comfortable sharing your salary with the group
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.220]   of people that you're playing with?
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.260]   Why or why not?
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:13.420]   And you can kind of explore these, these more taboo topics that people feel less comfortable
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.980]   directly addressing, but it's not you.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.300]   You're not the one bringing up the card.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.300]   Like it's not on you.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.180]   It gives you a little bit of like a, an excuse to go there.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.780]   Well, I like it.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.660]   We're going to bring this to dinner tonight and I'll let you know how it goes.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.660]   For what it's worth.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:31.660]   My answer to that question, because you didn't ask me, uh, in our conversation was that when
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.900]   we were in Syria for about three weeks, Syria is my favorite country in the world.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.020]   I cannot believe you've been there because you've been, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:45.660]   What I found was that everyone was willing to put everything in their life on hold to
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.500]   get to know someone.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:53.900]   And so we would be like meeting someone and like, you would think no one had anything
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.900]   to do.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:55.900]   We later learned that's not the case.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.340]   They'd be like, do you want to come in for coffee?
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.420]   The aggressive tea and coffee consumption.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.420]   And then we would meet someone and someone's uncle would show up and then the uncle would
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.540]   be like, do you want to come to my house and meet my family?
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:13.140]   And we were like, but it was more about getting to meet people and hospitality and all kinds
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   of stuff.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.500]   Then it was, it wasn't required.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:20.020]   I had no expectation and it just felt like people genuinely wanted to get to know you
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.060]   and they would go grab things from their family and show you pictures.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.940]   And these are strangers, like people I didn't know.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.520]   And it was so great.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.140]   And I feel like, you know, we're, especially in the last two years, we're not in America,
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.340]   we're not so much like that.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.700]   We're not like, Hey, random person.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   I don't know.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700]   Come on over.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.740]   Although in our case, you were here in my house and we met in person today.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.900]   I can't believe you've been, I think it's, the hospitality is unmatched.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.980]   The people are so kind.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.660]   I think that like literally expresses in such a beautiful way.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.140]   One of the many reasons I love that country so much also because there's citrus trees
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.140]   everywhere.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.740]   Like your Damascus is this like walled city and the streets are so tiny.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.700]   Like they're basically walking only streets and they're like cobblestone or sometimes
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.900]   a tiny car will like try to drive through and everybody like, ah, but like they smell
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.300]   like citrus.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.940]   And I just think it's like one of the, I mean, when did you go?
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.940]   We went in 2009.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.940]   I went in 2009 too.
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:15.940]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.940]   So it was wonderful.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.380]   Like right before.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.060]   I don't know when it'll be a great place I would recommend going to.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.100]   But I want to take my husband so much.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.240]   I'm certain in the future it will.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.540]   And that leads me to the last question I want to ask you, which is, and I'll, I'll give
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.660]   you because we didn't talk much about your experience living nomadically.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:38.740]   So someone will have to find you on the internet to learn more there, the latitude to pick
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.740]   anywhere you want.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.740]   Oh my gosh.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:45.340]   Most people pick wherever they're from, but I'm not from anywhere right now.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:50.020]   And just tell me a place that, uh, you know, a place to someone you'd recommend have a
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.180]   meal, grab a drink and something they should do.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.180]   Okay.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.180]   Okay.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.380]   I'm going to do London, which I haven't gone to in my nomad life.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:01.300]   So just for a little bit of context, my husband and I have been living nomadically for like
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.300]   the last two years.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.660]   So we spend four to six weeks in different places usually because they're beautiful mountain
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:07.660]   places.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.780]   We live in Airbnbs, uh, and, and just explore, which has been really, really wonderful.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:15.820]   And we can spend our rent money, which was New York rent money on the Airbnbs.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:21.780]   And that's, it's, it's been really magical, but we lived in London, uh, I'd say like five
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.780]   or 10.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   I don't know.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.860]   We lived in London when he went to graduate school and it's a really wonderful city.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:30.980]   So I would say the thing I want you to eat is I want you to go to Dishoom, which have
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   you heard of Dishoom?
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.980]   No.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.700]   It is a phenomenal Indian restaurant.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.780]   They have started to sort of like branch it out a little bit more.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.260]   I think there's one in Edinburgh now and there's, um, a few in different parts of London.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.020]   I like the shortage one.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.660]   It's such a cool vibe inside.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.780]   It's just like very cool decorations.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.420]   The black doll is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.740]   It's just phenomenal Indian food.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.280]   So I want you to eat there.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.760]   You can get a cocktail there too, because you know, we'll have you get a drink elsewhere,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.980]   but I want you to eat there roughly.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.140]   And then I want you to go for a canal walk.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.700]   So this is one of my favorite things to do.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:12.220]   You can start, um, at, okay, you can start at Paddington station.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:16.260]   I think you can even start further along, but you can start at Paddington and you can
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:19.820]   essentially walk the canals through the entire city of London.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:24.140]   You can walk pretty much all the way to East London, but I like to walk to Camden and then
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:29.300]   get out at Camden, get out, like walk up from the canals and then you can go to Camden market.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.540]   But it's so, it's such a magical way.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.300]   England is a huge walking country.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.420]   Like all my friends in England, I went to a wedding and we, the next day after the wedding,
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.900]   they were like, well, should we walk back to London?
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.460]   And I was like, what?
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.620]   And we were in the middle of the countryside and they were like, yeah, you can just like
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.900]   walk along the Thames until you get to London.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.940]   And that's like what they do.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.380]   They're like all my friends, my British friends, they love to walk.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:55.660]   We get to somebody's family house and they're like, all right, should we go for a walk?
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.340]   And you can walk London in this really beautiful kind of hidden way.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.020]   You can see a lot of the houses from along the canals.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.820]   You can see all the boats in the canals.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.980]   Sometimes there's like a coffee shop on a houseboat in the canal.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.460]   There's a little bookshop on a houseboat in the canal.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:14.940]   Um, you walk through the zoo so you actually can see like bird cages and stuff in the zoo.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.840]   And then you get out at Camden market and go for a little shop, get some like nitrogen
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.180]   ice cream.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.220]   And that's a really fun thing to do.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.460]   And then I'm failing to remember the name of the bar, so I will give it to you and put
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.460]   it in the show notes.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:32.780]   But there's a bar right along the river that I believe is the oldest working wine bar either
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.680]   in the UK or all of Europe.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.980]   And you walk in and it's like dark stones and it's just a really cool vibe.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:40.980]   So that would be my place.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.220]   I would say to have a drink.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:43.220]   That is awesome.
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.220]   I have...
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.220]   My wife has not been to London.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.220]   Oh, you guys have to go.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.220]   One of the few...
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.140]   Your Syria with your husband for us is like London and Australia.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.140]   So they're high on the list.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:57.420]   Before we go though, where can people find everything you're doing online?
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.340]   So the first thing I would say is that if you're interested in Chris and hearing all
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:07.700]   of the hacks that he's ever learned in his life from the podcast and from beyond, you

[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.660]   Together.

[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.500]   takeaways as possible.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.580]   So you won't just sit back and be like, well, I learned a lot, but what am I going to actually
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.580]   do with that?
