[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.900]   I'd like to start off by just asking for all of us, are there some simple or perhaps not
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.080]   so simple questions that we can reflect on that give us a sense of, you know, how good
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.640]   a parent we are or would be based on, I don't know, our previous parent-child relationships,
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.600]   our relationship to self, you know, like what kind of things come to bear when we think
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.440]   about really healthy relationships?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.280]   I can, you know, start rattling off a list of what I imagine they could be.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.280]   But what are your thoughts?
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.800]   Like, what are the â€“ what's the parameter space, as we say?
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.640]   How should we think about relationships besides just, oh, you know, I either like this person
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.560]   or don't, or I feel good around them or I don't, or separating how I feel about them
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.200]   versus how they make me feel, you know, maybe we can drill a little deeper below the kind
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.560]   of more superficial stuff that we often see out there.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.480]   The first thing that comes to mind when you say that is this word "sturdiness."
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.920]   And to me, when someone says like what is good inside is an approach, and that's always
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.520]   the first word that comes to mind.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   And I know that's like an odd word.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.560]   It's not a word we like use a lot, although I do think most people when you say that person's
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.320]   like a really sturdy person, I think we all have some connotation or feeling at least
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.320]   of what that means.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.280]   And I use it a lot, being a sturdy parent, being a sturdy leader.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.480]   I talk a lot about the similarities to parenting and kind of being a pilot of a plane.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.080]   And that word "sturdy" always comes up.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.840]   And so I remember a little while ago, someone pushed me, they're like, what's your definition
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   of what that means?
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.160]   And at that point, I thought, wow, I should probably have a definition given I use it
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160]   a lot.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.700]   But what I think it really means is an ability to be connected to yourself and to someone
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.720]   else at the same time.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.160]   And I think that is really the definition of sturdy leadership.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.840]   And that is the key thing that's present in a healthy relationship, that at once I kind
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.120]   of know my values, what I want, what I need.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   I feel like I can be true to that.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.840]   And at the same time, I can kind of connect to someone else who probably has different
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.360]   wants and needs and maybe even slightly different values at the same time.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.560]   And the thing that that leads me to next is what I think about is like family jobs and
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.720]   a parent's job.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.560]   So in almost any other place, you could assume if I'm getting a new job at this company,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.800]   like there's just no way I could do my job well if I don't know what my job is, right?
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.840]   If you go to your desk and your boss is like, have a good day, do a good job, and there's
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.340]   no job description, you'd be like, I think that's impossible.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.080]   But over and over with parents, if I say to them, well, what is your job with your kid?
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.200]   Or when your kid is having a tantrum or they hit or they're rude or they lie to your face
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   or anything, what is your job in that moment?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640]   Most people, very well-intentioned, educated people who would never, ever take a job if
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.720]   they didn't have a job description, they look at me like, I have no idea.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.100]   So how can we do it well?
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.640]   How can we then perform it to a place to get to the outcomes we want if you don't have
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.400]   the foundation of what your job is?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.160]   And to me, I've thought a lot about it.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.240]   I think parents actually have two jobs, and it relates to sturdiness, so you'll connect
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   it where one of our jobs is boundaries.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.840]   And to me, boundaries are things we tell people we will do, and they require the other person
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   to do nothing.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   And that's really important, because a lot of times we think we're setting a boundary
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.040]   when actually we're making a request.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   And boundaries keep us connected to ourselves.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.800]   They represent our values and our wants and our needs.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.200]   And in a parent-child relationship, they also keep our kids safe.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.920]   I just know, in a simple way, my kids watched enough TV today, and they really have to get
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   to bed.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   And I know that.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.400]   I don't want them to stay up late.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.640]   I kind of know what my family needs.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   I have to set a boundary.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.020]   But the other part of my job is empathy and validation, which is a way of connecting to
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.460]   someone else, where you see someone else's feelings and experience as real.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.920]   You don't agree with it, probably.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.080]   You don't necessarily condone the behavior that's the representation of the feelings.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.160]   But the feelings themselves, you need to connect to.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.120]   And I feel like those are our two jobs as parents.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.520]   And that's really the way to be a sturdy leader and to be in a sturdy, healthy relationship
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   with your kids.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   Wow.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   So much there.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.680]   And I love it.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.080]   And here's one of the reasons I love it.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.240]   This notion of sturdiness, something that I don't think we hear enough about.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.600]   We hear about resilience, grit, also important terms.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.760]   But sturdiness, as you've described it in the job of parenting, really seems to include
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.240]   a lot of verbs, not just nouns and adjectives.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   And I'm a huge fan of verbs because biology and to some extent psychology, yes, also psychology,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   is all about verbs.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.040]   And so the labels often are mysterious.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.840]   But sturdiness just sends a clear message of something that doesn't budge easily.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.360]   But then as you describe the job of being a parent, having boundaries, and I'd like
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.440]   to drill into that a little bit more, how you view boundaries.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.280]   But also empathy, it's not a walled off picture.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.520]   It's one that is semi-permeable.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:27.420]   Also, and I confess I'm a bit obsessed with old school psychoanalytic theory, not as the
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.600]   be-all end-all of psychology, but it also suggests this other relationship.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.000]   Like I'm a person, I have a self, you're a person, you have a self.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.880]   This is the opposite of codependency, where obviously dependency and two people being
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.160]   "codependent" can be healthy in the context of relying on one another.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.520]   But as I understand it, when one person has a self and another person doesn't have a
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.840]   self or this notion of merging, not just in romantic relationships, but child-parent relationships,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   you know, I'm best friends with my mom or dad.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   Is that a good thing?
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   I don't know.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.960]   But this notion of other-other relationships, it's like I'm a self, you're a self, and
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.720]   we each see each other as another.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.600]   Anyway, I think there's so much to explore here, so valuable.
