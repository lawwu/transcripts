[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   So contempt is criticism on steroids.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.360]   This is what John Gottman calls sulfuric acid for love.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.720]   Nothing will erode a relationship quicker than contempt.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.220]   Contempt is when you are looking at your partner
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.120]   from a superior position.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.860]   So you are eye-rolling, you are name-calling.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.740]   There's a mockery, mocking, even physical mockery,
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.440]   imitating them, imitating their voice.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.620]   Contempt is meant to just take the legs out
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.820]   from your partner, make them feel pathetic, ridiculous.
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.180]   And it can be abusive,
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.600]   but most people have engaged in contempt
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000]   at some point in their relationship.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.280]   Lower level would be sort of the eye-rolling,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.640]   but that is the biggest predictor of a split.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.600]   - The following is a conversation with Shannon Curry,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600]   a clinical and forensic psychologist
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.640]   who conducts research, therapy,
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.580]   and psychological evaluations pertaining to trauma,
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.240]   violence, and relationships.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.080]   She received worldwide attention in April of last year
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.380]   by giving a lengthy televised testimony
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.800]   on her psychological evaluation of Amber Heard
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.640]   during the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.880]   I found her testimony to be an eloquent description
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.800]   of complex psychological concepts
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.060]   and evaluations procedures.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.800]   So I reached out for a chat.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.840]   In person, she was brilliant, funny,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.400]   thoughtful, and truly kind.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.000]   I really, really enjoyed this conversation.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.160]   in the description.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.420]   And now, dear friends, here's Shannon Curry.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.360]   Charles Bukowski said that love is a fog
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.820]   that burns away with the first daylight of reality.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.200]   I love that quote.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.920]   Do you think romantic love fades away in this way?
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.760]   - Bukowski.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.780]   - Does it have to fade?
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.160]   - The truth is that you have all of these chemicals
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.320]   pumping through your body.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.860]   You're essentially high on heroin
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.720]   in the beginning of a romance.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.960]   And you're going to have these rose-colored glasses on.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.700]   Everything your partner does is magical.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.200]   But really, it's the novelty.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.580]   It's just like going on a vacation.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.780]   You're fully present.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.440]   You're just attuned to the magic
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   of another human being moment to moment.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.200]   And then on top of that, you're just flooded with dopamine.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.760]   So you're high on drugs.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.600]   And we can't go on like that.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.120]   You will die if you are using these kinds of chemicals
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.040]   all the time, all day long.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.340]   So eventually, our bodies are sort of made
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.500]   to dial it down.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.340]   We've made it.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.700]   I mean, we're evolutionary beings.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.820]   We are doing the same thing we did 200,000 years ago
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.400]   to find a mate, procreate,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.320]   spend enough time with each other that we have sex
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.060]   a whole bunch of times and make babies.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.960]   Now we've changed the rules of the game.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.860]   We're living almost till we're 100 years old.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.820]   In some cases, we're making these marriage commitments
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.900]   that last half a century.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.780]   And we're expecting it to be all because of love.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.340]   And we're signing these contracts based on how we feel
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.420]   when we're high on these drugs.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.220]   So the reality is we know based on the...
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.580]   And I'm also talking about
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.420]   certain Western civilizations here,
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.460]   because as you know, there are range marriages.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.780]   And a lot of times, those marriages,
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.460]   if we're looking at longevity,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.660]   are actually way more satisfied
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.620]   than people who are marrying for love,
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.840]   which logically makes sense.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   If you're making a decision based on a feeling
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.080]   that is basically based on endorphins
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.700]   and dopamine and oxytocin,
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.940]   I wouldn't sign a contract just because of a feeling
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.880]   necessarily for 50 years.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.320]   Whereas an arranged marriage,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.700]   if you have your elders kind of deciding for you
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.960]   that this partner has a bunch of traits
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.580]   that you're going to appreciate more and more over time,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.540]   I think there's some wisdom there.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.540]   - So you don't think that feeling could be a foundation
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.020]   for a 50-year relationship?
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.740]   - Well, I don't think that specific feeling
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.460]   you're having based on drugs
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.540]   is going to be the same feeling you have
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.780]   20, 30, 40 years down the line.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.980]   If you're gonna wake up and turn to your partner
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.020]   when you're 70 and think,
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.940]   "Oh my God, I'm so glad you're hot.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.600]   "You are so hot,"
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.700]   then sure, marry for hotness.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.660]   But if you've been through life a little bit,
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.820]   and I think most people who are on a second marriage know,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.300]   shit happens in life.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.740]   It is hard.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.580]   You're gonna have maybe a kid with special needs,
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.540]   or your dad gets dementia,
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.140]   or you get diagnosed with cancer.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.800]   Who are you gonna wanna come home to?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.420]   Who is going to hold you when you are sobbing on the floor
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.580]   and tell you, "We're gonna get through it together"?
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.740]   Who's gonna know the names of your kid's special ed teacher
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.340]   and the process for getting a 504 plan?
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.940]   Or is it gonna be you on your own?
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.180]   I think those things matter.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.300]   - But doesn't that hotness,
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.900]   don't those drugs kind of solidify
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.540]   into a deeper appreciation of the other person,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.220]   into something you could call beauty?
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.380]   - Yes, they can.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.740]   - But isn't that the same thing?
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.260]   When you notice the beauty of another human being,
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.660]   aren't you high on drugs still?
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.380]   You're making it sound like there's a brief rockstar period
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.300]   of going on heroin and then it's over,
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.660]   but can't you be on heroin your whole life?
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.700]   - I have some good news.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.740]   I have some good news.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.900]   That was something, I think one of the reasons
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.140]   I got into studying relationships
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.140]   was because I wanted that, right?
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.580]   So I'm a scientist, but I also love art
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.780]   and I love writing and I love literature.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.560]   I wanted to know that true love could be real,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.300]   but as a scientist, I am cynical.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.100]   I just need some data.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.180]   And so I practice a type of therapy
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.500]   called the Gottman Method.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.860]   And I love that because it tends to be,
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.020]   well, it is one of the most evidence-based therapies
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.020]   we have based on John and Julie Gottman,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.100]   two psychologists who have been researching relationships
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.100]   for now about 50 years.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.300]   And this therapy happens to be for couples.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.380]   They found that you absolutely
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.340]   can make longevity work in a relationship.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.700]   You can build, you are not just settling for companionship,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.300]   but you can have passion and intimacy
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.700]   and growing love and appreciation.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.900]   But there is a blueprint, a set of skills
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.940]   that we were never given.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.580]   We're not taught it in school.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.940]   We changed the rules of the game
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.260]   and we haven't learned the rules yet.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.060]   - And the Gottman Method for couples therapy
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.820]   kind of gives you a few guidelines,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.100]   the rules for longevity in a relationship.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.700]   - Yeah, they did a beautiful job
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.540]   at taking these findings they had
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.060]   through decades of research,
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.900]   quantifying it and then codifying it into a therapy method.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.340]   It's really skills-based.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.540]   I tell couples when they're starting out with me
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.180]   that they're essentially gonna be starting a class.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.420]   - So what's the five to one golden rule?
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.780]   What I read is there's a kind of balance you can achieve
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780]   of how many interactions you have in a relationship
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.540]   that are positive versus negative.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.700]   And I think that's what the five to one means.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.620]   But basically there should be kind of an empirical,
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.860]   if you just look back over a month,
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.500]   how many of the interactions are positive,
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.860]   how many are negative? - Or the day.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.620]   - Or the day, right?
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.260]   So the idea of this ratio, well, it's not an idea.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.220]   It was a finding.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.500]   It is a research finding that the Gottmans got
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.580]   after looking at thousands of couples
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.820]   and codifying these interactions that they were observing.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.820]   Couples that tend to be satisfied in their relationships
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.940]   that are happier, they have better health, et cetera,
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.860]   they are having approximately five positive interactions
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.460]   to each negative.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.580]   And I wanna be clear about what I'm defining
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.980]   as positive and negative here.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.020]   So this doesn't necessarily mean that you're,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.660]   these don't need to be big sweeping romantic gestures,
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.860]   buying flowers, having sex.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.020]   These are things like paying attention
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.260]   to what we call your partner's bids.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.060]   We make these bids for affection, for connection
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.740]   all the time in our relationships,
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.620]   not just with our partners, but with our friends,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.020]   our coworkers.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.140]   And we may not even know what our style of bid is,
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.460]   but if you see them on a sheet,
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.420]   you can pretty quickly identify them.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.060]   Bids could be wanting to show your partner
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.300]   or tell your partner something
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.020]   and have them be proud of you.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.700]   It could be wanting to go buy groceries with your partner,
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.620]   doing things together.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.940]   Hey, you wanna come with me?
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.580]   It could be telling a joke and hoping that your wife
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.580]   looks up from her email on the computer and acknowledges it.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.220]   If she laughs, then you've got a positive.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.980]   But if I don't even look up, that's a negative, right?
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.100]   So it's not necessarily that I'm calling my husband
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.380]   an asshole, it's just, am I connecting with him?
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.380]   Am I meeting those bids for connection and vice versa?
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.940]   - But do those also give you a guide
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.180]   of how you should behave?
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.260]   - Well, I think what's really important
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.580]   is actually asking your partner
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.180]   or paying attention to what your partner's bids are,
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.060]   because what matters to Ty, my husband,
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.300]   may not matter to you.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.220]   For instance, I mean, Ty's bar is so low with me.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.540]   I thank God for him.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.740]   - In terms of what defines a positive interaction?
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.380]   - Right, like he just wants me to ask him
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.140]   if he wants a water when I get up to get myself one.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.900]   Just be a basic, decent, considerate person
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.020]   is all he asks of me.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.700]   Whereas mine might be sort of like,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.580]   stay up later with me, watch a show,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.300]   go to bed at the same time as me,
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.220]   or know about the people in my life,
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.620]   that sort of a thing.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.660]   - I should highlight this, and I hope hopefully it's okay,
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.580]   that you were running a little bit late,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.300]   and you sent me this text,
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.660]   which people do really rarely,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.100]   and there's a subtle act of kindness within that text.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.100]   So the text you sent was that I just decreased
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.100]   the amount of stress in your life or something like this
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.500]   by saying it's cool.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   But that means that you're signaling that you were stressed
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.620]   because you care enough to be there on time.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.500]   And that made me feel really special.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.500]   I was like, oh, people don't always do that,
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.500]   because that makes you vulnerable.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.340]   - Vulnerable.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.380]   I actually thought that after I sent it,
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.100]   but I feel that most of the day.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.700]   Any interaction, like, God, I just expose myself.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.780]   But absolutely, I was excited to be here,
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.020]   and I didn't want you to think that I didn't care.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.620]   I think being a therapist has shown me
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.620]   that it's so lucky to be in that position,
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.380]   because you meet people that you would have thought
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.420]   are cooler than you or smarter than you
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.940]   or just somehow impervious to life,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.140]   and you realize that we are all in it together.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.540]   We all want to be cared about and liked.
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.380]   We all would wanna be liked as a baseline.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.300]   Some people will say they don't care,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.460]   but everybody does.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.180]   It's human.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.820]   And I have gotten much better being a therapist,
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.900]   much more comfortable showing caring, showing love,
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.860]   and genuineness and vulnerability
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.700]   than I think I ever would have been otherwise.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.740]   - And that kind of vulnerability is what's required
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.580]   to do a positive interaction in a relationship?
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.500]   - I think so.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.060]   And people have different levels of comfort, right?
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.420]   So, but as long as it's working for both partners,
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.540]   and typically you have to communicate
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.660]   to figure out what your partner,
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.300]   what makes your partner feel cared about.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.620]   However, you might be working, for instance,
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.700]   with an older couple,
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.420]   and I have a couple that's perfectly happy,
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.820]   and they sort of have a system.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.180]   It works for them.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.180]   If there's some sort of a rupture,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.060]   if they get in some sort of a disagreement,
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.420]   they don't talk it out.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.740]   She might go to the store, run an errand,
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.020]   do a little shopping.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.660]   He'll work in the wood shop,
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.020]   and then they'll come back,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.260]   and there is a repair attempt, though,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.940]   but it's maybe she'll say,
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.340]   "Hey, do you wanna have dinner?
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.860]   "I made your favorite dinner."
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.940]   Or he'll say, "Hey, I recorded your favorite show.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.300]   "You wanna watch it tonight?"
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.940]   So they don't need to process it,
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.860]   but there is an understanding between them
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.220]   that we're still in this together,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.660]   we care about each other,
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.740]   and there's a repair attempt.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.420]   Most people need to be able to process it verbally
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.620]   and talk about what happened, but not all.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.700]   - So for most people, if there's a conflict,
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.460]   you should talk about it and resolve it and repair it,
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.180]   versus just put it behind you?
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.820]   - I don't wanna say should.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.020]   I guess it depends on the couple.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.340]   Everybody processes emotions differently.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.980]   Everybody handles emotional expression differently.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.820]   I mean, I have couples where I have one person
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.420]   in the partnership who has autism and the other doesn't,
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.340]   and so they're obviously going to have different ways
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.060]   of communicating or processing what happened.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.180]   We all have different perspectives.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.260]   It really depends on what makes a person
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.980]   feel like it's been repaired.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.980]   What makes a person feel understood?
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.340]   Does that need to be verbal?
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.660]   Or in the case of that older couple I have
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.180]   where they know they understand one another
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.900]   because there's a gentleness toward one another after.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.180]   - What are some common ways relationships fail
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.860]   that you've observed in all the therapy you've done?
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.540]   - Well, the Gommons identified what they call
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.380]   So--
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.460]   - Okay, what are the four horsemen?
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.180]   - I mean, I could just keep it simple
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.700]   and go off their research.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.140]   So those are four different behaviors
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.980]   that they identify in couples,
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.980]   or that you can identify in couples
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.140]   that are really highly predictive of a divorce,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.180]   some more than others,
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.700]   but I'll start with the lower ones.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.780]   So one thing that we, by the way, actually,
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.780]   we all do these things.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.740]   These would be in that five to one ratio.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.580]   You'd wanna stay away from some of these.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.420]   These are the ones.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.180]   So as they pile up, now that ratio is gonna get imbalanced
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.860]   and then you are headed for a split, okay?
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.140]   So the first is criticism.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.700]   So criticism is when we have a complaint,
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.820]   complaints are normal,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.180]   but instead of owning our own problems, our own feelings,
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.700]   we assume that our perspective
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.180]   is the only valid, accurate perspective.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.660]   And so we take it upon ourselves
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.820]   to tell our partner what is wrong with them, okay?
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.620]   So there's essentially no real belief
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.100]   that they might have a valid perspective too.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.140]   So this could look like,
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.620]   you never helped me out with the house,
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.700]   or even you're so lazy,
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.660]   like can't I just get you for five seconds
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.100]   to help with the kids or something like that?
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.460]   And then what happens is horseman number two, defensiveness.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.340]   So not everybody is defensive
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.860]   just because they were criticized.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.060]   Some people just are more prone to defensiveness than others.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.900]   None of us really like admitting our faults.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.940]   So it's pretty natural,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.300]   but defensiveness is essentially making excuses or worse,
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.000]   turning it around on your partner,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.860]   not accepting any responsibility
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.620]   and definitely not validating what they're feeling.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.060]   Now, if you get criticized enough,
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.820]   or if you get really flooded,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.540]   the flooding is what happens when our heart rate goes up
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.620]   kind of around 100 beats per minute,
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.160]   our frontal lobe shuts down.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.300]   That's our thoughtful brain, our logical brain,
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.260]   and our reptilian kind of hind brain takes over our thinking
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.580]   and we just go into fight or flight in a way.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.420]   We just wanna annihilate our partner
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.580]   instead of say anything
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.700]   that would be helpful to the relationship.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.220]   So if you're getting flooded,
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.300]   you could do a couple of things.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.900]   You could get super critical, you could get contemptuous,
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.380]   which I'll talk about in a second, it's the last horseman,
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.160]   or you do the third horseman, which is stonewalling.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.140]   And in their research, the Gottmans found
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.040]   that men are actually more likely to stonewall.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.300]   I also am someone who stonewalls,
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.300]   but it's where you just sort of disconnect
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.880]   from the conversation.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.420]   You shut down, you turn away,
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.940]   you can physically even turn away, kind of arms crossed,
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.860]   but you're just, you're shut off.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.220]   And stonewalling happens usually because you get flooded,
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.500]   you feel like you can't win,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   you don't know what to do to make the situation better.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.340]   It feels pretty hopeless and talking feels unproductive.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.380]   So you can see how in a typical heterosexual relationship,
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.700]   the gender dynamic, we know that women
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.780]   tend to use criticism more often
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.620]   because they're the ones
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.260]   that typically raise issues verbally.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.420]   And then if men are feeling more criticized,
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.220]   that they tend to stonewall,
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.820]   and it becomes this vicious cycle of then more criticism,
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.860]   but the criticism is really just a plea to be loved
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.300]   and get your partner to show you they care.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.180]   And then the man tends to feel
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.840]   like he can't do anything right.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.920]   This isn't even productive.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.660]   If I say anything, I'm just gonna make it worse.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.300]   And they don't have any real,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.140]   you haven't given them a specific need, a solution,
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.100]   something they can do to shine for you.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.420]   So they turn away.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   - And where does the contempt come in?
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.080]   - All right, so contempt is criticism on steroids.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.020]   This is what John Gottman calls sulfuric acid for love.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.380]   Nothing will erode a relationship quicker than contempt.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.900]   Contempt is when you are looking at your partner
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.780]   from a superior position.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.520]   So you are eye-rolling, you are name-calling.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.420]   There's a mockery, mocking, even physical mockery,
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.140]   imitating them, imitating their voice.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.320]   Contempt is meant to just take the legs out
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.520]   from your partner, make them feel pathetic, ridiculous.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.880]   And it can be abusive,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.300]   but most people have engaged in contempt
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.700]   at some point in their relationship.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.980]   Lower level would be sort of the eye-rolling,
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.700]   but that is the biggest predictor of a split.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.700]   - If you allow yourself to think,
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.660]   yeah, that mockery or contempt just a little bit,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.700]   it's like this weird, slippery slope.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.580]   - It sure is.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.980]   - And the opposite is true,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.020]   where I just look at a person and think,
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.740]   wow, isn't that the most wonderful creature
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.060]   I've ever seen in my life?
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.100]   Like, just think that.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.620]   And you notice the little details about who they are.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.220]   That's why I just observe them the way you observe
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.340]   a weird peacock at a zoo or something like that.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.940]   - Intention is powerful, isn't it?
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.500]   - Yeah, and it changes.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.260]   You start to notice beautiful things
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.900]   and then let the things that annoy you--
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.180]   - Yes.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.100]   You're exactly right.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.700]   You're touching on some really important things.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.380]   So in relationships, we actually know
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.380]   that wearing rose-colored glasses is important.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.220]   It's healthy.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.860]   We need it.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.820]   And it's a choice you're making, right?
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.540]   So there is a saying that getting married
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.940]   is just choosing one person's faults over another.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.940]   And the reality is that we may become infatuated
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.500]   with somebody else as human beings.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   Love is an emotion.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.300]   Attraction is an emotion.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.540]   And as you go through life,
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.700]   even if you're in a committed relationship,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.580]   you might see beauty in another.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.340]   And that person who is novel might seem attractive to you.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.960]   But if you can remember that they too have a set of problems
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.860]   that you would be marrying,
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.580]   it really helps you to see the beauty in your partner again
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.220]   and recognize all of their incredible strengths
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.020]   and all the ways we meld with a person
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.780]   and become our own family, almost become...
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.940]   I mean, our lives intertwine and we grow those oak trees.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.780]   - So to you, by the way,
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.260]   there's a line I read somewhere
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.860]   that when you're wearing rose-colored glasses,
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.740]   all the red flags look just like flags.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.420]   (Bridget laughs)
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.420]   I think it's a good line. - I love that.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.340]   - So you think that humans are fundamentally,
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.860]   all of us are fundamentally flawed or have flaws.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.060]   They're unique flaws.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.180]   And basically, relationships is just a way to,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.420]   figure out how the two can fit together.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.620]   - Right, and we're different.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.420]   So no matter what, we're going to have differences.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.420]   We are raised differently than our partner.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.820]   We have different stories,
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.020]   different experiences that shaped our value systems,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.980]   especially when it comes to the big ones
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.040]   like parenting, love, money,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.220]   these principles that are based in our history.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.300]   We're gonna have differences.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.860]   So is this a set of differences
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.900]   you can accept from somebody and work with?
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.820]   Do the benefits and do their strengths,
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.900]   do they make it worth it?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.620]   Or are they deal-breaker differences?
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.580]   - Tricky question. - Sure.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.300]   - But in the couples you've worked with,
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.820]   is there, like the feminine and the masculine,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.900]   is there different dynamics that come into play,
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.460]   like dominant and submissive?
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.700]   Is it like a dance where it just changes
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.900]   from minute to minute?
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.980]   Is there dynamics that you observe
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.980]   that both limit and enable successful relationships?
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.100]   - Yes, so there are,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.500]   if we're talking about masculine/feminine,
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.460]   then how also we could get into,
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.580]   are we talking about actual gender, identified gender,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.300]   or are we just talking about these traits?
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.820]   Because like I said, I stonewall,
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.860]   which is typically in couples,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.640]   something that is more associated with straight men.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.540]   But that's my style of coping when I get overwhelmed.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.140]   That is not tied to any sort of success
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.180]   or non-success of a relationship.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.820]   But what we do know is that gay couples,
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.260]   so lesbians and gay men,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.140]   tend to be gentler with one another
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.440]   when they are having conflict discussions.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.260]   So that's actually been identified in the research,
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.540]   and it's something I've witnessed,
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.380]   and it's just fascinating.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.500]   So with my straight couples,
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.420]   I'll be going through one of these,
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.500]   if we're processing a conflict that occurred,
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.980]   I'll be going through the sheet,
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.420]   and it's very, very structured,
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.700]   because you don't want couples doing more damage
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.540]   when they're there with you.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.580]   You want them practicing skills
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.100]   that protect them from criticism,
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.040]   that protect them from contempt.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.620]   And when I'm working with a straight couple,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.700]   I am like a referee,
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.860]   or sometimes I'll relate it to being like a ski coach
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.660]   and keeping people on a bunny hill,
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.500]   and you let them make like two turns,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.780]   and then you stop them,
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.780]   and you meet up again
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.680]   because you don't want them to veer off.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.420]   With straight couples, you are doing very short turns
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.500]   before you need to kind of intervene and rescaffold.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.580]   I had a lesbian couple recently,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.440]   and they were so lovely with each other.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.620]   They skipped like seven steps
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.540]   to the advanced final portion
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.460]   where they were already coming up with solutions
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.860]   and suggesting things
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.120]   that they might be able to do differently next time
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.720]   to make it better for their partner.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.660]   They were asking each other questions
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.220]   about how their partner felt with no agenda,
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.340]   no attempt to sort of be like,
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.780]   well, do you think you're feeling that way
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.440]   because, which straight couples do all the time,
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.220]   you just see this humility and openness.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.140]   It's lovely.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.380]   - Yeah, it's lovely,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.500]   but I wonder if maybe watching too many Hollywood films,
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.300]   if some of the drama,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.660]   some of the tension is required
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.100]   for a passionate, lifelong romance.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.060]   - No, it's not, and that's great news.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.500]   So we actually know
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.660]   that the closer you feel to your partner,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.220]   so if, I mean, you've talked a lot about beauty,
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.220]   and you can ignite that beauty, that interest, right?
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.820]   So when you're falling in love,
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.380]   it's usually that a person is sort of a mystery to you,
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.860]   and you're uncovering these layers
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.400]   that you find really appealing.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.660]   There are continual layers
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.820]   that you can uncover with your partner over time.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.300]   I don't think we realize that.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.780]   I think we get complacent,
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.140]   and we think we've had every conversation imaginable.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.180]   What else are they gonna do to surprise me?
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.420]   But we don't know the questions to be asking.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.240]   One of my favorite questions,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.020]   I like turning these conversations kind of into a quiz
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.020]   because I get bored easily.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.300]   So rather than just asking an open-ended question,
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.280]   there's a way you can do this with your partner
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.420]   where it's sort of like the dating game.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.220]   Like, what is my as of yet fondest,
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.580]   but unrealized life dream?
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.720]   And see if your partner knows.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.140]   You might not even know.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.180]   They might know you better than you know yourself.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.460]   That in and of itself is a beautiful reminder
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.260]   of the relationship and how special it is.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:06.260]   But then also, when they say it,
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.580]   or when you realize or have to think critically,
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.740]   like, what is my husband's as of yet unrealized,
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.960]   but fondest life dream?
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.580]   And then you can talk about it.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.620]   You just, I don't know,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.660]   you just kind of transcend into this new area,
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.140]   and you feel tight again.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.220]   You feel like, you feel close.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.900]   - Well, you really talk to each other.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.460]   Like, I've recorded,
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.700]   and without intending to publish,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.540]   podcasts like this with microphones,
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.340]   with friends, with people close to me.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.020]   'Cause it's literally that.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.340]   You get to ask questions, like as if it's an interview.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.180]   - Right.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.340]   - And we don't do that-- - That's exactly it.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.420]   The way you're talking with me.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.860]   Sit down with your partner, have that conversation.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.020]   - Like years later.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.940]   - Right, show interest, actually be curious.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.940]   See what they surprise you with.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.140]   - And actually, what you learn
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.180]   is you don't know the answers to most of these questions.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.460]   - 100%, exactly.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.620]   - Like, what's your favorite movie from the '80s?
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.180]   You might not know the answer to that.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.340]   It's like those first date questions or whatever.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.740]   - Or what's your favorite movie this year, and why?
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.140]   - And why, yeah.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.300]   It's fascinating.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.140]   - It is.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.960]   - It's hard to do that,
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.260]   because I think that you'll probably be offended at first,
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.340]   how little the other person knows.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.300]   So I think you have to work through that.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.420]   - You know, I actually find that there's this rekindling,
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.960]   because partners are shocked
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.240]   that their partner does know so much about them.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.660]   Especially if they've been feeling
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.700]   dissatisfied or disconnected,
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.340]   it's a reminder of all the good that's still there.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.340]   - What, I know we've said some of those things,
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.080]   but what's on the opposite side?
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.820]   What's the key to a successful relationship?
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.500]   What's like, what are the things you see time and time again
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.020]   that you designate that they're on a good path?
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.940]   - Yeah, there's a real attunement, honestly.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.700]   Just, it's sort of an us against the world feeling.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.740]   Nobody, neither partner's gonna talk shit on the other.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.860]   There's a loyalty.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.620]   They handle each other in the relationship with care.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.300]   You can tell that they've worked some things.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.900]   To me, it usually indicates that these are some people
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.700]   who have figured, they've had to work some things out.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.500]   They know that this is delicate.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.740]   They know that you're on thin ice.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.580]   You take a wrong step and you can be back
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.180]   in a tough place in your relationship.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.140]   Or you treat it with care and it can be amazing.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.380]   So they're careful with one another.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.440]   They give each other compliments.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.460]   They are considerate.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.700]   So you'll see, he'll bring the car around for her
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.660]   because it's raining.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.540]   Or she'll bring him home some takeout.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.740]   She'll order for him too at the restaurant.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.740]   They keep each other in each other's minds.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.760]   - But that us against the world thing,
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.660]   that definitely is there.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.220]   - 100%, you've seen that, right?
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.380]   - Yeah, you've seen it.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.220]   And you've seen it, I like it when couples
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.580]   have been together for a long time
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.580]   and when one is talking, the other one looks at them.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.340]   If you don't do that, that's not a bad sign,
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.340]   but it's a good sign when you do that.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:14.340]   And I think it's actually a really good exercise to do
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.420]   because I enjoy when I see in others.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:25.020]   It's a way to show that you don't take him for granted
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.960]   and that you still find them this mysterious,
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.520]   wonderful creature to observe.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.140]   I think too often, we have that with our parents,
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.980]   we have that with people close to us.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.060]   You think, yeah, I've heard what they're about to say.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.700]   I know, I know, you can complete that sentence.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.540]   - Yeah, take him for granted.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.460]   - And then if you just look at them and say,
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.980]   wow, this is the most brilliant person
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.900]   I've ever seen in my life.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.900]   I can't just appreciate every word that comes out of them
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.260]   and look at them in that way,
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.020]   you actually begin to believe it
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.860]   and you actually begin to see the beauty
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.680]   of what they're saying.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.660]   - You are exactly right, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.940]   - And they feel really good. - And it's caring, yeah.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.060]   It's very caring.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.520]   I mean, that's, I think, the beauty
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.800]   of what the Gottman research showed us,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.120]   taught us, provided us,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.040]   is that we can do these things that become cyclic
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.000]   and just keep growing this relationship,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.120]   making it stronger, more powerful, more loving.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.440]   You would never want to cut it down.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.400]   - Well, you were talking about the sheet
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.500]   for conflict processing.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.340]   What are we talking about?
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.320]   So like a couple will come and say,
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.040]   like there was this conflict and you put it on the table
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.360]   and then what does it mean to process it?
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.760]   - Well, so in that Gottman method of therapy,
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.220]   there are all these different,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.120]   I mean, hundreds of different interventions
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.560]   and based on what the issue is in that session,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.400]   you can decide the most appropriate intervention.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.720]   And so this is a specific intervention
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.900]   for if it is a conflict that occurred
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.240]   and there are different types of conflicts.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.740]   So this would be more like an incident.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.920]   It's not a perpetual recurring problem,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.960]   which has actually a different intervention
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.360]   where you kind of look at the underlying
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.960]   belief systems values and there's,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.520]   the goal is not to solve that problem.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.680]   The goal in that situation is to actually
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.720]   just get a better understanding of each other
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.160]   and your positions and just,
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   you stop seeing your partner as the adversary
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.080]   and you start seeing them as a person who makes sense.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.560]   But if there's been a specific event,
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.440]   a specific fight that's just sort of situational,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.000]   but it's left bad blood,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.280]   things were said or you didn't feel understood,
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.400]   this intervention I was talking about
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.920]   is one that you would go through a series of steps
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.140]   where first you identify the emotions that you were feeling.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:47.140]   Then you describe play by play your movie, your perspective.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.320]   If your partner were looking through your eyes,
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.220]   this is what they heard, saw, thought,
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.040]   then they saw this, then they heard this.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.960]   So you're not saying, yeah,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.120]   then you came in and were yelling and acting crazy.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.000]   You're saying, so then I saw you come in,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.920]   I heard you say, and I thought to myself,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.760]   well, great, now everything's ruined, right?
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.440]   So you're showing them your movie.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.880]   Then they have to summarize the movie for you
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.960]   and then vice versa.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.000]   And then there's this step where each person
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.960]   validates some part that they can understand.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.280]   Like based on what you saw, heard,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.640]   I can actually understand how you felt
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.960]   one of those feelings that you said.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.280]   Then my favorite part is you rewind sort of the movie
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.240]   from that day back through into childhood
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.920]   and you land on a time, a memory,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.520]   when you felt a similar set of feelings.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.800]   And this is like the most beautiful part ever
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.680]   because let's say the feeling was I felt misunderstood,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.680]   I felt misjudged, uncared about, unloved,
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.400]   like you didn't even like me.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.200]   And I'll say, when did you feel that way?
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.160]   Land on a time and they're like, my whole childhood.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.200]   My parents were, my mom was always accusing me
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.560]   of doing things I wasn't doing and it would set me up
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.440]   and my dad would come home, he'd hear about it,
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.000]   he would just believe her.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.400]   And then you have like a partner climbing up on the couch,
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.760]   like give their partner a hug
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   while they're sharing the story.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.160]   And it changes the way you interact in future disagreements.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.080]   - So you have those moments.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.840]   - Yeah, you can't unlearn.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.320]   Now you know this about your partner,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.080]   you know what they're sensitive to.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.000]   - Yeah, and again, you kind of see the beauty
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.120]   in the flaws then.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.960]   - Right.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.000]   - And you--
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.600]   - It all makes sense, right?
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.560]   - It all kind of makes sense.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.120]   - Yeah, so you maybe were in this dumpster dive
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.760]   in your head of how your partner sucks
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.160]   and all the things that are wrong with them
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.400]   and it's so hopeless.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.440]   And then you get this light shining through
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.960]   and you realize, oh my God,
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.160]   of course they would be sensitive to that.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.840]   And suddenly it's not about all the ways
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.040]   your partner is wrong and proving that they're wrong,
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.400]   it's just how can I in the future make sure
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.960]   they do not feel this again?
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.800]   I would never want this person I love
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.240]   to misunderstand me and feel so unloved.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.080]   - What are you, the early days of that,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.280]   what do you think about the whole dating,
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.440]   modern dating process?
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.920]   How do you find a partner that you can
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.720]   stay with for the rest of your life?
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.080]   - So we are absolutely doing it wrong.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.360]   But there is a way you can do it.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.280]   And I am such a fan of the psychologist Ty Tashiro.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.320]   I adore him.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.760]   He's brilliant, he's lovely,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.920]   he's also very humble,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.640]   just a wonderful salt of the earth guy.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.800]   I'm gonna tell you a very true story here, okay?
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.160]   I was in a bad relationship
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.680]   and I was at a psychology conference
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.200]   with my partner at the time.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.960]   We were both at this conference
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.920]   and we were sitting in a lecture hall
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.960]   there for Ty Tashiro to do his talk that day
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.100]   on his phenomenal research
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.840]   on relationship satisfaction and dating.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.800]   And I was sitting next to him and we'd been,
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.440]   it was just always unpleasant on trips,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.760]   there were always fights.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.720]   We're sitting there and Ty Tashiro starts talking about
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   his research and how he found that most people
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.800]   are signing this agreement, getting married,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.720]   and doing it based on the love endorphins.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.000]   And really only about 35% of anybody who's married
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.400]   is actually happy.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.200]   And he said, so then, you know--
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.120]   - That's a pretty low number.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.520]   - Exactly, but here's what I love about Ty Tashiro
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.760]   is he didn't stop there.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.160]   He wanted to know what those people who were happy
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.080]   had in common.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   And then same thing with the people who were unhappy.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.720]   He found a couple fascinating patterns.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.480]   So the couples who were happy
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.200]   tended to rate their partners higher
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.920]   in three different traits.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.440]   And I love talking about this
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.400]   because if you are somebody who can follow instructions,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.960]   you can find this, I mean, very easily.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.720]   Those three traits tend to be conscientiousness, okay?
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.080]   And I love the word conscientiousness
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.480]   because it's not just kindness.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.160]   Kindness is a good way to think of it,
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.320]   but you can be kind and kind of be a pushover
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.720]   and that's not attractive.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.640]   Conscientiousness is smart, attentive.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.680]   It's somebody who reads into a text message and thinks,
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.040]   wow, she was making herself very vulnerable there.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.320]   That's conscientiousness.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.880]   - I like how you just threw in a compliment.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.160]   I appreciate it. - It's true.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.200]   It's a certain intelligence, awareness, and attunement.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.680]   And then on top of that, conscientiousness is motivated.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.280]   So you can't be on your ass all day and be conscientious
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.400]   'cause then you can't meet the needs
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.240]   that you anticipate about the person.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.000]   So conscientious is that guy who drives the car around
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.400]   in the rainstorm so his wife's hair doesn't get met.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.160]   It's my husband who checks my alarm for me every morning
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.080]   'cause he knows I'm terrible at time management
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.400]   and he makes sure that I set it a reasonable amount of time
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.800]   before my first meeting
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.120]   and not the 20 minutes I think I need.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.960]   And then he'll come wake me up with a cup of coffee.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.720]   That is ultimate conscientiousness.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.800]   And it is true.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.400]   I mean, I will tell you,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.080]   as somebody who's with a conscientious partner,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.840]   your love increases over time
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.880]   as you continue to feel grateful
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.520]   and admiring of that person.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.320]   The second one, you want somebody who is low
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.560]   in a big five personality trait called neuroticism.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.520]   You want somebody emotionally stable in a way.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.920]   Now this doesn't mean you can't have somebody
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.080]   who doesn't get the blues
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.560]   or struggle with mental health issues.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.680]   Trust me, Ty is with somebody who,
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.480]   you know, I'm all over the place.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.400]   But you want somebody who kind of owns their shit
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   and isn't going to just be emotionally unstable all over.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.240]   You know, you want somebody who is generally happy
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.000]   and has some life satisfaction.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.440]   Having a partner who has serious,
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.840]   not mental health issues,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.760]   but unmitigated emotional distress and instability
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.240]   is really hard on the partner.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.920]   And it's really hard on other family members,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.040]   including children, if you have children.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.880]   So it's just a predictor of happiness.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.520]   - There's a certain threshold of chaos
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.680]   that if you exceed it,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.720]   it's going to be destructive to a long-term relationship.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.200]   - A perfect description.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.920]   - But then again-- - About chaos.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.680]   Not the mystery chaos you love
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.160]   with your little poet brain.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.400]   I'm talking more like just somebody who,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.240]   there's just no peace.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.080]   There's no peace.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.320]   There's a problem with everything.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.960]   Everything becomes more difficult.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.360]   Going to a party is a chore.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.680]   You don't know if they're gonna have a meltdown at the party
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.160]   or how many complaints about your friends
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.000]   or everything is a problem.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.600]   So you want somebody who has just some resiliency,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.800]   I think is a good term for it, some flexibility.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.760]   - Some spice is okay, but not too much.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.520]   - Right, flexibility, resiliency, easygoing.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:04.480]   The third is really interesting, I think.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.280]   So he found that having a partner
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.440]   with sort of moderate adventurousness,
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.720]   not high adventurousness,
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.240]   actually leads to greater satisfaction.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.120]   And the reason for that is high adventurousness
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.960]   equals novelty seeking, shiny new things.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.000]   And so if you're in a monogamous relationship,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.240]   if that is what's important to you,
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.680]   it's going to be very hard for a partner
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.320]   who is novelty seeking to be faithful.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.920]   So that will cause a lot of pain.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   But also, novelty seeking people
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.640]   tend to always have new projects, new interesting things,
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.440]   and so their attention is drawn away from the relationship.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.840]   And so you can just feel pretty neglected or unimportant.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.080]   - But a little bit.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.720]   - But you want a little bit of adventurousness.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.920]   So you want your person to be sort of self-motivated,
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.680]   individuated, have their own interests,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.320]   not completely dependent on you.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.400]   But also, I mean, low adventurousness is not a bad thing.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.440]   Ultimately, what you're getting
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.960]   with low to moderate adventurousness is that rock,
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.040]   that feeling of stability, that home.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   And I made some references earlier,
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.280]   like when you're 70 and you turn to your partner,
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.760]   do you want him to be hot?
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.400]   Or, for instance, my dad has dementia right now.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.040]   And my husband turned to me on the plane,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.480]   we were all coming back from a trip
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.640]   and where we really saw how severe it's getting.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.520]   And he just turned to me,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.480]   he knew how much pain I was in,
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.080]   even though I wasn't showing it.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.920]   And he said, "I want you to know
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.040]   that if it comes to a point
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.720]   where we need to take care of your dad,
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.560]   he needs to live with us, you don't even need to ask.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.920]   It is, I am 100% on board and will help."
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   And those are the things that matter, that home feeling.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.240]   And technically, that's a trait that's usually,
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.400]   that's sort of a, my husband caring so much about family
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.960]   and home and taking care of things that matter,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.040]   those are things that tend to be associated
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.840]   with that low to moderate adventurousness.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.800]   Somebody who really cares about simple things and family.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.040]   - I wonder if those things,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.400]   those three things are something you can work on.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   You know, conscientiousness, you can probably-
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.600]   - You can.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   - Proactively observe yourself and do it more regularly.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.960]   - Right.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   - Neuroticism might be the hardest one, probably.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.800]   - I think so.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.680]   Well, I mean, I was pretty neurotic in my early 20s.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.840]   - And when you wake up to it, maybe you,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.040]   if you're self-aware about it,
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.320]   maybe you'll be able to control it.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.160]   - Yeah, I think self-awareness is key.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.760]   I think that's why I love therapy so much.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.920]   I think life is about growth and our potential for growth
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.600]   and to make our own lives better,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.240]   to make the lives of others better,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.760]   to serve others, to heal.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.480]   All of us are this collective healing.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.240]   And I think we're all capable of growth.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.360]   - And the same with adventurousness.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.480]   I'm somebody that's pretty low on adventure,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.560]   but I keep throwing myself out there
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.160]   just for the extra adventure.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.360]   So you can grow in that way.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.480]   - Yes, and I am high in adventurousness
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.400]   and I was not really ready to settle down.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.960]   I was married earlier in my 20s,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.680]   but I would say that I am much more prepared
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.800]   to be in a committed long-term relationship now in my 40s
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.400]   than I was when I was younger.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.560]   - But in that same way for me,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.440]   I like to connect myself to high adventure people
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.160]   so that it brings me out.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.800]   It's like they're a horse and I get to ride them.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.960]   - Yeah, and that's the thing.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.840]   So high adventure people are attractive,
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.560]   they're interesting, exciting,
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.680]   but it can be a world of heartbreak
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.760]   because you're only under that spotlight for a few minutes
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.480]   and then they're onto the next shiny thing.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.960]   - Yeah, but heartbreak is part of love.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.080]   But that might be the drug thing
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.400]   that you were talking about.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.120]   Speaking of adventurousness, what about sex?
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.960]   - Oh, sex is important.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.400]   - What role does sex play in a successful relationship?
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   - Well, okay, so I'm saying it's important,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.800]   but I wanna qualify that.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.720]   Everybody has different levels of sex
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.360]   that are satisfying to them.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.600]   Sex can definitely bond you to your partner.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.000]   Orgasms are amazing.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.960]   They de-stress us, they're healthy.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.880]   I mean, you can have an orgasm
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.720]   and have a lower level of stress for 48 hours.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.360]   I think that's pretty incredible.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.560]   If you have, I mean,
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.800]   just that kind of physical contact with your partner,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.200]   even a 20-second hug with your partner
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.560]   has similar benefits to an orgasm.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.000]   You're gonna have a lower stress level,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.960]   you're gonna feel immediately close to your partner,
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.480]   you're gonna get a rush of oxytocin,
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.640]   which is gonna make you feel happier,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.480]   more grounded throughout the day.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.520]   So that's a 20-second hug.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.080]   You extrapolate that to sex and things are gonna be great.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.000]   - So it's just physiological.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.400]   But I wonder, there's probably metrics
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   about how often you have sex,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.040]   how that correlates to successful relationships and so on.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.840]   - Well, there are, but it really has more to do,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.240]   it's sort of like, remember I was talking
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.960]   about processing conflict and what matters is
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.200]   do people feel like it's been resolved?
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.800]   Do they feel like there's been a repair?
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.960]   Not necessarily how they go about doing it.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.600]   Same with sex.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.120]   Does each partner feel sexually satisfying?
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.880]   So that could be once a month for one couple,
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.920]   it could be five times a week for another couple,
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.400]   it could be never for other couples, truly.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.480]   I mean, so sex has a ton of benefits,
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.040]   but its absence isn't necessarily detrimental, I guess,
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.600]   would be the qualifier, depending on who you are.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.120]   - And I know couples that use sex
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.440]   as part of the conflict resolution process.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.120]   - It's hugely effective for that,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.360]   if it works for both parties.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.640]   All parties, not just both, all.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.120]   - That's true.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.680]   - What do you think about infidelity?
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.920]   What's the cause of infidelity?
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.600]   Why do men and women cheat?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.320]   - It's different for everybody,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.920]   but I mean, even earlier I was saying with adventurousness,
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.360]   like if monogamy is something you're doing.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.600]   I've seen in my own practice,
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.120]   I've seen the entire range of couples
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.040]   who are open about having sexual relationships
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.640]   with other people and fine with it.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.400]   Couples who wanna be fine with it,
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.680]   but find out they're not.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.720]   Couples who aren't just couples,
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   couples with multiple people,
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.160]   multiple romantic relationships.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.760]   I've had couples where affairs are tolerated
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.200]   and not talked about.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   They're not enjoyed, but they are not the type of betrayal
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   that will destroy the relationship.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.840]   A sort of a understanding and keep it out of my face.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.440]   And then also we won't talk about it.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.320]   - So an affair that happened without getting permission first
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.360]   and as long as you don't talk about it,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.560]   it's not going to do a damage to the relationship.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.280]   - Right, but we can't even talk about it like that.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.080]   So nobody's going to admit that the affair is happening.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.280]   There can't be any evidence of it.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.680]   It's sort of a just look the other way type of a situation.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.160]   But the partner who is not having the affair,
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.480]   they typically know,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.640]   they certainly know that their partner is capable of that.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.680]   They just kind of know,
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.480]   but they don't want it in their face.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.980]   It would become a problem if it was in their face.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.420]   As long as certain needs are met
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.560]   and everything else is okay at home,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.800]   it's just one of those things where don't ask, don't tell.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.200]   - Well, that's an interesting point
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.920]   'cause I've had a bunch of arguments with people.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.940]   I tend to hang out with, especially in the tech sector,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.440]   people who really value honesty and radical honesty.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.480]   And I keep arguing with people about this
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.720]   because to me, it's not that simple.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.080]   That's an example right there
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.520]   that honesty can be really destructive.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.240]   Honesty is also a really complicated thing
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.600]   to get to the bottom of 'cause what is really honest?
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.440]   - Yes.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.820]   - And how do I look in this dress?
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.560]   Like there's a million ways to answer that.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.400]   - It's perspective.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.240]   - It's perspective, yeah.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.060]   - A lot of it.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:53.900]   - It can be a cesspool in my mind.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.120]   If I'm in a bad place or my partner and I haven't,
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.840]   like if Tayem and I haven't been connected lately,
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.080]   my honesty of what I actually think about him
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.920]   would be horrifically damaging and completely unfounded also
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.160]   but, and it can change on a dime.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.760]   - And that's also not actual honesty
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.540]   to the big picture of how you feel about him.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.760]   I have interacted with a few folks
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.200]   who talk about their previous sexual partners, for example,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.280]   on the numbers of sexual partners they've had
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.880]   and they feel like that kind of honesty
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.040]   is actually empowering and enriching to the relationship
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.920]   because all the sexual experiences you've had in the past
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.640]   make you a better sexual partner,
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.040]   a better partner in the present.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.620]   And to me, from the culture I've come from,
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.240]   that's like anti-romantic.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.080]   - Yep, yep.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.440]   - You kind of throw the past kind of away.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.320]   You don't really talk about it.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.880]   It's kind of there in this amorphous shape
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.360]   but it's almost as if you've met together for the first time
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.960]   and this is a beautiful new thing,
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   like you're creatures that have woken up
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.480]   from a long slumber.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.240]   - Right, you're starting anew.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.080]   - You're starting anew.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.800]   - Right, and you went some mystery there.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.160]   - Right, I think the mystery,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.080]   and you have to figure that out about each other
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.520]   so I'm not exactly sure that honesty is always--
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.360]   - Stigma for everyone.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.800]   And then also is honesty harmful or helpful
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.720]   at certain points too?
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.560]   - Yeah.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.480]   So you're talking about sort of like
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.960]   disclosing prior sexual history.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.640]   I thought you were going to go to,
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.760]   so if you've had an affair,
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.000]   do you hold, do you keep that under your hat?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.520]   - Oh yeah, that's a really tough question.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.680]   - Or are you obligated to disclose it?
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.520]   - It's a really, that's a really nice--
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.160]   - It is a very tough question, very tough.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.640]   - Well, what do you think is the right answer?
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.160]   - I have my own personal beliefs.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.280]   I also then, like I have my therapeutic beliefs.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.480]   I think, frankly, and this is just me as a human being,
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.880]   not Shannon the psychologist,
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.240]   I believe that if you have fucked up,
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.120]   and again, I'm coming from a framework right now
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.960]   of monogamy, if you are committed to somebody you love
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.600]   and you have fucked up,
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.880]   you don't get to shed your guilt onto them.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.680]   You need to carry that burden.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.480]   It's not necessarily, I think it's simplistic
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.640]   and unsophisticated to be like,
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.900]   but then you're being dishonest.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.080]   I think it's actually selfish
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.680]   to unload it on somebody else
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.860]   and give them the trauma of imagining.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.220]   What we do know about infidelity
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:30.120]   is that it can create an actual post-traumatic stress-like
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.520]   experience for the betrayed partner
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.360]   where they are having intrusive thoughts about it.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.840]   Those are unwanted thoughts and it's uncontrolled.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.440]   It comes in at multiple times a day.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.600]   They'll have depressed mood.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.500]   They'll have nightmares about it.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.000]   Their entire sense of security, safety,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.600]   self-esteem gets shattered because of your actions.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:55.600]   I think it's kind of yet moralistic and naive to think,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.280]   well, they deserve to know the truth
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.800]   if you actually know the harm
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.500]   that that sort of betrayal does,
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:08.000]   especially if you truly mean to stop it, right?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.440]   So if it was a one and done,
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.760]   or if it happened and you've stopped it
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.000]   and you do not intend to do it again,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.880]   frankly, I think you live with that burden.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.320]   You live with that discomfort.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.720]   - Thank you for saying that 'cause I totally agree,
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.080]   but it's like logically,
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.960]   it doesn't quite make sense to give that advice,
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.520]   but psychologically it makes complete sense
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.880]   because you really are destroying another person's mind,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.960]   their faith and love in relationships,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.200]   their trust, everything.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.560]   And then you're imprisoning them to be stuck with you
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.160]   for months or years if you're trying to work through it,
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.720]   through that torture.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.240]   So you should be carrying that burden
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.720]   and working through it, I think.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.120]   Why do you say that that's your personal opinion
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.880]   versus your therapeutic?
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.280]   - Well, I think everybody has different values.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.160]   So I think that's a value-based decision
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.040]   because to me, the hierarchy is kindness
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.900]   and do no further harm,
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:11.520]   over, in that case, over truth, right?
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.080]   Whereas other people, my husband, for instance,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.080]   he is like truth above all else.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.040]   You don't get to decide what I know
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.040]   or you don't get to decide whether or not
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.220]   I can handle that knowledge.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.960]   So he would even see my determination
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.680]   of that I should carry the burden sort of arrogant.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.120]   Like, well, why don't you let your partner decide
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.720]   whether or not they, why do you get to choose?
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.560]   I don't know.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.840]   I think there's value to both arguments.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.800]   I absolutely see his point. - It's fascinating.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.840]   - I absolutely see his point.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.840]   And his, I think, is like a very humble sort of option.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.920]   Like, you don't get to choose what's better.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.400]   You just need to give them the information
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.240]   and they can choose.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.280]   But I think, I don't know, I think it's kinder to hold.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   I think it's going to cause your conscience
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.240]   more discomfort to hold it.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.720]   And I think there's sort of a cleansing we do
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.220]   when we share that information.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.760]   I think in real life, most people disclose it
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.200]   because they can't stand the secret anymore themselves.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.960]   That, to me, is a selfish act.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.680]   - I have unemployment applications and so on,
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.760]   and just with friends, would ask people,
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.640]   what do you care more about, truth or loyalty?
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.200]   Just to get to see how they think
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.920]   about those different questions.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.720]   And yeah, I was surprised how much variance
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.560]   there is on that.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.600]   - And also, conceptually, I bet,
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.240]   conceptually, I don't think we actually know where we stand
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.520]   until we're faced with a situation like that.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.240]   - Yeah, I think people, a lot of people,
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.360]   especially when they're younger, say,
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.400]   especially if they're kind of intellectual,
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.460]   they'll say truth above all else.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.300]   - Yeah.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.120]   - It's like, all right.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.040]   - You're exactly right.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.880]   - All right.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.960]   (laughing)
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.320]   - It's a platitude.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.360]   - Until you get to hear a truth that truly breaks you,
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.240]   truly hurts you, or causes suffering to you,
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.200]   and then you realize, or a truth you give to somebody else
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.840]   will cause them suffering.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.360]   And then you get to see that suffering destroy their life
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.000]   and maybe your relationship and so on.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.840]   And then you're like, oh.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.720]   - Yeah, like, should I sit my dad down right now
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.080]   and be like, dad, you have dementia again today.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.040]   I'm gonna tell you, dad, you're not making sense.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.960]   No, it's not going to be discussed.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.160]   We're gonna make him uncomfortable.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.720]   And I mean, yeah, I think truth can be
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.400]   a little bit of a platitude sometimes.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.880]   - Some of those complexities are all the things involved
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   in the challenges of what makes a relationship work, right?
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.440]   What do you think about open relationships in general?
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.360]   My worldview is such that I see the beauty
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.320]   and value in monogamous relationships just for me,
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.800]   but I'm also open to the possibility
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.520]   of what works for other people.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.800]   Have you done any kind of work
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.920]   with people in open relationships?
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.040]   - As clients or research?
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.880]   - As clients.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.160]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.920]   - Is there some interesting differences
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.640]   between open relationships and monogamous relationships?
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.040]   - You know, I think that may have been actually
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:07.080]   what was behind my question about the satisfaction
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.160]   with them being on the extremes.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.600]   My hypothesis essentially was, is it because they,
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.520]   if you are really all in,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.000]   you've worked out some of the kinks.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   I think I've seen couples who are trying it out,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.760]   like for the first time, it tends to get a little haywire.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.400]   There's some excitement in the beginning.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.240]   Everybody's really excited about it.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.840]   I think the philosophy makes sense to a lot of people.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.120]   The science of it makes sense to a lot of people.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.280]   But we have been raised in a society
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.720]   that is pretty monogamous.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.800]   So there isn't a lot of scaffolding around it.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   And there's a lot of inner conflict, I think,
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.360]   for people to go away from the values
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.560]   that they've been taught since they were kids.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.000]   And so jealousy arises a lot.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.920]   And also it's very difficult to be, I think,
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.400]   as truthful and direct as you need to be,
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.440]   which you're describing in these polyamorous situations
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.240]   where everybody is laid out on the table.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.200]   So I think that's something that may be practiced.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.480]   In my own work with clients,
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.240]   I've just noticed that the partners
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:20.080]   who are happier in these situations who I've worked with,
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.920]   they are more experienced at it.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.480]   They seem to have it down.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.560]   - You testified in the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.720]   based on your role as a clinical and forensic psychologist.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.760]   It was watched by, I don't know how many people,
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.480]   maybe tens, maybe hundreds of millions of people.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.800]   What was that experience like?
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.480]   - Thank God I didn't know that at the time.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.200]   - Were you scared?
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.080]   - Oh yeah.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.360]   - Given the size of the platform,
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.160]   how many people are watching?
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.480]   - Scared typically isn't the word when I testify.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.080]   I'm always excited and a little trepidatious
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.680]   before I testify because the stakes are so high
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.720]   for everybody's life in that room.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.600]   This was different.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.360]   I, anxiety isn't usually my brand.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.400]   (Dave laughs)
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.760]   And I just skipped anxiety that morning
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.960]   and went straight to terror.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.280]   And I was mad, I was mad at the legal team.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.520]   I was funny, like I was having all these strong emotions.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.440]   I couldn't find my bobby pins.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.000]   I almost started crying 'cause I couldn't find them.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.640]   I was pretty unhinged that morning
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.380]   and in a way that was really unfamiliar to me.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.840]   And it was right when I cried
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.860]   'cause I couldn't find my bobby pins
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.640]   that I realized I needed to get a grip
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.800]   and that I was a professional
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.320]   and that my hair didn't matter
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.760]   even though it ended up mattering.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.480]   People noticed that it was crazy.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.240]   But I got a grip and I went in and I just did my job.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.480]   - So the terror in the end helped you focus
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.840]   and do your job well.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.820]   - I think it does.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.080]   And it's a little scary though
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.940]   'cause I know what fear does cognitively.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:58.580]   And there is a sweet spot where you want some stress
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:02.320]   and then you can be really acutely focused and attuned.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.160]   But then if you go over this threshold,
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.360]   you get sort of that frontal lobe shutdown
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.640]   where you're not thinking clearly.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.940]   And everybody knows that experience
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.000]   from taking a really stressful test at some point,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.160]   like in high school.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.600]   And then they're going over the answers
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.140]   with the teacher in class later.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.860]   And they're like, how did I miss that question?
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.440]   I know that.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.760]   You're just in a different state.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.280]   That's when you have too much stress.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.920]   I think this day I actually was bordering on too much stress
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.880]   if not clearly in that threshold.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.040]   But once you're sitting there for a little bit
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   and you're asked the questions,
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.600]   you can kind of go into a routine
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.480]   of just wanting to talk about your work.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   - So what is the work, the job of a forensic psychologist
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.420]   in that context?
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.600]   - In the DEP HURD trial,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.560]   I was serving as an expert witness
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.020]   based on a psychological evaluation of one of the parties.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.480]   So forensic psychologists can serve the court
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.700]   or in legal matters in a number of ways.
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.680]   They can act as a confidential consultant
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.600]   for an attorney on a case,
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.840]   or they can even assist with jury selection.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.420]   They might testify without doing an evaluation
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.880]   if they're just coming to testify
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.840]   about sort of a subject matter.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.480]   And then they wouldn't be answering specific questions
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.460]   to either of the parties,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.640]   but just talking more hypothetically about a field area.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.820]   In this case, because I was ordered
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.140]   to conduct an evaluation,
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.940]   I evaluated one of the parties
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.220]   and then you provide a report to the court
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.100]   with your findings,
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:41.900]   and then you testify as to what your findings were.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:43.660]   - But from my perspective, just watching you,
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.100]   you seem to have held it together really well.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.420]   So what do you attribute that to?
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.100]   So you said like it calmed down
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.000]   after you were able to ask the questions.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.520]   So to me, if I were just to put myself in your place,
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.260]   it seems like the internet and the world
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.520]   would be very nitpicky about individual words.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:08.520]   You're speaking from a place of scientific rigor,
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.220]   and so you have to be very precise with your wording.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.060]   - Precise.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   - I would feel like so much pressure
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.400]   about each single word I choose.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.440]   Did you feel that pressure
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.800]   that you had to be extremely precise with the words?
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.100]   - Always.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.340]   The pressure is so high going in to testifying.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.680]   I think that's where I feel the most pressure is preparing,
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.220]   and literally the moment until I start having to answer.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.560]   And then I don't even have the luxury
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.180]   of thinking about myself
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:44.180]   because it is so important that that answer be clarified
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.360]   and understandable to the court,
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.020]   that that becomes my focus.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.500]   And that's the godsend,
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   is that I can stop thinking about how scary it all is
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.260]   because I need to pay attention to explaining something.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.300]   - So if it's okay, I would love to talk to you
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.100]   about the personality assessment test
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.700]   'cause I think it's actually super fascinating.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.340]   - The personality assessment inventory or the MMPI-2?
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.020]   You're probably referring to the MMPI-2,
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.700]   which is one I talked a lot about.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.140]   - MMPI-2, yeah.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.940]   So maybe can you explain the MMPI-2?
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.580]   Seems fascinating.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.420]   It has its output, the results,
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.100]   has some basic scales, has code types.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.700]   It's just reading through the different--
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.540]   - It's so complex.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.540]   It's the thing of beauty.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.580]   - Because the human mind is really complicated.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:34.580]   Even depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:37.980]   all of these things are really complicated.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.660]   There's like, many of them we don't understand well.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.460]   There seems to be a huge amount of variance,
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.020]   and yet you have to be able to stitch together
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.620]   a bunch of characteristics that give you intuition
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:53.860]   about the unique aspects of each person.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.380]   You want to be able to have tests
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:00.380]   that get you closer to identifying the peculiar flaws
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.640]   or beauties of a particular mind.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.740]   So this seems to do a good job.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:08.020]   Just reading through the different descriptions
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:08.860]   of the code types. - Can I borrow that
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.680]   until I testify? - No, I don't know.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.500]   - That was the best description.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.420]   - I don't know, I'm being poetic, I apologize.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.340]   - No, that was a beautiful description.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.380]   You have to be in part poetic about the human mind.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.660]   It's not math, it's psychology.
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.900]   Okay, so what is the MMPI-2?
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.540]   Like, what are we talking about here?
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.440]   Like, it's a questionnaire?
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.900]   - Yes, that's a great start.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:34.900]   So it is a questionnaire, yet 567 yes/no questions.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:39.300]   I'm gonna tell you what's most beautiful about this test.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.800]   So they used an empirical keying method to develop it.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.240]   What that means is that they didn't have a bunch
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.120]   of psychologists get together and say,
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.640]   let's ask them, let's make sure that we identify people
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.360]   who have somatic complaints or physical complaints
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   by asking them questions about like numbness in their hands,
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.320]   nothing like that.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.880]   What they did instead was they threw,
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.600]   you know, like take 1,000 questions at a group of people
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.440]   who they know had a certain mental illness
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.080]   and a group of people who didn't have that mental illness.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.480]   And then they looked for patterns in what the people
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.740]   with the mental illness endorsed as yes and no
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.080]   of those random questions.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.760]   So it would be, for instance,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.920]   there's a bronze light fixture right there.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.480]   One of the questions out of the 1,000 might be,
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.240]   I like light fixtures that are bronze, true or false.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.200]   And they looked for correlations in the way people
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.680]   would answer to these completely innocuous,
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.780]   just boring questions.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.480]   So there was no real way that a test taker
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.700]   could foresee the point of answering.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.520]   - And so because they can't foresee,
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.840]   it's very difficult to cheat to get to a conclusion
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.680]   that you're about to-- - Very difficult.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.640]   And not only that, but you can imagine using that approach,
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.300]   you can then look for patterns for almost any type
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:06.680]   of response style, for any type of personality trait,
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.260]   any type of mental illness, you just get a comparison group.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.940]   And then a group who's using that specific strategy
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.020]   or has that specific mental illness
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.740]   or has that personality trait,
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:21.020]   and you just look for patterns.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.780]   - And there's a scale output of different kinds.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.420]   - So I think-- - And there's code types.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.640]   - Yep, so you've got validity scales,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.380]   and those are just fascinating and often one
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.560]   of the most useful parts of this test in forensic context
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.440]   because they show you how a person is approaching the test,
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.160]   how they're answering questions about themselves.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.160]   So for instance, you can see if they are tired,
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.080]   you can see if they're kind of responding randomly,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.500]   you can see if they are in an unsophisticated manner
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.880]   trying to make themselves look perfect,
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.280]   but not very nuanced.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.500]   You can see if they may be deceiving themselves
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.600]   and truly believe that they are perfect,
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.540]   whereas others don't see it that way.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.160]   You can see if they're exaggerating,
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.400]   you can see if they're exaggerating
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.760]   because they're truly, it's a cry for help,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.140]   they are in extreme distress,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:18.280]   but they feel as though they need to really punctuate it
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.680]   to get people to notice.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.520]   Or you can see if they're exaggerating in a way
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:26.520]   that is driven for a specific outcome or gain.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.480]   It's just fascinating,
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.080]   and it's the most well-developed assessment we have
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.080]   for a person's approach
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.200]   to answering questions about themselves.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.520]   - So it gives you the context of--
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.680]   - How honest they're being.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.360]   - The state of the person as they're answering them.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   - Yeah, yeah, their honesty,
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.120]   how forthcoming they're being and how accurate they're being.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.580]   - And then the result of the classification
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.000]   based on the test are these code types.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.520]   - Right, well, so you have these clinical scales as well.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.160]   You have 10 clinical scales that look for different
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.720]   kind of primary clinical pathology issues.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.240]   This test doesn't tell you anything good about yourself.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.800]   At best, it just tells you that you're not responding
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.280]   in a way that is dishonest
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.960]   and that you are not hugely problematic,
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.280]   but it's not looking for strength.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.880]   So you have these 10 clinical scales
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.140]   that look for variations above the mean of the population
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.940]   in certain areas, anywhere from depressive symptoms,
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.000]   manic symptoms, physical complaints,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.200]   anxiety, nervousness, aggression, social engagement,
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.160]   whole scope of human experience.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.600]   And then there are much more nuanced scales from those,
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.520]   so little subscales.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.440]   And then the real power though of the MMPI-2 is in,
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.040]   as you said, these code types.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.440]   And these code types are additional patterns
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.800]   that have been detected
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.880]   that really can be more defining of a personality.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.680]   So you look for peaks.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.640]   There can be either two extreme peaks or three typically
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.920]   that make a code type.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.520]   And those peaks are higher scores
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.800]   on these personality traits.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.240]   And specific code types can give you a very nuanced picture
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.680]   of a person's general approach to life
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.560]   and their personal relationships, just their personality.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.640]   - So you can build on top of those code types
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.840]   an understanding, yeah,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.280]   how that person's going to deal
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.600]   with different kinds of situation.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.560]   And then there's, by the way, a lot of code types.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.400]   - There are a lot of code types.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.220]   - I was looking at them.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.060]   They're pretty interesting.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.760]   - It is truly fascinating. - I want to take this test.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.400]   I wanted to see which one I would--
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.320]   - I have given it to some people in my life.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.840]   It's just phenomenal.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.880]   - How hard is it on your side of the table to give the test?
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.080]   - Oh, it's easy.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:44.920]   You just proctor it.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.300]   You just make sure that somebody,
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.640]   there's no distraction, that they're well-rested,
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.600]   they are sitting there
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.920]   and they can just take it in front of you.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.280]   - So I guess the question is
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.940]   because the questions are well-designed
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.400]   and that it's hard to mess with them.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.240]   So you just give the--
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.560]   - It's very hard to beat it.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.800]   You just hand it to them.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.100]   - And it's yes and no.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.040]   - It's yes and no.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.160]   - Okay.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.700]   - But I should also add to this
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.060]   that this test, as much as I love it,
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.200]   and it is the most researched
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.080]   and widely used personality assessment in the world,
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.280]   it is not in and of itself definitive.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.140]   So you use it like you already have sort of a hypothesis
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.520]   and you use this for clarification.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.600]   And it has a ton of value
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.860]   for showing somebody's response or their approach,
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.040]   how forthcoming they're being.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:35.960]   But other than that,
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.040]   you really need to consider it as a piece of the puzzle.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.800]   You had said stitch together earlier
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.580]   and that was just one of those points you made
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.500]   that was perfect for describing this.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.840]   - There's probably no one perfect test, right,
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.000]   for personality?
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:50.840]   - No.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:56.080]   - I wonder, especially with advancements of AI,
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.800]   there could be more and more sophisticated ways
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.120]   of measuring, of collecting data about your behavior.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:04.960]   - Absolutely, there could be.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.720]   - And being able to measure some kind of more productive,
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.680]   especially not in a forensic context,
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.800]   but more in trying to figure out
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.280]   how to improve your lifestyle,
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.800]   improve your relationships, all that kind of stuff.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.800]   So the results of the test with Amber Heard,
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.940]   if you can speak to the public stuff,
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:31.900]   you said that the results of Ms. Heard's evaluation
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.480]   supported two diagnoses, borderline personality disorder
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.780]   and histrionic personality disorder.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.180]   Can you speak to each one of those?
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.260]   What are they?
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.620]   What are the basic characteristics
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.660]   of borderline personality disorder?
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.900]   - Sure, well, so right now, the DSM-5,
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.860]   which is sort of the Bible for mental disorders,
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.620]   it's what we go to our diagnostic manual,
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.360]   it classifies personality disorders according to clusters.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.340]   And cluster B is one that involves
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.780]   the emotionally erratic, interpersonally erratic
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.740]   emotional disorders.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.620]   And those include histrionic personality disorder,
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.980]   borderline personality disorder,
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.300]   narcissistic personality disorder,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.240]   and antisocial personality disorder.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.060]   Eventually, there's been some research on this
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.860]   and a lot of support for us eventually moving
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.980]   into a more spectrum type approach
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.900]   to considering personality disorders
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:34.840]   where you'd essentially be looking at dysfunction
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.180]   in different domains of somebody's functioning
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.740]   that has persisted over time.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.140]   And again, the really important part is
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:46.260]   it seems to be a stable trait, part of their personality,
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.220]   that it's in their interpersonal relationships,
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.600]   it's in how they handle their own life,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.240]   their own functioning, their mood,
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.140]   and it's not just situation-based,
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.580]   it seems to be all areas.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:02.360]   I don't love the title histrionic personality disorder.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:07.260]   I think its history is, it's pretty controversial
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.860]   and there's some misogyny in it.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.820]   But that all being said, as a servant to the court
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.040]   and somebody who is there to just provide the science
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.600]   as it exists today, my job is to relay,
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.240]   and in this specific case, I was ordered
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.280]   to provide my diagnostic impressions, a diagnosis,
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.880]   and I don't get to decide which diagnosis,
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.360]   whether I like a certain diagnosis or not.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.180]   Ultimately, if the criteria are met,
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.960]   that diagnosis is given.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.120]   So as we have it right now
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.680]   with the current personality disorder categories,
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.120]   histrionic personality disorder
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.600]   is probably the most controversial.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.280]   Some people believe that it is
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.120]   narcissistic personality disorder lite,
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.880]   so sort of a less obvious,
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.320]   a less malicious version
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.520]   of narcissistic personality disorder.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.840]   And I think that will probably get sussed out
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.200]   if we do move to a more spectrum-based approach
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.760]   'cause then you would be describing
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.160]   sort of a personality disorder
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.200]   and then you would add the traits to it.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.800]   So with issues in interpersonal functioning
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.080]   and et cetera, so you could be a little bit more specific
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.600]   rather than having to just put somebody in a category.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.840]   - So that's where things are moving, you're saying?
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.440]   - That's where things are moving.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.840]   - From a clusters-based view of NPD,
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.240]   antisocial personality disorder.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.360]   - To more of a spectrum with personality dysfunction,
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.360]   then you list the traits that are there.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.520]   And I think that'll be more accurate,
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.480]   especially there's so much overlap
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.360]   between these personality disorders right now,
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.240]   especially cluster B, it is not uncommon for people
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.040]   to have two or three personality disorders
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.760]   to meet criteria for two or three at the same time.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.680]   So speaking about borderline personality disorder
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.600]   and histrionic personality disorder,
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.520]   borderline personality disorder can best be thought of
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.920]   as a disorder of instability and impulsiveness,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.240]   emotional instability, instability in a person's
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.000]   self-identity, sense of self,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.640]   instability in a person's relationships,
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.720]   and then underlying all of this
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.440]   is an intense fear of abandonment.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.000]   Histrionic personality disorder is more of a disorder
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.160]   of emotionality, dramatics, and attention-seeking.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:32.240]   This histrionic disorder typically is known
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.560]   for the dramatics and people who are observing
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.280]   or interacting with somebody with this disorder
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.760]   may even feel themselves almost kind of
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.200]   wanting to turn away.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.360]   There's a sense of play acting as the person is speaking
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.520]   or engaging with you.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.800]   Something just feels a little bit disingenuous.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.520]   And a lot of attention-seeking,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.360]   similar to borderline personality disorder,
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.280]   you might see with histrionic personality disorder,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.760]   attempts to manipulate.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.680]   However, the motivation with histrionic personality disorder
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.000]   is that attention, whereas with borderline
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.160]   personality disorder, the underlying motivation
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.920]   for almost everything is to avoid abandonment.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.960]   So you'll see frantic attempts to avoid abandonment,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.720]   frantic attempts to keep people close,
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.040]   and those frantic attempts can be really harmful
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.520]   to the person and to others.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.880]   - To the person themselves.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.440]   So the fear of abandonment can result
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.960]   in the very thing you're afraid of.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.800]   - Right.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.360]   There has been some research also to suggest
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.200]   that borderline personality disorder
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.600]   has different types as well.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.320]   And I think this is really important
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.360]   because in my own work, I have encountered many people
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.960]   with borderline personality disorder in my own life.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.720]   And there are different types.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.880]   I'm thinking specifically of a girl I really love
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.200]   who I've worked with for years,
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.440]   who is so self-aware about this and endearing.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.440]   She owns her shit.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.200]   I can forgive almost anything
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.320]   if somebody just owns their shit.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.440]   She might lose her temper, she might lash out,
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.000]   she can be erratic, but she will come back and apologize,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.200]   own it, and accept full responsibility.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.560]   And not only that, but identify it and make changes.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.760]   She doesn't want to be harmful.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.920]   I adore that about her.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.760]   I think it's an admirable quality
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.640]   that more of us could have.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.120]   That's very different than, when you think about it,
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.200]   there are nine different symptoms
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.120]   and you only need five to meet criteria.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.600]   So depending on which symptoms you have,
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.400]   you might be far more calculated, conniving, manipulative,
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.760]   or you may just be more of the impulsive,
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.080]   kind of messy, emotionally erratic type.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.480]   And so there's some new research also coming out
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.200]   that's even suggested that among women,
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.560]   those that score higher in some of these
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.280]   more calculated traits of the disorder,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.840]   may actually be, it may be a certain presentation
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.480]   of female psychopathy.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.760]   - Are some of these personality disorders,
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.680]   again, probably impossible question to answer,
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:23.120]   but how much of it is nature, how much of it is nurture?
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.480]   Or how much of it is in the genetics
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.120]   and you just can't do much with?
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.160]   Maybe another question, a different way to ask that
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.600]   is how much can you help that?
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.600]   How much can you become better?
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.760]   - That is a tough question.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.760]   So there's been a ton of change
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.040]   in the way we've thought about the etiology
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.360]   of these personality disorders,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.920]   specific to borderline personality disorder.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.760]   I think in general, the view is that most people believe
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.400]   that it was associated with neglect or trauma in childhood.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.320]   While there is a correlation there,
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.880]   there's a correlation between that
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.760]   and many mental health issues,
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.160]   not just borderline personality disorder.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.000]   We also, there is evidence to support a genetic basis
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.720]   for this personality disorder.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.120]   And there are people who have borderline personality disorder
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.360]   that report no childhood trauma or difficulty.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.120]   And I have seen, sometimes things just happen.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.640]   So I think it's a mix.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.120]   I think we need to think of it as biopsychosocial,
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.320]   which is generally the answer to most things
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.240]   when you're talking about
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.720]   how a mental health issue comes to be.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.880]   I certainly think that in most cases,
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.960]   and here's just me speaking personally again,
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.480]   I think in my own work, in most cases,
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.800]   what I see is that somebody may have
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.800]   some sort of predisposition.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.880]   Then they go through certain life events
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.680]   and learn patterns of behaving that may serve them well
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.640]   as a child in a dysfunctional situation,
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.840]   but end up being very problematic later on.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.440]   Or they just have enough hardship that that gene,
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.320]   whatever it was, lying dormant,
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.840]   that little borderline personality disorder gene
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.880]   expresses itself.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.280]   And you'll see that with things like schizophrenia,
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.400]   depression, anxiety disorders.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.920]   There tend to be certain ages
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.840]   where you'll just see that expression happen.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.440]   - All right, for the record, it got cold in here,
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.960]   so we upgraded with a blanket.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.080]   (both laughing)
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:28.920]   You look cozy.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.360]   Just as a question for me, just observing the trial,
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.440]   it was interesting that, first of all,
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.360]   it was a really raw and honest exploration
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.200]   of an intimate relationship between two people.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.560]   It was interesting to watch.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.560]   I suppose I haven't watched that kind of thing.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.760]   It made me think about what makes for a good relationship.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.600]   All the many things we've already talked about
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.040]   in this conversation, it was useful for that.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.040]   But also there was raw recordings of two humans' interaction.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.080]   What did you think about that, that there's recordings?
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:08.920]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.560]   - The act of recording your partner?
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.080]   - Yeah, and not the ethics of that or so on,
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.840]   but the fact that you have this data.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.080]   It made me wonder, if I recorded myself, how would I sound?
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.640]   Like in my private-- - Well, you do record yourself.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.040]   - No, but here with microphones,
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.080]   but when you're in private,
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   you wonder, like I had a bit of a fight
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.280]   with a friend last week,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.040]   and I wondered which one of us was the asshole.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   I would love to hear the recording,
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.600]   'cause we were a little bit,
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.640]   I think we were a little bit rude to each other,
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.720]   and I wonder how it went wrong.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.960]   - I love that you asked yourself that question.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.000]   That's so useful.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.120]   - We made up the next day,
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.080]   and I think we both agreed to not ever talk about it.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.200]   (both laughing)
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.120]   - But I want the data. - Just bury it deep.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.640]   You know, I record my couple sessions,
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.360]   and one of the primary purposes of that
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.840]   is so that if they start to get nasty with each other
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.720]   in the session, I can stop it,
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.080]   and I can say, "What was that?"
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.000]   And most of the time, what you're describing is so useful
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.520]   because we don't see ourselves,
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.320]   we have no idea that we just came off as critical.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:23.120]   We think we're being completely reasonable and thoughtful.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.440]   Whenever somebody is sort of retelling an argument
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.080]   they got, and they said, "And then, you know,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.300]   "I was just caring and just asked.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.920]   "I mean, why, is there a reason you didn't?"
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.240]   You know, something like that.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.760]   If they can actually see themselves,
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.000]   they realize, no, their jaw was clenched,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.320]   their voice was raised, they actually called a name.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.720]   Sometimes they're shocked.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.480]   - So just a quick, just to linger on it,
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.600]   you labeled Amber Heard as a 3/6 code type,
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.400]   going back to our discussion,
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.520]   which can mean that, quote,
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.000]   "She's heavily concerned with image,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.780]   "prone to treating others with cruelty,
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.780]   "unable to admit responsibility for wrongdoing,
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:05.080]   "and prone to externalizing blame."
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:10.080]   And then I also went into the MMPI-2 list.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.600]   3/6 includes anxiety, tension, rigidity, fear of criticism,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.400]   suppressed hostility, merging impassive
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.360]   or episodic aggression, suspiciousness,
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.760]   egocentricity, what else, projection.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.800]   What can you say about that code
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.800]   that is not captured in the different personality disorders?
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.440]   What are we supposed to do that
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.440]   from a forensic psychology perspective?
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:38.480]   And what are we supposed to do that in general,
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.600]   forget the 3/6, in general, these kinds of code types
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.880]   in that context, in the context of a trial?
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.280]   - If I'm understanding you correctly,
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.600]   it's sort of what's the point of these code types?
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.100]   - Yeah, thank you for asking the question better.
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.120]   (both laughing)
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.280]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.840]   I just actually honestly really find MMPI-2 fascinating.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.280]   - I love that you do.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.880]   I love that you get it, because I just,
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   to me, it's almost unbelievable that humans created it,
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.080]   but I think that goes back to that empirical key method
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.880]   of creating something that enabled it
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.400]   to be as robust as it is,
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.280]   and something that is very difficult to beat,
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.540]   if not impossible.
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:22.160]   But the code types really,
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.960]   so it depends on, in any forensic case,
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.720]   what really matters is the legal, psycho-legal questions.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.280]   So what is the legal question?
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.800]   And then what is the psychologist's responsibility
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.040]   in assisting with whatever question they're being asked?
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.800]   And there's some questions we can't answer,
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.900]   some that we can.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.380]   You don't always need to provide a diagnosis
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.860]   when you're asked to provide a report.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.280]   It depends on the jurisdiction,
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.320]   it depends on the statute.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.000]   Some jurisdictions actually require a diagnosis.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.920]   In this case, I was asked to provide a diagnosis.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.720]   So when I'm considering a diagnosis,
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.720]   you're integrating multiple different sources
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.560]   of information.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.800]   You're integrating an examinee's self-report,
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.740]   you are adding collateral data.
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.480]   Usually, I wasn't able to obtain collateral interviews
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.380]   in this case, and that was a decision of the court.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.380]   They said no collateral interviews.
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.300]   But typically, that would be something that you would add.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.260]   You're looking at records, ideally,
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.540]   from birth up until the date
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:26.260]   that the alleged injury occurred.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.760]   And I'm speaking now specifically
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.460]   to a personal injury evaluation
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.280]   or something where somebody is claiming
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.020]   that they were harmed psychologically.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.980]   But you want as many records as possible
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:39.940]   to show how a person functioned before that event occurred
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.800]   and how they functioned after.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.300]   And you want it to show financial functioning,
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.900]   physical functioning, academic functioning.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.900]   Basically, where is there evidence
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.900]   that something in their life changed?
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.980]   Where is there evidence that harm occurred
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.580]   other than from what they're telling you?
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.780]   And in addition to all of those records
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.480]   that you're reviewing, in addition to their self-report,
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.940]   then you're also going to give some of these tests
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.300]   like the MMPI.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:12.300]   So the code types are really that strength of the MMPI-2.
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.160]   It gives you really nuanced information
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.840]   about a person's personality.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.480]   Now, again, you're not gonna use MMPI-2
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.700]   or any other test by itself to diagnose someone
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.680]   or decide that the person is telling the truth,
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.520]   not telling the truth.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.800]   It is just another piece of data.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.160]   And when it's working the way it's supposed to,
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.540]   it lines up really nicely
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.360]   with all of the other data you're getting,
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.800]   including what you've observed from the person
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.240]   during your interview with them,
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.800]   the information they're giving you,
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.880]   or inconsistencies with the information they're giving you,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.040]   the consistency or inconsistency
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.680]   of their self-report from the records,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.640]   what the records themselves say, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.720]   - So it's adding, it's helping you clarify
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.720]   and clarify and clarify the picture you have of the person.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.200]   - Yep, just dialing it down more and more.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.760]   You're just making sure that it is as accurate as possible.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.280]   - Okay, so given how huge this trial was,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.080]   given how eloquent you are,
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.600]   I know you don't think of it that way,
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.840]   but from a public perspective,
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.080]   you are like the star because of how well you did.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:15.920]   - That's insane.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.280]   I'm pretty sure Camille's the star.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.400]   - Camille is also incredible.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.340]   I've gotten a chance to interact with her.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:28.340]   She's somebody that really inspires me
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.160]   by how good she is at her job,
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.560]   how much she loves her job,
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.580]   and how much the fame, the money, whatever,
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.680]   has not affected the basic core integrity
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.040]   of who she is as a human being.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.920]   So she's also incredible.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:47.920]   Okay, what's the takeaway for you personally from the trial?
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.720]   How has it made you a better person?
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:55.280]   How has it changed or solidified who you are
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.480]   as a psychologist, as a forensic psychologist,
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.120]   clinical psychologist, and so on?
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.580]   - Wow.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:06.860]   A lot happened in my life around that trial,
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.180]   leading up to the trial, after the trial.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:13.580]   So let's tackle forensic psychologists first.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:14.820]   - Sure. - Okay.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.100]   So in terms of forensic psychology,
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.700]   I am grateful to that trial
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.200]   for really strengthening my abilities.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.620]   The stakes were so high that I took,
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:30.300]   I was retained about two years prior to the trial.
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:35.300]   So I really delved deep into the academic side
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.100]   of forensic psychology and making sure
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:42.100]   that I was adhering as closely as possible
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.580]   to standard practices, best practice recommendations
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.760]   for this specific type of an examination.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.700]   It was intellectually awesome and challenging.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.100]   I felt like my brain was on fire for a full year
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.440]   leading up to the trial,
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.620]   and that can be really, really fun.
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.100]   It was just challenging, but I am really proud
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.100]   of the work I did.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.180]   I think the stakes were really high.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.980]   It's serious work.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.940]   It's important that it's done well and accurately,
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.700]   and I felt really good about it.
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.620]   - So have some of those lessons carried through
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.140]   to your practice now, to both research
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.980]   and some of the things you're doing
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.440]   in terms of helping couples?
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:27.440]   - No, I mean, my practice hasn't changed that much.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:32.540]   This was more just something that was more,
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.340]   it demanded so much more of my time
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.540]   than my typical forensic work does.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.860]   And personal injury cases,
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:40.660]   or in cases where there is an allegation of trauma
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.300]   or psychological harm, tend to be super labor-intensive.
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.340]   This, given the magnitude and how long it had been going on
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.200]   in the back and forth, required a ton of work
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.480]   before the trial as well.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.620]   So it pulled me away from the practice.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:58.260]   I think it's been nice to go back a bit.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.580]   Okay, so now personally, I've learned some things.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.560]   I've learned that I need to slow down a little bit.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.380]   - So this took a lot from you.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:10.180]   - It took a lot, but it was really the culmination.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.100]   I feel like there are these hoops we jump through
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:15.940]   again and again, academic challenges
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:20.020]   that we continue to meet, and then there's a next one
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.500]   and a next one and a next one.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:25.060]   And in the beginning, when you're getting into college
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.540]   or applying to grad schools,
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.380]   you don't really realize this is going to be
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:31.820]   a never-ending thing, especially if I continue
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.780]   with research or forensic work.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.900]   I love it because it is so academic.
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.060]   You're writing these 75-page reports with citations,
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:42.740]   and you have to be accurate.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:46.240]   It feels like I'm doing giant board exams
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.120]   again and again and again.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.900]   It never ends, but that feeling,
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.340]   I think you and I were talking about
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.100]   how it's fun to doubt yourself
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.720]   because it pushes you to do better work.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.500]   But so if you keep having high stakes,
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.540]   you're going to work all the time,
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.380]   work yourself into the ground, constantly be thinking
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.140]   about, oh, this question, I'm not sure
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.860]   if I fully know the answer and all the research behind that,
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:13.700]   so I should go there.
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.540]   And again, super fun,
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:20.820]   but I don't just do forensic psychology all day.
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.460]   I also own a clinic.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.140]   I provide therapy.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:28.500]   I've been providing therapy for 15 years.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.740]   So what happens is you have clients
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.580]   who maybe you've stopped seeing,
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.460]   but when they have a crisis in their lives,
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.480]   they reach out to you again, even if it's seven years later.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.820]   So you've accumulated hundreds of clients
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.500]   who at any given time are going to reach out
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.160]   when they're in crisis, whether or not
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.660]   you're working on a federal case or in Virginia for this,
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:54.460]   and that is never going to be something easy to grapple with
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.260]   because I feel that I am letting somebody down.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.700]   I know I am because these are people I genuinely care about
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:03.180]   and they care about me and they trust me,
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.620]   and I wanna be able to be there for them.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.140]   I know that it's disappointing if I can't be,
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:12.300]   and it's also very difficult to separate out
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:16.460]   the professional therapy relationship from loving someone
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.380]   who you've seen through some of the most difficult parts
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.540]   of their lives.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:23.340]   And I can explain that to people all day long,
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.300]   but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna be easy
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.460]   for someone to accept when I can't talk to them
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.160]   and they just found out their husband
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.120]   was leading a double life or their sister just died,
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.820]   and I can't even get on a call
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:40.760]   because I'm getting maybe 15 messages like that a day
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.480]   and have to testify and have to run my practice.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.340]   So I think that was why I need to slow down.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.160]   This case, I was doing all of that,
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.260]   and then the academic load or the work involved
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.620]   was just tremendous.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.960]   And some stuff happened, like my dad,
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.900]   he started having his cognitive decline.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.820]   I got a medical diagnosis that is stress-induced.
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.660]   I really thought I was getting away with it.
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:13.540]   I really believed that people who talk a lot about self-care
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:15.620]   were kind of full of shit
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:17.900]   and just didn't know how to push themselves.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.420]   I still believe in pushing ourselves,
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:25.420]   but I think I kind of traversed into an area
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.980]   without realizing it where I was no longer pushing myself
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.580]   to challenge myself or see what I was capable of.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.820]   I was almost pushing myself like as a necessity
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.580]   'cause I didn't know what else to do anymore,
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:38.780]   just an obligation.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.260]   It wasn't even, yeah, I wasn't pushing myself
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:46.020]   to do, the Deb Hurd case reminded me of that feeling
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.300]   of pushing myself to do something
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.060]   I wasn't sure I was capable of
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:50.580]   and overcoming that challenge.
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.440]   That was rewarding.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.200]   But when you're piling that on with running a business
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.380]   and all these other things
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.120]   and trying to be perfect at all of them,
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.480]   that just starts to become like a feeling of necessity,
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.180]   and it's not healthy.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.820]   - That said, you somehow managed to hold it all together,
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.040]   to put forward a masterful performance.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.300]   And like you said, still take care of all these clients
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.520]   'cause you're the most important person in their lives
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.420]   for many of them.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:21.820]   Is there a secret to that?
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.180]   Was there any hacks?
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.980]   Is there a--
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   - I don't sleep a lot.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.940]   I don't get a, no, and honestly, it's not,
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:34.500]   it's a work in progress, right?
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.480]   I don't have an answer for,
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.740]   I wouldn't want my life to be any other way.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.720]   I wouldn't have had the opportunity to work on this case
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:46.960]   if I hadn't established my practice and had outreach.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.620]   So I can't figure out which piece you take it out
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.020]   without it all crumbling,
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:56.400]   but I would love to have a little more downtime.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.000]   - So it all kind of works together
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   and there's passion is the fuel that's behind all of it.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.600]   That's probably the reason
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.800]   you haven't lost your mind quite yet.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.500]   - Maybe, yeah, maybe.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.580]   Unless, I mean, it depends who you ask.
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:16.960]   - What about the stress of just being in the public eye?
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.000]   Has that been difficult for you?
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.040]   - That's a lovely question.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.840]   Thank you for asking it 'cause I'm,
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.720]   it is nice to talk to you about this
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.640]   'cause I feel like you probably understand it a little bit.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:32.320]   That was something I was absolutely unprepared for.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.680]   Like I said, I had no idea how many people were watching
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.760]   when I testified.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.780]   I had no idea and I got off the stand,
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.820]   I kind of staggered to the back room
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:46.740]   and truly thought about lying down on the floor
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.660]   'cause I was so exhausted.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.820]   And I'd been up studying all my stuff,
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.620]   terrified that I was gonna forget some statistic
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.260]   about the MMPI-2.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.340]   - It's gonna be so great.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.020]   It's great for me, it's gonna be great for people
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.020]   to hear this, that you're human.
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.540]   You're two flaws.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.740]   (Bridget laughing)
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:08.560]   That's extremely stressful for many, many hours.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.320]   I wondered how you could sit there for so many hours
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.920]   and stay so focused and listen so well.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.840]   It's so difficult.
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.680]   - Well, I mean, I could talk about that too.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.680]   The moment I came to, almost like came back to my body
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.880]   and realized where I was and just wanted it to stop
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.760]   and felt like I was burning alive.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.800]   I just was thinking, I don't wanna do this anymore.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.040]   I don't wanna do this anymore.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.000]   Is this gonna stop?
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.200]   And then another question came
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.640]   and I just had to get back to it.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.260]   But, so after I testified,
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.220]   the first time I went in that back room,
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.880]   I might've laid down on the ground.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.940]   It's kind of a blur.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.240]   I mean, I might have.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.660]   I do remember that Wayne Dennison,
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:46.040]   one of the senior managing partners at Brown Rudnick,
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.160]   who is a phenomenal guy and absolutely brilliant.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:53.540]   I will be indebted to him for life because I trusted him.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.460]   I trusted him and that made all the difference
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.140]   in probably how I testified.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.900]   But he came in the back and he was looking at his phone
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.220]   and he said, "You're on the cover of Time,"
[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.600]   something on Apple News.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.840]   And I thought, I mean, I really,
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.140]   I thought he was messing with me.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:12.900]   I thought it was his joke way of saying, "I did great."
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.580]   - You've worked with veterans.
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:19.660]   What is PTSD in that context?
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:22.620]   What's the landscape of psychological suffering
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:25.720]   that veteran soldiers go through?
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.720]   (sighs)
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:35.760]   - Well, if we're talking about combat exposure,
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:40.440]   you're seeing things you're not meant to see.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.560]   You're seeing the worst of humanity,
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.700]   people harming other people.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:48.700]   It's not natural for others to intend to harm us.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.940]   It's not natural for us to harm others.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:55.280]   And this dehumanization can occur
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.240]   that's so troubling and disturbing
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.680]   that people have a hard time living with it later,
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:04.080]   or they just feel this ongoing anger.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:08.000]   It depends.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.520]   It depends on the trauma they're exposed to.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:14.460]   It depends on whether their convoy was ambushed
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.800]   by weapons that were purchased from money
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.640]   that was given to this village from the US government.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.800]   It depends on whether they did something
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.400]   that they have a hard time reconciling outside of war
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.840]   now that they're back home in civilization.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:36.780]   Depends on whether they lost a lot of their comrades
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:39.080]   and feel that guilt of being a survivor.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:42.360]   And again, not everybody develops PTSD.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.000]   It really, it's a mental disorder.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.500]   It's serious.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.240]   We talk so much about trauma
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:50.120]   and PTSD gets thrown around lightly
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.040]   when actually it's very difficult
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.320]   to meet the full criteria for that diagnosis.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.080]   And many people experience severe trauma in their lives
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:03.520]   and only about 14% are likely to actually develop PTSD.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.120]   It's an exception, not the norm.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.520]   Traumatic stress is absolutely normal
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.080]   after something traumatic happens.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.480]   You'll likely have nightmares.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.640]   You'll likely have anxiety.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.560]   You'll feel depressed because you're a human being
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.480]   and something abnormal happened.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:23.480]   But PTSD is a longer standing condition
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.420]   that is significantly impairing in a person's life.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.160]   And I think we've lost that
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.320]   in some of the sort of narrative in society.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.120]   It just, everybody has PTSD.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.000]   But no, you can have traumatic stress.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.160]   You can be distressed.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.560]   You can be affected by trauma
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.000]   and not have that particular diagnosis.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.980]   PTSD significantly impairs people's lives.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:50.320]   - How do veterans, how do soldiers who suffer from PTSD
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.200]   or are close to that kind of diagnosis begin to heal?
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.560]   What's the path for healing?
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.720]   - Well, I will hand it to the military
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.800]   because I think in terms of working
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.480]   with their active duty service members,
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.700]   they really invest heavily in mental health.
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:09.320]   The US Department of Defense was one of the first
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.160]   to bring animal assisted therapy
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.080]   into any type of treatment in the early 1900s
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.260]   with bringing farming into certain hospitals
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.600]   and letting veterans help with the farms
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.860]   and brush the horses, which is so advanced
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.600]   because now we have all this research
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.560]   on animal assisted therapy and how beneficial it is.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.040]   And just looking in the eyes of a dog
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.640]   can increase your pain threshold
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.060]   and speed healing after a cardiac arrest,
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.660]   help people with dementia to ambulate more freely.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:43.160]   It's incredible stuff, simple.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.200]   And the military was ahead of the game on that.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.500]   And I don't think that's changed.
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:50.460]   I did my training at a military hospital in Hawaii,
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:51.960]   Tripler Army Medical Center.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.660]   It was phenomenal training.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.440]   And our psych department,
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.080]   there was so much interesting research going on.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.740]   And it was so integrated.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:06.400]   So you might not imagine that the military
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.540]   would be doing this, but we had an acupuncture department.
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:12.200]   We had a chiropractic department.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.040]   We had a yoga section.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.040]   We were doing yoga sessions there.
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:21.940]   I mean, anything that has evidence to support its efficacy
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:23.240]   was being utilized.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.840]   And I think that's pretty cool about our government.
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:27.880]   They have a lot of funding,
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.480]   so I'm glad they're using it on that.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.720]   The real challenge I think comes with the large scale need
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.160]   of the veteran population.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.800]   And they slipped through the cracks.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.140]   I know that the DOD had a campaign going
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:44.240]   where they were doing outreach to anybody who served,
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.680]   for instance, in the Vietnam War.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.400]   The problem is they were trying to get
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.280]   all of these people assessed for PTSD, and it was great.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.660]   Like they were getting phone calls, mail.
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.120]   It was sort of saying, "Hey, we know that you serve.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.720]   Come on in, or let's schedule you an exam
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.080]   with a psychologist and just see if you're owed benefits."
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.520]   The idea of it's great.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.920]   The problem is that they outsource
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.640]   to this third-party company.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.700]   They're paying really low rates
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.900]   for a one-hour meeting with a vet.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:17.020]   And you don't need to be specifically trained
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:18.580]   in assessing PTSD.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:23.040]   And so you're getting these variations and opinions
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.080]   that are coming through.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.020]   And I've had clients who, to me,
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.460]   who I've worked with for years
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.940]   who have clear combat-related PTSD,
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.980]   according to gold standard measures,
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.060]   according to my knowing them and observing their symptoms
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.320]   and how impaired they are.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.380]   And it is clearly associated with combat,
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:41.220]   the content of their intrusive thoughts,
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.620]   their nightmares, et cetera.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:46.780]   And they are having a one-hour meeting,
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:50.180]   sometimes by phone, with one of these psychologists
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.920]   who's been contracted by this third-party organization.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.540]   That's not even enough for me to get through
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:57.660]   the first few symptom questions
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:00.420]   on the CAHPS-5 assessment for PTSD.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:03.580]   But in that hour, the psychologist is saying,
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:06.060]   definitively, "No PTSD."
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.360]   And it's been a travesty for some people,
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.600]   especially for those who need an advocate the most.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.080]   It tends to happen to my veterans
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.520]   who are maybe a little bit less sophisticated
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.680]   in presenting or advocating for themselves,
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.360]   more humble, less...
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.400]   The guys who deserve it the most, right?
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:28.480]   They're just getting passed over, and it's a maze.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.600]   I'm not quite sure what the solution is, though, before.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.040]   I mean, I've worked for government agencies.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.480]   It's a massive population.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.500]   I love that the outreach is even happening
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.840]   and trying to get these guys in for assessment.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.680]   I think we can criticize any system.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.000]   I'm glad that system is even happening,
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.520]   but it still needs to be better.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.040]   - So I've got a chance to interact with a lot of soldiers
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.880]   that served in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.680]   and now a lot of soldiers from all different kinds
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.640]   of nations in Ukraine went to the front.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.960]   There's a bond between soldiers unlike any other.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.840]   I don't know if you can speak to why do you think that is.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.160]   On the opposite side of PTSD,
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.760]   there's a deep human connection.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.160]   There's a love for each other.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.000]   What is that?
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.260]   What is that about war and combat
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:21.560]   that creates that kind of bond?
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.960]   - We talked earlier about that vulnerability, right?
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.800]   So I believe that combat,
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.800]   I believe that most survival situations strip away all ego,
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.840]   and I mean, there are a couple of different layers to this,
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.680]   but I have not served in war,
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.400]   so I wanna be cautious here.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.120]   But from what I know just about psychology
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.400]   and also from my own experience
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.400]   of survival-type experiences,
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.840]   when you're with a group of people
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:57.840]   and all the ego's stripped away, nothing else matters.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.480]   The focus is on the here and now
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.720]   and a specific mission or your day-to-day.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.040]   You can get really close.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.480]   You're very, very vulnerable.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:12.280]   And also, in my experience,
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.040]   the guys I work with who have served,
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.120]   there aren't a lot of people
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.480]   who understand what they've been through,
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.600]   not only some of the unspeakable things
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.760]   they've been through in combat,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.520]   but some of the things that they feel
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.720]   are unspeakable about returning,
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.840]   especially if they are experiencing trauma.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.440]   A lot of them, some of the things
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.720]   that service members with PTSD
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.760]   are the most reluctant to disclose
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.720]   is the feeling like they may not know
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.600]   if they love their children anymore or their wife,
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.040]   that they don't even know if they can love anymore,
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.260]   that they feel emotionally numb,
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:49.840]   that they wanna kill someone,
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.480]   that they have a whole lot of racist beliefs and thoughts.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.960]   There are a lot of things that can be associated with PTSD
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.440]   that aren't as clear or expected,
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.720]   and these guys don't have many people who understand it
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.160]   or they don't think they would,
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.820]   but a lot of their fellow service members do.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:16.200]   - Man, so I'm going back to Ukraine,
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.840]   and boy, nothing makes,
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.640]   nothing makes, reveals the human condition
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.640]   in a more pure form than war,
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:36.640]   especially the kind of war you get
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.240]   in that part of the world,
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.480]   especially the war in Ukraine,
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.380]   which is a very 20th century kind of war.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.880]   - Brutal.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.640]   - Well, like I mentioned in a few different ways,
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.280]   you're exceptionally successful
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.360]   by, I think, the best definition of success.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.320]   You're doing what you love,
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.920]   and you're one of the best people in the world
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.760]   at doing it.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.600]   - Thank you.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.520]   - And so what advice would you give to young people
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.360]   that look up to you, that saw you in the trial,
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   which is your most public-facing thing,
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.880]   and are just looking,
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.560]   young people that are looking to find
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.080]   what they wanna do with their life, career-wise?
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.400]   - I love that question.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.240]   - What would you tell them?
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.440]   - I'm gonna tell them something my dad told me.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.340]   He said to me, "Shani, just pick anything.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:30.340]   "Pick anything.
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.200]   "If you like it at all, studying it, just pick it."
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.720]   He was like, "Look, don't worry about the job.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.460]   "You don't even know all the jobs that exist.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.520]   "Pick something you like.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.880]   "You will make it your own."
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.400]   And that is exactly what happened.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.000]   I like psychology.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]   I was reading some self-help books.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.320]   It's not like I had this calling where I,
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.600]   looking back, I can actually create that story
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.960]   'cause I think now it makes a lot of sense
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.380]   that I do what I do.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:03.720]   But I was lost and scared.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.560]   I started studying psychology.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.920]   I met a professor who was really inspiring,
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.360]   who wasn't even a psychology professor,
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.620]   but he was public policy.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.720]   I stayed in touch with that professor.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.900]   He is a dear friend still to this day.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.680]   That was 20 years ago.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:22.640]   We do research together in Mexico, integrative research,
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:26.520]   with public policy officials and environmental engineers,
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.760]   and I get to be the psychologist on the trip.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.000]   I never, ever dreamed that that sort of stuff could happen.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.400]   I didn't know about forensic psychology.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.320]   I also wanna warn anybody who's interested
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.840]   in forensic psychology that it's not like
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.000]   you're solving crimes all day and getting calls by the FBI.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.300]   You are going to be sitting alone in your home office
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.200]   with your husband bringing you bowls of cereal
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.880]   and reminding you to go to the bathroom
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.800]   'cause you haven't gotten up in like 24 hours
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.240]   from the computer,
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.660]   and you're gonna have papers all around you,
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:02.440]   and you're just gonna write 75 dense pages
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.560]   with citations of science.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.580]   It's brutal, it's academic.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.880]   But you're gonna love it. But it's fulfilling.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.080]   My friend Franny posted a meme of one of the girls
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.760]   from Glee or something crying and saying,
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.840]   I'm the happiest I've ever been.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.040]   And she said it reminds her of when I try to convince her
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.440]   to do forensic psych 'cause I think her mind
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.280]   is perfect for it.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.240]   You have to be strategic and thorough,
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.380]   but it's a slog.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.240]   But it's wonderful. It's wonderful.
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.640]   - The image of your husband bringing you cereal
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.440]   while you work on the 75 pages
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.680]   is maybe the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:40.480]   So we started on love.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:43.920]   Let me ask one last question about the same topic.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.600]   What's the role of love in this whole thing,
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.080]   in the human condition,
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.520]   in this whole experiment we've got going on on earth?
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.080]   - I think it's all there is, like that "Jewel" song.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.560]   (Bridget laughs)
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.400]   - How's that go?
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.040]   - God, I don't, don't sing it, don't sing it,
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:58.880]   don't get it in my head.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:44:59.720]   - Please don't sing it.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.400]   (Lex laughs)
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.520]   - There have been some profound moments in my life
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.520]   where I feel like I am closest to kind of the truth of life
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.300]   or what it's all about.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:15.560]   And usually there's this resonating sense of love and ease
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.680]   and love for myself, love for other people,
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.600]   sort of like it's all okay, we're all okay,
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.040]   we're gonna get through this.
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:28.440]   I liked what you said about the harm caused
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.440]   by the misinformation or negative things being said about you
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.760]   because you're right, it harms that bigger picture.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.760]   I think it holds us back, takes us back from that truth.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.920]   - That there's a love that connects all of us
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.880]   and that if you remember about that love,
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.520]   it's all going to be okay.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.520]   I really hope it's going to be okay.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:51.920]   - Me too.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:53.160]   - I believe it will be.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.160]   Thank you so much for talking today, Shannon.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.440]   You're an incredible person.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.280]   Thank you for everything you do.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.100]   - You are too.
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.520]   - And for everything you stand for
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.240]   and from everything from your text message
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.760]   to just who you are and for this amazing conversation.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.600]   - Thank you.
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.960]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.160]   with Shannon Curry.

[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.960]   And now let me leave you with some more words
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.460]   from Charles Bukowski.
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:21.680]   Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.960]   and you think, I'm not going to make it,
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.560]   but you laugh inside,
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.060]   remembering all the times you felt that way.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:31.440]   Thank you for listening.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.400]   I hope to see you next time.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:38.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:48.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
