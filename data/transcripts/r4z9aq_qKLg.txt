[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   - How should we think about the relationship
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.380]   between emotions and this thing that we call cognition?
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.000]   Because I think a lot of where we're going today
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.920]   is to distinguish between feelings, thoughts and behaviors.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.680]   And as neuroscientists, psychologists, et cetera,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.800]   we have to understand the difference
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.820]   between emotions and cognition
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.980]   and maybe where they overlap.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.920]   So if you could educate us a bit on that,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.960]   I think that will set the stage nicely
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.480]   for understanding happiness.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.920]   - Yeah, well, I'm glad you started there, actually,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.560]   because the very definition of happiness, I think,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.960]   as social scientists tend to think about it,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.040]   includes both of these parts, right?
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.380]   So I think social scientists tend to think about happiness
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.280]   as being happy in your life and being happy with your life.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.680]   So being happy in your life is sort of the emotion side,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.040]   right, a decent number of positive emotions,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.940]   maybe slightly less negative emotions.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240]   Like you existing in your life feels good.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.680]   That's kind of an emotional part, right?
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.720]   But then there's also kind of
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.080]   how you think your life is going.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.000]   Do you have purpose?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   Are you kind of happy with how things are going?
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.640]   It's how you think about your life,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.560]   which is sort of a cognitive thing.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.360]   And so even the earliest social scientists
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.760]   who started thinking about happiness,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.280]   at the time they call it subjective well-being,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.120]   'cause I think psychologists were like,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.200]   "Ooh, happiness sounds too wooey.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.040]   "We'll call it something else."
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.200]   But it means exactly the same thing.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000]   It means subjective well-being, right?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.720]   When they started thinking about subjective well-being,
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.060]   they divided it into this sort of affective emotional part,
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.120]   which is like how you feel in your life,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.520]   but also this cognitive part,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.340]   how you think your life is going.
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.380]   So that basic dichotomy has been there
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.340]   since the very beginning
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700]   of folks studying happiness scientifically.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.100]   - I'm already struck by this distinction
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.560]   between how things are going in your life
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.540]   versus with your life.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.100]   One requires a kind of first-person experiencing of life
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.620]   in your life.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.900]   Do you wake up feeling good?
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.340]   Are you feeling good with your,
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.760]   inside of your friendships and other relationships,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.340]   family, romantic relationships, school, work?
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.060]   The other involves a bit of a third-personing of self,
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.500]   of looking at one's CV,
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.940]   either actual CV or reflected CV
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.140]   through the lens of other people
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.420]   and kind of getting a sense like,
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.260]   am I doing well?
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.260]   Am I not doing well?
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.380]   I think this is a really important distinction
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.940]   because it seems like ultimately the goal, if I may,
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.180]   is to be happy in your life,
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.780]   regardless of the third-personing,
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.260]   provided that you're not doing damage
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.340]   to somebody else's happiness in life.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.740]   - Yeah, well, I think ideally it'd be nice to do both,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.860]   right, and I think there are moments
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.140]   when these things dissociate, right?
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.420]   So, you know, you interact with lots of interesting,
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.040]   rich people out here in California.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.020]   I think a lot of them have,
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.700]   kind of in their life feels pretty good, right?
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.980]   They have lots of hedonic pleasures,
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.900]   they're drinking nice wine,
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.140]   hanging out at the beach. - Oh, you'd be amazed.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.060]   You'd be amazed at how much suffering they report.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.900]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900]   - Right, how much suffering they report.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.740]   - So this is the question,
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.180]   is this sort of cognitive part the third-person part
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.820]   or is it the reporting part?
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.460]   And I think when the psychologists are thinking about it,
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.980]   they really think about it as the reporting part, right?
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.320]   And this gets tricky, right?
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.700]   Because, you know, I see folks having
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.340]   their nice glass of wine on the beach
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.620]   and I'm thinking, like,
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.440]   that's coming with lots of positive emotion.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.020]   Like, I bet if I tested them
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.560]   and could have a direct look at their sensory experience,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.220]   it'd probably be pretty positive.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.020]   It's only when they reflect on their life
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.340]   and they're asking, well, how's it going,
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.140]   that they say, oh, you know, I don't know,
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.660]   my stocks went down or like--
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.540]   - When I hear about lack of happiness,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.980]   let me think of some of the kind of bullet point ones
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.140]   that seem to come up repetitively.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.260]   They are indeed not related to lack of resources.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.700]   I don't hear that.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.460]   What I've heard,
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.740]   and this is also true for where I spend part of my time
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.100]   and where I grew up, which is in Silicon Valley,
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.120]   which is also not everyone,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.960]   but there are people there
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.500]   who have accrued tremendous amount of wealth.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.660]   The mean has shifted very high
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.120]   and hence the cost of living.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.980]   But it's often concerns about
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.100]   their kids or their mother is ill.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.520]   Their child is struggling in a particular way.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.540]   Very often that's what it is.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.900]   They're concerned about the lack of wellbeing
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.820]   in their kids related to mental health or physical health
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.940]   or other relatives, mental health, physical health,
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.040]   or they're upset about something politically.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.880]   But we won't go there.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.700]   - We won't go there.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.360]   Yeah, no, I think this is true, right?
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.460]   So much of our happiness is made up
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.540]   of the happiness of other people, right?
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.840]   Both kind of how they're doing
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.860]   and how we think they're doing cognitively,
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.340]   but literally just emotionally, right?
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.340]   If you've ever been around a family member or a spouse
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.660]   who was incredibly pissed off, really sad,
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.260]   it's incredibly hard not to catch those emotions yourself.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.740]   And we as psychologists know how these processes work, right?
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.340]   These processes are emotional contagion
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.780]   where you're literally catching the emotions
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.780]   of other people.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.180]   And so oftentimes the things that you most worry about
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.580]   to be happy yourself
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.520]   is focusing on the happiness of the people around you,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.540]   because that literally becomes your happiness
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.000]   at a very fundamental level.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.020]   - Now, I'm pausing just to think about this
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.140]   a little bit more as we grow up.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.900]   And I realize it varies by place and lots of circumstances,
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.700]   but as we grow up, we are taught to pay attention
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.420]   to how our life is going a bit from the outside,
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.140]   where you gain evaluations starting really young,
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.620]   little stars on our pictures, or good job,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.100]   or nowadays they say great effort in drawing,
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.580]   or this whole thing, the growth mindset language.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.680]   But I don't know that in the United States,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.680]   we are taught to think about being happy in our life, right?
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.060]   As kids, I think all kids,
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.060]   all mammals seem to gravitate towards joyful experiences
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.620]   for them, playing is almost always an innate,
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.980]   joyful experience.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.940]   But then as the evaluations start coming in,
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.140]   we get better and better at assessing our performance
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.140]   and where we are relative to the sort of standard goals
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.840]   of the third grade, the fifth grade, the 12th grade.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.240]   But at the same time,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.580]   I don't think anyone ever sat me down and said,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.220]   how are you going to evaluate if you're feeling good
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.620]   in your life?
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.340]   Like that you're savoring your soccer game,
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.180]   that you're savoring your time with friends.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.660]   That was never taught to me.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.340]   - Yeah, and I think there's a real danger
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.220]   of these kind of extrinsic rewards,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.900]   as you might call them, all the stuff outside,
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   the grades, the performance measures and so on,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.280]   literally stealing your intrinsic rewards.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.100]   There's this funny phenomenon in psychology
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.500]   where if you have something that's intrinsically rewarding,
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.660]   so let's say exercise, right?
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.820]   Like I want to go out and run a bunch, right?
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.540]   I love running, I get this intrinsic reward from running.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.540]   Now I get some sort of tool, whether it's my watch
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.800]   or something I'm scribbling down in a phone app,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.900]   and I have to log my running,
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.820]   now it becomes a sort of extrinsic reward.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.520]   It's not just like the feeling of running,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.460]   but it sort of takes on this extrinsic idea.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.740]   And then what happens is sometimes we end up going
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.240]   for that reward anyway.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.640]   The fiction writer David Sedaris has this wonderful article
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.620]   called "The Fitbit Life,"
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.220]   where he talks about how he wanted to get fit,
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.060]   it's intrinsic reward of exercising more,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.460]   and he got the Fitbit, and then it was all about the Fitbit,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.260]   and he would set the level higher and set the level higher,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.100]   and he himself was miserable and no longer enjoying running,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.740]   to the point that at some point he just would walk around
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.480]   shaking his arm just to get up to those final steps, right?
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.980]   That's a really terrible case
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.480]   where your extrinsic reward winds up taking over.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.060]   But so many of the cases you just talked about
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.900]   are ones in our real life where that comes up
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.820]   much more insidiously than with a Fitbit
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.660]   or something like that.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.500]   You talked about play in mammals,
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.700]   the easiest thing that little kid animals
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.960]   do all over the place.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.220]   Little kid humans don't do that as much anymore,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.300]   because even from really young ages,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.140]   they're in toddler university
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.460]   where they're kind of learning things
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.740]   to get into the next grade and get the perfect grade
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.180]   so they can get into institutions like ours, right?
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.260]   It all becomes about extrinsic rewards.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.040]   And so I think you're really right.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.420]   We're kind of extrinsic sizing all the rewards
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.620]   to the point that we're not getting to internal happiness.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.060]   It was hard already to pay attention to that stuff
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.800]   because I think we'll probably talk about this.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   It's hard to be mindful about your emotions.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.540]   You really have to pay attention to what's going on.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.100]   But I think it's gotten even harder
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.700]   because we have these metrics.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.260]   They're all over the place in our culture,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.860]   but they're just not the intrinsic thing.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.180]   There's some extrinsic marker
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.340]   that could make the intrinsic thing even less fun.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.500]   - For people that grow up or live in areas where,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.340]   well, let's just say that have less disposable wealth,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   is there must be data on sort of relationship
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.940]   to intrinsic versus extrinsic forces on happiness.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.300]   I mean, I can make up all sorts of stories in my head
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.900]   about how people starting out
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.180]   from very different circumstances
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.340]   would be more or less happy, but what do the data say?
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.980]   - Yeah, so these effects of kind of resources on happiness
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.780]   are really interesting and they're nuanced, right?
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.700]   So if you look at the lower end
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.020]   of the kind of income spectrum,
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.960]   you would obviously say that money affects happiness, right?
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.300]   If you can't put food on the table,
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.620]   if you can't put a roof over your head,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.060]   definitely getting a little bit morning
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.460]   is gonna affect your happiness in a positive way.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.860]   And the data sort of bear this out.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.060]   There's a very famous study
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.640]   by the Nobel Prize winning economist, Danny Kahneman, RIP.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.260]   Back in 2010, he did this cool study
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.560]   where he looked at the correlation
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.780]   between income and happiness
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.920]   as reported in how much stress you have,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.260]   how much positive emotion you experience and so on.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.620]   At the low end of the income scales,
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.980]   it just goes up and up and up, right?
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.180]   More money just almost linearly gives you more happiness.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.240]   But what Danny found
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.440]   and is the second part of this nuanced picture
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.100]   is that that slope kind of levels off
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.300]   and it levels off in 2010 dollars at around $75,000.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.140]   What does that mean?
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.700]   That means if you get more than $75,000,
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.460]   you're not gonna feel any less stress,
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.580]   you're not gonna experience any more positive emotion.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.700]   Even if I double or triple or quadruple your income,
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.380]   on those metrics, you're not gonna see any increase.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.100]   - Then those are pre-tax 2010.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.620]   - Yeah, they didn't get into like the real,
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.660]   'cause you're like, "Oh my God, well, I live in California."
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.180]   Like if you live in Iowa, maybe it's not so bad.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.100]   But like, and those numbers will change,
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.740]   but the upshot is there's probably some number
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.260]   in like 2025, 2024 numbers that might be like,
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.500]   you know, maybe $100,000, $120,000, whatever it is.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.620]   The point is that there's some number
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.020]   at which getting more is not gonna increase your happiness
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.420]   at the same slope.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.300]   Now there's been nuanced fights about this
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.820]   as there is a lot in kind of real research,
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.940]   but well, is that really true?
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.820]   Does the slope really ever go up?
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.980]   And now the picture seems to be,
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.500]   well, the slope might go up a teeny tiny,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.620]   like negligible bit, but it doesn't go up as much as say,
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.820]   getting an extra 10 minutes of exercise in
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.540]   or another 20 minutes of sleep
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.220]   or scribbling the things you're grateful for.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.500]   All those things will impact your happiness much more
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.620]   than like quintupling your income.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.560]   And so do your resources affect happiness?
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.300]   Yeah, if you ain't got any resources,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.540]   you definitely will feel happier if you can get them.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.740]   But if you have a lot,
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.740]   getting more really isn't gonna help.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.260]   - Sorry to interrupt, but lately I've been saying
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.260]   on the basis of those findings about this then 75K per year,
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.500]   probably now, like you said, 100 to 125K,
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.400]   or let's just say something like that,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.660]   would be the equivalent amount
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.200]   that money indeed cannot buy happiness,
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.400]   but it can buffer stress.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.340]   Do you think that's true?
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.980]   You're making me rethink that statement.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.660]   Maybe it doesn't buffer stress past a certain amount.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.300]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in the original Kahneman data,
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.500]   he found that it doesn't, right?
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.460]   I mean, how much stress you report on a daily basis
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.100]   was literally one of the measures
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.060]   they were using for happiness.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.580]   But I think you're right,
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.900]   the risk around it can buffer it, right?
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.940]   I think if you're at a certain set of means,
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.980]   you know that like, if a bad thing happens,
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.100]   you're going to be okay.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.960]   So it can allow you to make riskier decisions.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.880]   It can allow you to do things that you might not do
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.800]   if you're right at that boundary or losing some money,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.440]   it might pop you back down.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.680]   I think the problem is that one of the ways we evaluate
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.640]   our financial situation, but pretty much every situation,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.440]   I think this goes back to the neuroscience,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.720]   is that we don't do it objectively, we do it relative.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.280]   And when you think about your relative financial status,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.680]   there's lots of other folks around
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.360]   to whom you're comparing yourself.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.520]   I think one of the reasons that rich folks
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.680]   don't necessarily think they're less stressed
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.260]   when they have very high levels of wealth and so on
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.540]   is because they're looking around
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.840]   and everyone's doing much better than them.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.880]   Like, and this is just a fundamental feature
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.520]   of the way we evaluate stuff, right?
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.600]   Is that we don't evaluate in objective terms,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.720]   we evaluate relative to these reference points.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.360]   And honestly, as you get richer,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.080]   you're kind of going up the sort of logarithmic scale
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.160]   where the reference points are getting
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.920]   even further away from you.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.680]   And I think that that can have a huge hit
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.000]   on people's perception of their own happiness
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.940]   and their perception of their stress levels, right?
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.280]   Because they're working towards a goal
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.200]   that's probably not gonna make them that much happier,
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.720]   but they haven't kind of abandoned this intuition
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   that more money will make me happy.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.960]   On my podcast, "The Happiness Lab,"
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.840]   I had this guy, Clay Cockrell, who was really fun.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.400]   He's a wealth psychologist.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.240]   So he's a mental health professional
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.000]   that only works with the 0.0001%.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.360]   And already we should say, well, if wealth made you happy,
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.320]   he should be out of a job.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.480]   But no, he has lots of clients,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.060]   lots of, I guess, very well-paying clients.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.480]   He looked like he was doing well for himself.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.520]   But he talks about how those folks
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.940]   haven't abandoned this notion
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.480]   that more money will make them happy.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.880]   They set some standard, like oh, as soon as I become,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.640]   as soon as I get 50 million, I'll be happy,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.480]   or as soon as I become a billionaire.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.800]   But then they get to that point,
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.680]   they're not feeling any more positive emotion,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.760]   they're not feeling less stressed.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.120]   And rather than saying, well, hang on,
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.460]   maybe that hypothesis was wrong, more money doesn't work.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.720]   They say, ah, the hypothesis, it's all right,
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.400]   more money will make me happy.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.040]   I just get a, it wasn't 50 million,
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.320]   now it's 100 million or whatever it is.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   And so I think that that's a lot due to the fact
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.180]   that folks are comparing their wealth levels against others.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.720]   And our comparison system sucks
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   because we constantly compare ourselves against others.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.920]   But we never pick people that are doing worse than us.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.840]   We always pick people who are doing better than us.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.640]   - I know a fair number of very happy, wealthy people.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.840]   I know a fair number of very miserable, wealthy people.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.400]   I know a fair number of happy, non-wealthy people,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.040]   and a fair number of miserable inside,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.480]   where they report feeling miserable, unwealthy people.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.540]   - Well, it fits completely with what
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   a lot of the happiness research suggests, right?
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.660]   Which is that it's much less about our circumstances
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.980]   than we think when it comes to
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.900]   who's happy and who's not, right?
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.340]   We often think, if I could get more money,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.980]   or if I could get more accolades at work,
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.340]   or if I could get a new partner,
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.740]   if I could move somewhere, I'd be happier.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.080]   But exactly what you're saying.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.920]   If you look at people
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.380]   with all those different life circumstances,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.140]   both the good version and the bad version,
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.620]   you find some happy folks and some not so happy folks.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.280]   Now what researchers are starting to think
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.060]   is that it actually doesn't involve our circumstances
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.900]   as much as we think.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.020]   Again, I would bracket it,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.460]   unless those circumstances are really dire.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.300]   Circumstances don't matter as much as we think.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.940]   It tends to be the kind of stuff
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.980]   that's much more under our control than our circumstances.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.060]   It tends to be how we behave,
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.380]   what thought patterns we use,
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.660]   the emotions we seek out,
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.660]   the social connection we experience.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.140]   Those things matter much more.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.660]   And so I think your experience
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.860]   with the happy and not so happy rich folks,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.540]   and the happy and not so happy poor folks
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.380]   kind of bear out what we think.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.480]   Like, it's just not your circumstances
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.680]   that doesn't matter as much as you assume.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.460]   (upbeat music)
