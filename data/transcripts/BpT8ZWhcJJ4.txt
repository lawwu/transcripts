[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.520]   Welcome back, everyone. Welcome back. We're going to begin with a song. We're going to
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.120]   begin with a song on the Great Commission, one of the great mission hymns of history
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.640]   written by a pastor who had moved to plant churches in China and written for some of
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.140]   the many martyrs that had given their lives in the early 20th century. It's called Facing
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:01:01.140]   a Task and Finish. Let's stand up. Facing a task and finish that calls us to our
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:13.140]   feet. God be glad that we've finished. Reduce our soft beliefs. We who rejoice to know thee
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:27.140]   revealed before thy throne the solemn pledge we owe thee to go and make thee known.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:47.140]   When other Gods beside me hold their unhindered sway, when forces that defy me defy thee still
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:59.140]   today, with none to heed their crying, for I am love and light. A number of souls are
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:13.140]   dying and passing to the night. We go to all the world with kingdom hope and world. No
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:27.140]   other name has power to save but Jesus Christ the Lord. And we bear the torch that flaming
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:39.140]   fell from the hands of those who gave their lives proclaiming that Jesus died and rose.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:53.140]   Our tears the same conviction, the same promising joys. Fight by the same ambition to thee we
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:07.140]   yield our powers. We go to all the world with kingdom hope and world. No other name has
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:25.140]   power to save but Jesus Christ the Lord. O Father who sustained them, O Spirit who
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:37.140]   died, Savior whose love has trained them to toil with steel and iron. From cowardice defend
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:53.140]   us, from lethargy awake. For from thy merits send us to labor for thy sake. We go to all
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:05.140]   the world with kingdom hope and world. No other name has power to save but Jesus Christ
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.140]   the Lord.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:21.140]   Wonderful. We've been having the privilege of talking with many of you here involved
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.140]   in church worship every week and singing. One of the concerns is always to find songs
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.140]   that have energy but also equally with content. And a number of our writers last year started
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.140]   to look at the concept of the Apostle Paul and boasting in the cross. And Matt Boswell
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.140]   primarily along with Matt Papa and Brian Fowler created this song called All My Boast Is In
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.140]   Jesus which we hope is going to be helpful. If you don't know it, John are you going to
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.140]   sing the first verse? Is that right? John's going to sing the first verse and we'll take
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.140]   it from there. Here we go.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:10.140]   What wonder of wonders that love is this that Christ would die for me. His goodness, His
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:22.140]   merit, His righteousness. The sinner's only plea. Oh foolish friar, be crucified. The work
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:36.140]   is finished. All my hope is in Jesus. All my hope is His love. And I will glory forever
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.140]   in what the cross has done.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.140]   Wonderful. Can we go back to verse 1? Verse 1.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:55.140]   What wonder of wonders what love is this that Christ would die for me. His goodness, His
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:07.140]   merit, His righteousness. The sinner's only plea. Oh foolish friar, be crucified. The work
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:22.140]   is finished. All my boast is in Jesus. All my hope is His love. And I will glory forever
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.140]   in what the cross has done.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   Now fully forgiven my life is filled with grace that's undeserved. For mercy that flowed
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:53.140]   down that sacred hill that raises now return. Rise up my soul and bless the Lord who else
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:08.140]   is worthy. All my boast is in Jesus. All my hope is His love. And I will glory forever
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.140]   in what the cross has done.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:46.140]   Praise the one forever blessed. Him alone my heart adores. And I will boast in nothing
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   less than the love of Christ my Lord. Praise the one forever blessed. Him alone my heart
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:24.140]   adores. And I will boast in nothing less than the love of Christ my Lord.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:35.140]   I boast not in graciousness, strength, or might but in the grace of God. I glory in
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:46.140]   weakness to live is Christ in plenty or in want. That I may know that all may see His
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:59.140]   power within me. All my boast is in Jesus. All my hope is His love. And I will glory
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:12.140]   forever in what the cross has done. Now I stand in His freedom, ransomed clean in His
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:25.140]   sight. Oh and I cannot be ashamed for my boast is Jesus Christ. My boast is Jesus Christ.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.140]   My boast is Jesus Christ.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:45.140]   [applause]
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:10:04.140]   Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day, Christ on the road to Calvary. Tread by sinful men,
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:21.140]   torn and beaten then, nailed to a cross of wood. Oh to see the pain written on your face,
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:37.140]   bearing the awesome weight of sin. And every bitter thought, every evil deed, crowned in
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:56.140]   your bloodstained brow. This the power of the cross. Christ became sin for us, took
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:18.140]   the blame, and bore the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross. And now the daylight flees,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   now the ground beneath quakes as its maker bows his head. And curtain torn in two, dead
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:54.140]   ribs to life finish the victory cry. This the power of the cross. Christ became sin for
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:16.140]   us, took the blame, and bore the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross. And oh to see
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:30.140]   my name written in those four through years of suffering, I am free. And death is crushed
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:49.140]   to death, and life is mine to live, one through you selfless love. This the power of the cross.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:13:12.140]   Son of God, saved for us, what a love, what a cost we stand forgiven at the cross.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.140]   [applause]
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:45.140]   When I survey the wondrous cross, on which the Prince of Glory died,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:14:00.140]   my riches gained, I count the loss,
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:22.140]   and for content all my pride.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:30.140]   [applause]
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   [silence]
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:10.140]   I'm going to be preaching from Mark chapter 1. Mark chapter 1 and verse 29.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.140]   And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:21.140]   and Andrew with James and John. Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever,
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:27.140]   and immediately they spoke to Jesus about her. And he came to her and raised her up,
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.140]   taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:39.140]   When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to him all who were ill
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.140]   and those who were demon-possessed, and the whole city had gathered at the door.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:50.140]   And he healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:55.140]   And he was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:03.140]   In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.140]   and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.140]   Simon and his companions searched for him. They found him and said to him,
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.140]   "Everyone is looking for you." He said to them,
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.140]   "Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.140]   for that is what I came for." Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:55.140]   Father, I come before you in the name. His name. I know that you hear me.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:01.140]   I love you, and I praise you, and I magnify you.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.140]   For there is none like you in the heavens, or the earth, or under the earth.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.140]   You raise your hand, and no man can hold it down.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.140]   You lay your hand on the table, and no man can pry it up.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.140]   You and you alone are God.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:26.140]   And all the gods of this world are vanity and nothing.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:32.140]   Father, we are so small. You know.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.140]   We are so very small.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:43.140]   So many words. So little power.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.140]   Oh God, we need you.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.140]   The men gathered here need you.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.140]   We need the wisdom of your word.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:02.140]   But we also need the power, the life of your spirit.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:20.140]   What are we, Lord, that you would ask men like us to take your gospel to the ends of the earth?
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.140]   Help your people.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.140]   And let your power in them.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:38.140]   Be as high as the commission you have given them.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:47.140]   Help us, Lord. In Jesus name. Amen.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.140]   Before I look at the reason for which I was brought here,
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.140]   I want to say something.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.140]   Conferences like this are wonderful.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.140]   And they're helpful.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:09.140]   I've been both behind the pulpit in conferences like these.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:26.140]   I've been a missionary on the foreign field who came into conferences like these and just felt lost and small and unseen.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:32.140]   Let me give you something of a philosophical question.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:46.140]   Why would God plant the most beautiful rose that he ever created in a forest through which neither man nor angel would ever walk?
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.140]   How does God get glory from that rose?
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:56.140]   He gets glory from that rose because he sees it.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:09.140]   We live in a world today, a Christendom, that somehow thinks that you only have an importance before God if your church is so large.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.140]   Or you've authored a book.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:21.140]   Or, heaven forbid, you have a podcast.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.140]   Or you get to preach in places like this.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:31.140]   And that every man that's in this pulpit this week would tell you that is not true.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   There are some of you out there that have pastored for 40 years, 35 people.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.140]   And you have forgotten more about God than I will ever know.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.140]   And before the throne of God, you have a better name than I.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.140]   Do not judge with earthly judgment.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.140]   Judge with righteous judgment.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   And for you young men, I give you a warning.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   I would dare say again that every man that's been in this pulpit, they went through years and years of anonymity.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.140]   I know I did.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.140]   No one knew my name.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.140]   Ministry appeared to be a failure.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.140]   Three steps forward, two steps back.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.140]   Struggles.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.140]   Three steps forward, two steps back.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:29.140]   And I'm sure there are times on the mission field wanting to write the supporters and say, just stop.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:36.140]   I'm not worthy of the $350 a month that you're sending.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   And I fear for some of you young men.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   You get straight A's in Bible college.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.140]   And then straight A's in your master's degree.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   Department.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:59.140]   And then, I don't know, you take a big church or, again, heaven forbid, your podcast.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.140]   And your followers.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.140]   I fear for you.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.140]   I fear for your soul.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:11.140]   You are nothing except what you are before God in the righteousness of Christ.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:17.140]   And you are nothing except what you are before the throne in prayer.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:25.140]   And you are nothing except what you are to the smallest saint in the congregation.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.140]   I hear so many men today that talk about how they love the church.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.140]   They love the church.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:36.140]   And I look at them and I must say, I don't think you love the church.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.140]   I think you love your ministry in the church.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.140]   Do you want to know how much you love the church?
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:56.140]   You love the church as much as you love the smallest saint in that church who can least contribute to your vision.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.140]   As you have done it to the least of these, my brethren.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:08.140]   When I was in Peru and I was pastoring, there was people that had come from the mountains in order to escape the war.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.140]   And there was this one little lady.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.140]   She was about four foot ten, mountain woman.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   And every time I came down from the pulpit, she would be there to lecture me.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:29.140]   She told me I was wrong, that women can pastor because Rachel was a shepherdess.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:40.140]   And one day after she talked to me at length, one of the deacons came and said, "Pastor, why?
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:47.140]   Why do you stand there every Sunday and listen to her?"
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:55.140]   And I said, "Sometimes when Jesus comes to church, he dresses in very strange clothing."
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.140]   And that's true.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:05.140]   If there is one text that is scalded upon my mind and engraved in my heart,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:11.140]   as you've done it to the least of these, my brethren, you have done it unto me.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:16.140]   I just wanted to say that before the sermon.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.140]   Now, you saw maybe on the handout, it said, you know, why?
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   About missions, what makes missions so difficult. And then there's the Ephesians 6 passage.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:35.140]   "We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but powers and principalities, mites and dominions."
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.140]   What we need to understand is this.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:47.140]   The Great Commission, conversion itself is an absolute impossibility.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.140]   It's an absolute impossibility.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:25:01.140]   You must understand that there are no carnal means that you can use to pry open any gate, any door.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.140]   The heart of a man and the world itself is like Jericho.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.140]   It is tightly shut up. None come out and none go in.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:15.140]   If only we had to deal with the radical depravity of man's heart, we would be impotent.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:25.140]   But it goes far beyond that. Ephesians 6, 1st Timothy, chapter 4, 1 and 2.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:32.140]   We cannot deny that there is an evil one who rules over this world to some degree.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:39.140]   And you and I are impotent before all these things. We are impotent.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:47.140]   And that is why I always tell young men, the more you lean upon the arm of the flesh,
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:52.140]   the more, the less you will see the power of God.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:26:00.140]   And you can lean upon the arm of the flesh even though you are a great Bible scholar.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.140]   And you possess all wisdom and all knowledge.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:13.140]   But you can still lean upon the flesh by leaning upon your intellect and by leaning upon your eloquence.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:21.140]   You know, I think we've redefined powerful preaching in a disgusting manner.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.140]   We seem to have come to believe that powerful preaching is this.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:32.140]   A man stands before a conference of pastors and preaches with such an intellect,
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.140]   with such eloquence, with such style,
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:42.140]   that it causes all the pastors to put their head in their hands and lament the fact that they're not as gifted.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.140]   That is not powerful preaching.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:54.140]   Do you know what powerful preaching, how you can find it, discern it?
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:01.140]   Two ways. Usually both ways are not found in a single man as it was in Charles Spurgeon or Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:08.140]   But two things. Number one, souls are converted.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.140]   Souls are converted. They're actually converted under the preaching.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:33.140]   And number two. The smallest saint is fed. Nurtured. Grows. That's powerful preaching.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:42.140]   Now, neither the conversion of a soul or the edification of the church is a possibility that belongs to us.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.140]   If we are to be used in any one of these two endeavors,
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.140]   then you and I must cling to the wisdom of God and the power of God.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.140]   And we must do nothing separate from Him.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:03.140]   You know, sometimes I think, you know, when the disciples came to that little demon-possessed boy
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.140]   and they couldn't cast out the demon.
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.140]   And in one place it says it's because their lack of faith.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.140]   In another place it says, you know, this kind only comes out by prayer.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.140]   And I've often wondered, what's really going on there?
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.140]   Because Jesus gave them authority over the demonic.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.140]   And this is what I've come to believe.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:32.140]   They thought that whatever authority they had, that it resided in them as though it had permanent residence.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.140]   What you have to understand is John chapter 15.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.140]   He is the vine. We are the branches.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:46.140]   Authority. Power. Wisdom.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:52.140]   It's not something given to a man or that he attains by the time he's in his 60s.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.140]   It is something that flows from the throne of Christ.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.140]   This continual abiding in Christ.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:07.140]   And young man, you can have really good theology and still not be abiding in Christ.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:13.140]   You can become so talented, so knowledgeable, that you no longer, and yes, I'm going to use the word,
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:18.140]   you no longer feel your need of Him.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:27.140]   Every trial, every war, every reckoning, every breaking that goes on in your life
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:33.140]   has one purpose, to drive you into ongoing communion with Christ.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:40.140]   Not just through studying good books, but on your knees.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.140]   When we come to the book of Mark, it begins in chapter 1.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.140]   Look at verses, look at verse 15 or 14.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.140]   And after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee,
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:59.140]   preaching the gospel of God and saying, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.140]   Repent and believe the gospel, the beginning of the great commission."
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   The beginning of the great commission.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.140]   And if you look down in verse 38 of chapter 1,
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.140]   "He said to them, 'Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby,
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.140]   so that I may preach there also, for that is what I came for.'"
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.140]   I hear today about preaching, and preaching, and preaching,
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.140]   and teaching men to preach, and teaching men to preach.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:31.140]   Wonderful, but there are some things you cannot teach a man.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.140]   There are some things you cannot give a man.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.140]   Through any amount of seminary training,
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:47.140]   and that is for that man to feel his need of Christ.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:54.140]   And to walk fearfully in dependence upon him.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   I read you two texts, both of them have to do with the great commission.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.140]   They're prominent, they're strong.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   Couched in between that is also a great amount of ministerial activity.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.140]   But the pivotal point,
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   the truth of this passage is to see the prayer life of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.140]   That he, proclaiming that he had come to inaugurate the kingdom,
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.140]   that he had come to preach, and yet we look at him,
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.140]   prayer, prayer, prayer, prayer.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:37.140]   I have found that even in reading the scripture,
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.140]   and studying the scripture,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.140]   there can be flesh and pride.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.140]   Because at least when I get in a conversation,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   I can show everyone how much I know.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:53.140]   But in prayer, secret abiding prayer,
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   there is no glory before men.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.140]   There is only glory from God.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.140]   This great commission is not going to go anywhere
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.140]   with all your expounding, and all your preaching,
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.140]   and all your diagramming.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.140]   It's going nowhere without prayer.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.140]   And I would say with Charles Spurgeon,
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.140]   I would rather teach one man to pray,
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   than ten men to preach.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   I'd rather teach one man to pray,
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   than ten men to preach.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.140]   Now I want you to look at something here in the book of Mark, chapter 1.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.140]   We're going to go through this chapter 1 rather quickly,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140]   and we're going to focus on just one word.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.140]   Immediately.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   Mark, chapter 1, verse 12.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.140]   "Immediately the Spirit impelled him to go out into the wilderness."
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.140]   Verse 18.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.140]   "Immediately they left their nets and followed him."
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.140]   Verse 20.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.140]   "Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.140]   with the hired servants, and went away to follow him."
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.140]   Verse 21.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:06.140]   "They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.140]   he entered the synagogue and began to teach."
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.140]   Verse 28.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.140]   "Immediately the news about him spread everywhere
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.140]   into all the surrounding district of Galilee."
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   Verse 29.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.140]   "And immediately after they came out of the synagogue,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.140]   they came into the house of Simon and Andrew."
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   Verse 30.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   "Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever,
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   and immediately they spoke to Jesus about her."
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   I believe that if you read through the book of Mark correctly,
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   you will be out of breath.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:52.140]   Many New Testament scholars tell us that Mark is simply like taking snapshots of Jesus.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.140]   Immediately.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.140]   Immediately.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.140]   Immediately.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:02.140]   We can also see here an amazing amount of ministry.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   As you know, if you're preaching, if you're counseling,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:13.140]   if you're praying for people, something like virtue goes out from you.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:17.140]   Sometimes we make our way back home and our wives say to us,
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.140]   "How are we doing?"
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.140]   "Honey, I'm war to the bone.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   There's nothing left of me.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.140]   I can hardly breathe."
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   Spiritual ministry to advance the kingdom of heaven
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   and fighting against the kingdom of darkness will wear a man to the bone.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.140]   It's why most of us die young.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.140]   It will wear a man to the bone.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   And we can see this here with Jesus.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.140]   Now, I'd like to go through this whole passage, but I don't have time.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   But I want us to look at verse 32.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:00.140]   "When evening came, after the sun had set,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.140]   they began bringing to him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed."
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.140]   Now, I want you to look at something.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.140]   And Mark is doing this on purpose.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.140]   "When evening came, after the sun had set."
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   Sometimes I will read through the New Testament with my children
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   and I'll always ask them this question.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.140]   "Was that good grammar?"
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.140]   And the other day we were dealing with this.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.140]   And I asked my daughter, "What we just read, does that appear to you to be good grammar?"
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.140]   Or, "Would you get an A?"
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.140]   And she said, "No."
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.140]   And I said, "Why?"
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.140]   "The repetition, the repetition, the repetition."
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   But in the New Testament, borrowing from the Hebrew,
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.140]   repetition has a purpose, doesn't it?
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   It's to emphasize and emphasize again and again
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.140]   to show the force of what's going on.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.140]   And so we look here.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.140]   "When evening came, after the sun had set,
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:36:00.140]   after he had gone through all the things I briefly mentioned to you in chapter 1,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:04.140]   evening has come, the sun has set, it's late at night,
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.140]   and only then did they begin bringing to him
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:15.140]   and the whole city had gathered at the door."
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   Now, when we read this in the New Testament,
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:26.140]   many times we have this, and it comes from medieval art, actually.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   We probably have this picture of Jesus standing there calmly with his hands folded
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:38.140]   and people very orderly in a line, patiently waiting for their turn.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   Years ago, there was a conference in Santa Rosa in Piura in the north of Peru,
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   and a friend of mine who was a doctor was visiting me.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.140]   And so I took him up that mountain to the conference.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.140]   And there were about 1,500 people gathered.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.140]   Many of them had walked three days to get there.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.140]   And we had had conferences like that very often,
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.140]   and it was always beautiful, and the people were peaceful.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.140]   And it was just a wonderful time of preaching and fellowship.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.140]   But they found out that a doctor was present.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:23.140]   And even though he had almost nothing with which to treat them,
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.140]   they became almost violent.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:32.140]   These are people with great pains and ailments, no medicine, no doctor.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.140]   I ended up spending three days inside of an adobe hut,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:42.140]   translating person after person after person, day and night.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:49.140]   Sick babies with pneumonia, men with great pains, people with infections from cuts.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:56.140]   And the people who were normally gentle and kind became angry with us and angry with one another.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   They were violent, desperate people driven by their need.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.140]   It was absolute chaos.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.140]   And at the end of those three days, I thought,
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.140]   "I can't make it back down this mountain. I can't walk."
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.140]   That's what's going on here.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   Let me submit something to you.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:23.140]   First of all, most of us need to repent of our busyness.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.140]   Most of us need to repent of our busyness.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:37.140]   You desire so much to be seen before men that you're rarely seen before the throne of God.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:44.140]   But here we do see a picture of the perfect man who shows us that it's sometimes in ministry,
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:50.140]   it is busy and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.140]   And so we see Jesus doing all these things.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:03.140]   Night comes, it's dark now, maybe seven, eight, nine o'clock, and they begin bringing people to him.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:09.140]   I've known times when I couldn't get in bed before three in the morning.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.140]   This began at night. When did it end?
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:22.140]   As a matter of fact, I'm surprised that he was even able to maneuver his way out of the house to an isolated place to pray.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.140]   But he did. Look what it says.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:40.140]   In 32, when evening came after the sun had set, verse 35, in the early morning, while it was still dark.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   Maybe an hour, maybe an hour and a half.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:51.140]   And never forget, we have a true incarnation here.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   We have a true man, God in the flesh, absolutely.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:11.140]   But Philippians 2 makes it clear, a true man who was doing what he did in the power of the Holy Spirit and his physical body suffering from it.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:19.140]   Tired, war, worn out, painful, and yet he gets up.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   Now, I'm not saying this in order to advocate an absurdity that men of God should not sleep.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:32.140]   We need sleep.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:37.140]   But there is something that even triumphs over sleep.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.140]   And definitely triumphs over ministry.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   It is prayer.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.140]   Now, let's just stop.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.140]   Let's just stop.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.140]   I'm not preaching to hear myself think.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.140]   Ask yourself.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:04.140]   How much do I pray?
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   How much do you pray?
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.140]   Ask yourself that question.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:13.140]   Or as the old men used to, when they would see me coming.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   Young man, do we find you praying?
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.140]   Do we find you praying?
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.140]   How much do you pray?
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   Brother, I don't want to hurt you, but I do want to hurt you.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:39.140]   All these, I don't know what you would call them, all these trifling trinket kind of ministries.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.140]   They're not necessary.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.140]   Prayer is necessary.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.140]   You say, well, the word too.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.140]   You know that.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.140]   And I know that.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.140]   And you need to hear it.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   The word too, but more importantly, with men like you, you need to hear prayer too.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.140]   Prayer.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.140]   It's not by your mighty intellect.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.140]   Sometimes I think that a lot of historians with regard to Charles Spurgeon
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   are going to have a fight on their hands when they cross through the gates of glory.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:17.140]   Somehow they attribute Spurgeon's preaching to his mighty intellect.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.140]   Or to his memory.
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   Those things he had.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.140]   But he would fight you on that.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.140]   I don't care how great your intellect or how mighty your memory.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.140]   You can't do what he did.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   You can't look at Spurgeon's sermons.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:38.140]   You cannot read them and find a natural explanation
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:42.140]   for the fact that that much material was preached
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   and yet every paragraph seems to be gold.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   I have said to myself many times I could spend 10 years trying to fashion this paragraph
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.140]   and not be able to do it as he did it.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.140]   He was a man of prayer.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   He was a man of prayer like his Lord.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.140]   Bethany Jones said of Martin Lloyd Jones,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.140]   "You will never be able to understand my husband as an evangelist
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:14.140]   if you first do not understand him as a man of prayer."
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.140]   He prayed.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.140]   Now look at verse 35 again.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.140]   "In the early morning, while it was still dark,
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.140]   Jesus got up, left the house,
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:31.140]   and went away to a secluded place and was praying there."
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.140]   When I went in as a young man at about 21 or 22,
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.140]   and I went into the pastor's office.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:45.140]   I'll never forget, he was a big man, 6'6", silver hair, swept back.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.140]   He was looking at a bookshelf. He had his back to me.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:55.140]   And I said, "Pastor, God has called me to preach."
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.140]   He didn't even turn around.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:06.140]   He just said this, "Boy, can you be alone?"
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:11.140]   And at first I thought that what he meant was if I preached the truth of God's word,
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   people would not like me and they would leave me be.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:19.140]   That did happen.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   But that's not what he meant.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:30.140]   To kind of summarize it, it was while all the other young men
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.140]   are running around in bachelor packs,
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.140]   going on retreats,
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:40.140]   or having their great discussions about theology they don't understand
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.140]   in the hallways of the seminary.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:49.140]   Can you depart from all that and just be with God?
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.140]   Just be with God.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.140]   Just be alone with the Lord.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:01.140]   Can you do that?
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.140]   Let me ask you, can you do that?
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:08.140]   Do you do that?
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:12.140]   An old man, old preacher, let me ask you a question.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:17.140]   Do you do it now as much as you did it then?
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:23.140]   Or have you become less needful of him?
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:29.140]   I have found the very opposite of what I expected out of the Christian life.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:36.140]   I expected that all my trials, all the severity, all the pain,
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.140]   that it would come in my early years.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.140]   It did.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:46.140]   But it just kept increasing.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   Every trial in your life is designed to show you your weakness.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   Every one of them is to show you your weakness, your need of him.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:09.140]   You say, "Oh, Brother Paul, I know I need him."
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.140]   How much time do you spend alone in the word and prayer?
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.140]   And that will answer the question with regard to just how much you need him.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.140]   I need him more.
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.140]   I'm a weaker man now than when I began.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.140]   You know, with regard to sanctification, you know, if we did a graph,
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:34.140]   I always thought that when I started here that I would grow like this.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.140]   But in fact, I've grown like this.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.140]   But because of such struggles in sanctification,
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.140]   there's another aspect of sanctification that hardly anyone speaks of,
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.140]   and it has grown like this.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:56.140]   It's that part of sanctification that is the recognition of our need of him.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   There are no great men of God.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   There are only tiny, weak men of a great and merciful, omnipotent God.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:11.140]   Here in our passage, he says the kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.140]   Repent and believe the gospel.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:19.140]   Everybody pressing the tense here, spend the rest of your life repenting and believing.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.140]   And the idea is simply this.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:29.140]   One day as a lost man, I hear the gospel and I see God as I have never seen him before.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.140]   Which in that light, I see me as I have never seen me before.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.140]   Which leads to mourning.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.140]   But in that revelation, I also see Christ as I have never seen him before.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.140]   And my mourning has turned to joy.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   And then I go to bed and I wake up the next day and the process begins all over again.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:49.140]   As I study God's word, as I grow in the scriptures,
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:53.140]   I see more of him, more of me.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   Greater mourning, greater weakness, but more of Christ.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.140]   And at the end of my life, I'm a paradox.
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.140]   My mourning is greater than it had ever been.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:11.140]   And my joy is greater than it has ever been.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:17.140]   But the joy now is squarely founded upon the shoulders of Christ and has nothing to do with me.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.140]   I've decided what I'm going to put on my tombstone.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:26.140]   When you've gone through as much as me, it's pretty wise to think about that.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.140]   This is what's going to be written on my tombstone.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:36.140]   I've contributed nothing to my salvation, but my sin.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.140]   And nothing to my ministry, but my weakness.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:44.140]   Christ is everything.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.140]   Christ.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.140]   Christ.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:57.140]   And your strength, your strength is no replacement for his.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.140]   We look at him, we see him praying.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.140]   Look at what it says.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:08.140]   In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, went away.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.140]   Do you see that repetition again?
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.140]   Getting farther and farther from men, leaving men, leaving men.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.140]   Going to God, going to God.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.140]   Went to a secluded place.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.140]   Oh, the flesh hates going there.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:29.140]   Because the flesh can't take any witnesses with it.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:36.140]   As a matter of fact, I found out there's only one thing my flesh hates more than the study of Scripture.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.140]   It's prayer.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.140]   And was praying there.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.140]   Now I want you to look at what happened to him and what happens to us.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   In verse 36, Simon and his companions searched for him.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:54.140]   They found him and they said to him, Everyone's looking for you.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.140]   Everyone's looking for you.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.140]   Do you know what I read into that?
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.140]   Don't you care?
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.140]   Everyone, I mean.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.140]   Jesus.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.140]   There are people hurting.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.140]   There are sick people.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:19.140]   There are people in bondage to the enemy of Israel.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.140]   You have the power.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.140]   And you're here alone.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:30.140]   Don't you care?
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:38.140]   I cannot tell you over the last 42 years how many times I've heard that ringing in my ears.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:42.140]   From the devil himself.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.140]   Don't you care?
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   You should do more.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.140]   You should preach more.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.140]   You should do this.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   You should do that.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:59.140]   Yes, we should wear ourselves out in preaching and ministering and prayer.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:08.140]   But Jesus, if he shows me anything here, he shows me I will be no good to any man.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:22.140]   If I do not spend time before God.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:27.140]   Peter preached one sermon and 3,000 people were saved.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:33.140]   We preach 3,000 sermons and one are saved.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.140]   Now, that can be taken wrongly.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:39.140]   I don't want to press the point.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.140]   But it's not just intellect.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:52.140]   And it's not just correct doctrine.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:52:01.140]   The power of God will be manifest in your life and ministry or your life and ministry will matter little.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.140]   There's no way to move the needle.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   There's no way to advance the cause.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:18.140]   Through your gifts.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:24.140]   You have to lay aside, you have to identify and then lay aside Saul's armor.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:34.140]   And take up the smooth stones of the gospel if you're going to kill these Goliaths.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:39.140]   You have to walk in obedience to him if you're ever to see Jericho's walls fall.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:52.140]   There are countries and people groups in such bondage to the devil.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:59.140]   What power do you have?
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:04.140]   It's shunning the flesh.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:09.140]   Lashing yourself down to scripture and living a life of prayer.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.140]   Living a life of you say, well, I pray all the time.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.140]   Well, let me ask you a question.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.140]   Are you sure?
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:23.140]   All the old men that taught me said, boy.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:32.140]   You can only learn to practice the presence of God and to pray without ceasing if you are setting aside time.
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.140]   To pray.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.140]   It is there in the prayer closet that these things are cultivated.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:49.140]   I beg you, young men, get away from all of this, get away, become old school.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:57.140]   Get the mantle of a prophet, go away, seek God, throw stones at the gates of heaven, cry out until he hears you.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:02.140]   Oh, God, whatever I have, it is not enough for this task, this challenge.
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.140]   I need you.
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.140]   I need to know you.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:11.140]   I hear some people speak and they speak as doctors.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:16.140]   If I take my wife to a doctor, I can assure you he knows everything about her.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.140]   He knows more about my wife.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.140]   How her hair grows.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.140]   What gives nutrient to her skin.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.140]   How her heart functions.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:38.140]   He knows more about my wife than I do, but he doesn't know my wife.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:46.140]   When you speak, can they see?
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.140]   He speaks of his beloved.
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.140]   He knows him.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:56.140]   He walks with him.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.140]   You must cultivate relationships with men.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:03.140]   I have such friends back home.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:07.140]   They mean the world to me and without them.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:15.140]   But all the cultivation in the world with my friends, meaningless without cultivation of a relationship with God.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:20.140]   And I know using that kind of language scares some of you.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.140]   I want you to know.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.140]   I love the scriptures.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.140]   If you came up here and looked at my Bible, you wouldn't even be able to read it.
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.140]   It's so marked up.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.140]   But I have more than a book.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.140]   I have a person.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.140]   I have God, the father.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.140]   I have God, the son.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:45.140]   And I have God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.140]   Now, look what he says.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.140]   Everyone's looking for you.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.140]   Don't you care?
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:57.140]   He said to them, let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby so that I may preach there also.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.140]   For that is what I came for.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:05.140]   Here again, in Messiah, in that perfect man, we see the perfect balance.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.140]   He's not someone who hides in a prayer closet either.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:18.140]   But his relationship with the father was absolutely essential in the incarnation.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.140]   And what he did, he did as a man in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.140]   And there is so much in there that I can't unpack.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.140]   And neither can any other scholar.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.140]   But what we know is this.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:33.140]   He is our master and he is our example.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:41.140]   And instead of just trying to be a theologian, you might want to try being a disciple.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.140]   A follower.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:49.140]   An imitator of Jesus.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:53.140]   Especially in the matter of prayer.
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   Now, I want us to run over to the book of Luke for just a moment.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:10.140]   So that you see that what happened in the book of Mark is not a fluke.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.140]   Also, we need to understand something when we come to Luke.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:19.140]   He is going to greatly emphasize the prayer life of Jesus.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.140]   What else does Luke emphasize?
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:27.140]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:33.140]   Brothers, I will acknowledge that in the West.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:37.140]   There is aberrant teaching with regard to the Holy Spirit.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:45.140]   Much of it, such teaching as we could rightly call it heresy and even blasphemy.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   But I am not going to allow the heresy of false prophets to rob me of my inheritance.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.140]   I've read the fathers.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.140]   I've read the patristics.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.140]   I've read the reformers.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.140]   And I most certainly have read the Puritans.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:11.140]   And I can tell you their language was not limited with regard to the Holy Spirit or his power.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.140]   I'm afraid for some of you.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:19.140]   You're so afraid of heresy in this matter.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:24.140]   That I think you would be afraid to pray to God.
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   Fill me with the Holy Spirit.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   And you're going down a road.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:41.140]   It's going to find you in a library somewhere touching no one's life.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.140]   Never fall into heresy.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:48.140]   Recognize that there's much being taught out there about the Holy Spirit.
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:53.140]   That is, yes, blasphemous.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.140]   Here's false doctrine.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.140]   Here's the truth.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:59:01.140]   Make sure that some of you do not run past the truth into error on the other side.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:05.140]   Because without the Holy Spirit, there is nothing.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.140]   Nothing.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:14.140]   And his name is not to be dreaded.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:18.140]   How dare we?
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:27.140]   The father and the son dwell in us through the spirit of God.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:42.140]   It didn't take me long in my Christian pilgrimage to know I didn't have much of an intellect.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:52.140]   But through my dear friend George Mueller, I learned that I just might be weak enough to pray.
[00:59:52.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   And that the spirit of God can take a man with not much talent, not much knowledge, not much ability.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:05.140]   And change him into something else.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.140]   And I will never let go of this.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.140]   Whether I'm never asked back here or not.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.140]   The Holy Spirit is a person of the Trinity.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:26.140]   Who should be, who should be the answer that comes out of our mouth every time someone says.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.140]   How have you advanced?
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.140]   How did you preach that way?
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:40.140]   From where did your boldness come?
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.140]   Luke chapter 5.
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.140]   Verse 15.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:48.140]   But the news about him was spreading even farther.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:52.140]   And large crowds were gathering to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   But Jesus himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:02.140]   Do you know in many conferences of the old men.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.140]   If they had a conference like this, they'd have a prayer tent set up.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   And some men wouldn't leave it.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.140]   Would stay there 24 hours a day praying.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.140]   That revival might break out.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.140]   That men might be changed.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.140]   That souls might be saved.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.140]   Here we see news about Jesus is going everywhere.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.140]   It's spreading farther and farther.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.140]   Crowds are chasing him down.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:28.140]   But Jesus would often slip away to the wilderness and pray.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.140]   Look at chapter 6.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.140]   Verse 12.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.140]   It was at this time that he went off to the mountain to pray.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.140]   And he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:43.140]   He has to make an important decision with regard to those who he would call his apostles.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.140]   And he spends the entire night in prayer to God.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.140]   Did anyone have wisdom like Christ had wisdom?
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:55.140]   Did anyone grasp the will of God like Messiah?
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   We know from Isaiah that God spoke to him in the mornings.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   No one ever had communion as he had communion.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.140]   And yet he goes off to pray.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.140]   Then go to chapter 9.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   And verse 18.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:17.140]   And it happened while he was praying alone.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.140]   The disciples were with him and he questioned them saying.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.140]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.140]   Another another prayer reference.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.140]   Verse 28 of the same chapter.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:42.140]   Some eight days after these sayings, he took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.140]   You may gather a group of young men to teach them to preach.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.140]   And if you do that, you do well.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.140]   Do it more.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.140]   Do it more.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:58.140]   But how often have you called their names and gathered them to pray?
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.140]   How often?
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.140]   Chapter 11.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:06.140]   Verse 1.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:16.140]   It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:21.140]   Just as John also taught his disciples.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.140]   Do you know what's so amazing about this?
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:28.140]   It's what we do not see.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:33.140]   Jesus did some amazing things, did he not?
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   Isn't it amazing?
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:43.140]   That we never hear the disciples come to Jesus and say, teach us to teach like you teach.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.140]   Teach us to cast out demons as you cast out demons.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:52.140]   Teach us to walk on water as you walk on water.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.140]   Teach us to raise the dead.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.140]   Teach us to heal the sick.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:07.140]   If I'm going to ask a man to teach me something, it's going to be the thing that I find most spectacular in the life of that man.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   I honestly believe that the most spectacular thing about Jesus was his communion with God in prayer.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:29.140]   Senator Draven Hill one time shared with us about a man of prayer.
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:36.140]   That he came upon him while he was praying, came through the door and the man was praying.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:42.140]   And he stopped dead in his tracks and he backed out of the room.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:46.140]   And one young man asked him, why did you back out of the room?
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:52.140]   And he said, because you don't turn your back on royalty.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   I never identified that man or Leonard Ravenhill never identified that man, but I think I identified him.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.140]   And I remember the first time I met him.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:08.140]   Old man.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:16.140]   And he heard that I had just pulled up in the parking lot and I had found out that he had a deep love for me, even though he never saw me.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:23.140]   And he rushed out of the church into the parking lot as I'm getting out of my car.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:41.140]   And he looked at me. And I just broke down weeping. The love. The life of Christ in him.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:51.140]   Brothers. The Christian life is supernatural or it's not.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:58.140]   And I have been I've had the privilege at times of walking with old men.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   Now I'm one of them, but I've not attained to what they attained.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.140]   Such a fragrance of Christ.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:13.140]   Such a beauty, such a brokenness.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:19.140]   And such a power.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:34.140]   I recognize that they had been with Jesus.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:38.140]   The most spectacular thing about our Lord.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.140]   Was his communion with the father.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.140]   Oh, what what it would have been like.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:50.140]   Such reverence and yet such familiarity.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:55.140]   Beware, pastor. Beware.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.140]   You walk up into the pulpit.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:03.140]   You greet the church wonderful with joy, excitement.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.140]   Brothers, it's great to have you here today.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.140]   It's so wonderful to see all of you.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.140]   I hope we have a wonderful time in the Lord.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:16.140]   Now, let's pray our dear father, who when you do that, I think you do not pray much.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.140]   I'm scared of you.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.140]   I don't care what comes out of your mouth after that.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.140]   Do you realize what you do you realize?
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:30.140]   You know, we talk about the irreverence of others. Physician, heal thyself.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   No, this is real.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:40.140]   It's why sometimes many times when I pray, especially when I'm praying for someone who's who's sick or burdened.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:45.140]   I say, oh, Lord, I know you hear me.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:50.140]   This is not a small thing.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:55.140]   I spent a big part of the afternoon on Monday with Dr. MacArthur.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.140]   When I when I before I walked in, I settled my heart.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:03.140]   Why?
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:08.140]   My honor of him.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.140]   He's earned that in my heart.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.140]   Watch your speech, Paul.
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.140]   You're often careless.
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.140]   He's one of God's.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.140]   Do you see?
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.140]   It's the same way with prayer.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.140]   Settle your heart.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:37.140]   The wisdom of Ecclesiastes should be familiar to you.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.140]   Be careful.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:44.140]   Oh, in the presence of God and in prayer, there can be such joy.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:49.140]   There can be such praise and such worship, but never forget.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.140]   He is your father.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:56.140]   But your father is the king of heaven.
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.140]   He's the king of heaven.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:03.140]   Now, I want you to go quickly because I want you to see something in verse two, he says.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:12.140]   And he said to them, when you pray, say, OK, now, brothers, look at me, look at me.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.140]   Let's not be teenagers here.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:19.140]   A teenager will ask the parent, Dad, how should I do this?
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.140]   The dad says very clearly do it this way.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:27.140]   And then the teenager does not.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:34.140]   So the only time in Scripture someone comes to God in the flesh and says, teach us to pray.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.140]   And he says, pray then in this way.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.140]   And very few people do.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   It's not that we are to repeat the words as though it was a pagan ritual.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.140]   But our master.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   The great one who communed with God is now going to tell us how to pray and to get a full look at it,
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:03.140]   I want you to run over to Matthew quickly.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:08.140]   Chapter six.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   Lord, how do we pray?
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:14.140]   Verse nine, pray then in this way.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:18.140]   Is that not clear?
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:28.140]   Now, again, I want to iterate that it does not mean repeat these words, but he's giving us a structure for prayer.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.140]   Pray then in this way, our father who is in heaven.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:37.140]   Have you ever heard a preacher say, you know, Abba means daddy?
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:42.140]   No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:51.140]   No. I've seen some languages in which you can do that, particularly in Africa,
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:59.140]   where a term of endearment with regard to a father does not lose the reverence of the father.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:04.140]   We say daddy. No.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:13.140]   There's no way in this terminology to to exaggerate the endearment, to exaggerate the love of the father.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.140]   There's just no way to do it.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:21.140]   But at the same time, he is your father, but he is your father in heaven.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:25.140]   And you must remember that and you say, well, how do I do this?
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:32.140]   You hold both things in attention and that tension seems to work itself out as you study scripture.
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   And as you pray, as you understand more and more about the attributes and virtue and wonder and beauty of God,
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   as you understand more about the power and place of our redemption, it just starts working itself out.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.140]   But be very careful.
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   He is your father, but your father is in heaven and he's the king of glory.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:12:07.140]   There have been such times of joy in prayer that you would think we've lost our mind.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:13.140]   And yet there can be a settled reverence in that.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:21.140]   But he's our father who is in heaven and then one petition, three petitions, three in one.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:30.140]   Hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.140]   What's going on here?
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.140]   Well, first of all, let's just look at these separately.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.140]   Hallowed be your name.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.140]   Holy be your name.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:56.140]   So in all praying, the ambition, the singular ambition of every prayer we ever make is that his name be hallowed.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.140]   And what does that mean?
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.140]   That it be separated.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:04.140]   Have you ever heard someone say, keep God number one?
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:12.140]   That's a foolish statement because you're assuming God is number one in a long list of things.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:19.140]   You should never say something like that because God is not in the same category with everything else.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.140]   He's in a category all to himself.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   He's not at the top of a list.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.140]   He's not on the list.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:42.140]   And when we pray, hallowed be thy name, what we are praying is, Lord, I pray that your name would be separated from all other names and raised above them and esteemed above all other names.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.140]   And I pray this for my heart.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.140]   I pray this for my wife.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.140]   I pray this for my children.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.140]   I pray this for the church.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:55.140]   And I pray this for the nations.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:05.140]   That in the heart of every man, woman, and child, that in the beating heart, there would be one singular ambition.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   That they would see you and esteem you above all other things with no competing loyalties.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:18.140]   And that's what purity of heart means in the Beatitudes.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.140]   Blessed are the pure of heart.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:24.140]   Blessed are those who have no competing loyalties in their heart.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.140]   Do you see?
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.140]   That's a prayer for me.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   That's a prayer for my loved one.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   That's a prayer for the church.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.140]   That's a prayer for the nations.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:52.140]   God, in the grand scheme of things, in the gigantic list of everything I could ask of you, above all things, I desire that your name in the heart of all men be separate and exalted and highly esteemed.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:15:07.140]   And then, along with that, because that name is the name of a king, your kingdom come.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   I want your reign to come in me in a greater way.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   Now, young men, let me share with you something.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:22.140]   I, again, what I first believed as a young man has been proven wrong.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:32.140]   And I guess it's because the more light in which you stand, the more darkness in you, you see.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:37.140]   These last few years of my life, my sicknesses, my trials.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:52.140]   They were all keys to open up chambers of my heart and remove idols.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:16:07.140]   So when we pray thy kingdom come in me, Lord, all these little chambers, all these little idols, all this mixture be done with it, Lord.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:19.140]   That every area of my life, every thought be brought into submission, that your kingdom advance through me, in me.
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:23.140]   Your reign, your sovereignty, your kingship.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.140]   And my wife, my wife, oh, Lord, that the kingdom advance in her.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.140]   And my children, my children also.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:33.140]   Let it roll, Lord.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:37.140]   And in the world.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.140]   In the West.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.140]   In Africa.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.140]   The islands of the sea.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.140]   Mongolia.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.140]   Japan.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.140]   Lord, don't forget Japan.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.140]   China.
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.140]   Norway.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:17:00.140]   Paraguay.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:05.140]   Let everyone come under your kingdom.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:10.140]   Be translated from a kingdom of darkness into a kingdom of light.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.140]   You say, Brother Paul, that will never happen entirely.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.140]   I'll let God decide that.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:20.140]   Thy will be done.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.140]   Because kingdom and will.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.140]   A king has a will.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.140]   And to be in that kingdom is to obey that.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:32.140]   I want you to think about something that is spectacular when you understand this prayer.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:38.140]   This should be you should be having prayer meetings in your churches.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.140]   You should be having corporate prayer meetings in your churches.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:45.140]   And how many of them start off by praying for ailments?
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   Now, we need to pray for ailments.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   But the church needs to be taught.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.140]   This is our great ambition that goes before everything.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:59.140]   This is the type of praying that should be seen in congregational praying.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.140]   This is the kind of praying that advances missions.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:06.140]   God, I will have no peace.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.140]   I will give you no rest.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:16.140]   Until your name is hallowed in the heart of every man, woman, and child.
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.140]   Until your kingdom advances.
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.140]   Until your will is complete.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:26.140]   This is my ambition.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.140]   And then every other prayer.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.140]   The prayer for an ailing church member.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.140]   The prayer for everything in our life.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:37.140]   The prayer in every trial fits into this.
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:41.140]   So that we say something like this.
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   Father, I hurt.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.140]   And I'm weak.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:53.140]   And I wish you would take this away from me.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:58.140]   And if by taking these ailments and these trials away from me.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.140]   If by taking them away.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:04.140]   Your name will be more greatly hallowed.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.140]   And your kingdom will advance with greater speed.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.140]   And your will will be more complete in me and everyone else.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:13.140]   Then Lord, take it away from me.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.140]   Take it away.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:20.140]   But Lord, if through this ailment, if through this trial, if through these things.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:23.140]   Your name is more greatly hallowed.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.140]   And your kingdom comes with greater force.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:31.140]   And even I myself am brought into greater subjection to your will.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   Then let it stay.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.140]   Let it stay.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:39.140]   Let it stay.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:44.140]   You see that.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:47.140]   When I see a sick child.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:50.140]   I don't go thy will be done.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.140]   Because I'm not taught to pray that way.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:57.140]   I know I stand in that context.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.140]   I know his will will be done.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.140]   I trust in his sovereignty.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.140]   But that's not the way children pray.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:08.140]   I look and go Lord, I desire, I am burdened for them to be healed.
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:14.140]   And I will wrestle with this matter until you say no.
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.140]   We live a life of prayer.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:19.140]   But here's what you need to see.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.140]   We not only pray that his name be hallowed.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.140]   We not only pray that his kingdom come.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.140]   We not only wrestle that his will be done.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:31.140]   But in that praying we have made a commitment to labor for it.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.140]   To work for it.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.140]   Remember the one who communed with his father in Mark chapter 1.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:39.140]   Says let's get up and go preach because that's why I came.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.140]   It's both things.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:45.140]   You do not let go of the one to take hold of the other.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.140]   But you do both.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.140]   You do both.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:55.140]   Now let me show you something that will transform your life and your church.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:21:00.140]   It's verse 11.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:05.140]   Give us this day our daily bread.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:09.140]   And you say.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:11.140]   If I had a dime for every time.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   The main point brought out of this verse was.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.140]   He doesn't say give me my bread forever.
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.140]   He just says give it each day.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.140]   That's not the meaning here at all.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.140]   It's there.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:25.140]   But it's not the truth to be conveyed.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   Do you know what it's saying?
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.140]   It's saying this Lord, the ambition of my life.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.140]   And imagine when a preacher says this.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:37.140]   Imagine when the entire church says this.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.140]   Lord, the ambition of my life.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.140]   All I care about.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.140]   In all these other details.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.140]   The only thing I am chiefly concerned about.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.140]   Is that your name be hallowed.
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.140]   Your kingdom come.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.140]   And your will be done.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:59.140]   Now, Lord, as a man committed to live for these things.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:02.140]   Provide for me what I need.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.140]   So that I might serve thee.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.140]   That is never separated.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.140]   Give me my daily bread.
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.140]   Give me the resources.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.140]   Provide for me.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:15.140]   That is never separated from this great commission call.
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:17.140]   And this great commission prayer.
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.140]   To do what?
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.140]   To serve him.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.140]   To make these things happen.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.140]   Do you see that?
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:34.140]   Lord, I don't need to be rich.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.140]   I don't need luxury.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:39.140]   I don't need refinement.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:43.140]   Lord, but I do.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.140]   I have committed to your cause.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.140]   And I do need the resources.
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.140]   Feed me so that I can labor for you.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:54.140]   Clothe me so that I can labor for you.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.140]   Lord, you've put it in my heart to help believers around the world.
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.140]   Lord, I petition you.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.140]   Give me what I need.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.140]   And I promise it will not stick to my hand.
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:08.140]   It will go forth and feed your people.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.140]   Help me, Lord.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:12.140]   So we're praying.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:18.140]   But we're not lost in some monkish, super spiritual behavior.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.140]   We're laboring.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.140]   And then he goes on and he says,
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.140]   And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   Verse 12.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:34.140]   The only thing that can hinder you and me.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.140]   And dare I say it?
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:45.140]   Not even principalities and powers and mights and dominions can hinder us ultimately.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:50.140]   The only thing that can hinder us is sin.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:55.140]   Unconvested sin that breaketh not the sinner.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:58.140]   To be holy.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:02.140]   Years ago, Leonard Ravenhill gave me a track.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:07.140]   Said others can, but you cannot.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:12.140]   Others may push their Christian liberties to the ultimate end.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:16.140]   But if you want God's hand on your life, you cannot.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:19.140]   If you want to be used of God, you cannot.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:27.140]   But none of us have entered into what some wrongly call a perfection.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:31.140]   And we will never enter into a perfection until we're called home to glory.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.140]   But we can be broken.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:36.140]   We can be God fearing.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.140]   And we can be broken.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.140]   And we can be transparent.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:44.140]   And we can ask men to pray for us.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.140]   And we can share with them our weaknesses.
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:49.140]   And we can just keep going forward in the grace of Christ.
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:54.140]   Broken men are dangerous.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:25:00.140]   And then do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.140]   The same.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.140]   Do you know what this means?
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.140]   You wake up in the morning, your eyes are opened.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.140]   And you dare not move a quarter of an inch to the left or the right without crying out for grace.
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:18.140]   Because you even know that even in those first few seconds you could betray him.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   I need thee every hour.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.140]   Your problem, brother, is not that you're too weak.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:28.140]   Your problem is you don't know how weak you are.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:31.140]   Your need of him to pray for grace.
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:37.140]   Pray for grace, especially if you've decided that you're going to enter into the battle.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140]   Pray for grace.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.140]   Pray for grace.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.140]   He hates you.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.140]   He hates you.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.140]   The enemy hates you.
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.140]   And make no mistake about it.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:57.140]   He'll destroy you in a millisecond apart from this sustaining, empowering grace of God.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:01.140]   Oh, how weak you are.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:08.140]   Yet how strong can you be in the power of the Holy Spirit?
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:11.140]   Amen.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:24.140]   For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:29.140]   How do I say it?
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:39.140]   I think sometimes with all our cold propositions and our lack of prayer, we've killed the wonder of it all.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.140]   Glory bound we are.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.140]   We serve a king who is incorruptible.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:48.140]   Men were made to do this.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.140]   We serve a king.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:56.140]   Oh, a spectacular king whose beauty is so great if you catch one glimpse of it in prayer,
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:02.140]   it would fracture your psyche into 10 million fragments.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:07.140]   The beauty, not just there's holiness, there's righteousness, there's power,
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.140]   but there's wonder and beauty beyond what the mind can conceive.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:16.140]   Even the most sanctified mind will have to be transformed to behold his beauty.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.140]   And we get to serve him.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:22.140]   And then there's a kingdom, a kingdom that will never end.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:29.140]   I think about the founders of this country and how much they gave to hope to build a righteous land.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:33.140]   A few generations pass after their death, it crumbles into nothing.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:40.140]   And even if it somehow finds a renewal, it will sooner or later crumble to dust.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140]   Man's days are like grass is the flower of the field.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.140]   So he flourishes when the wind passes over him.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.140]   He is no more in the place, acknowledges him no more.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:53.140]   But we serve someone who has numbered every hair on our heads.
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:59.140]   We serve someone whose love.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.140]   You know what, the preaching is painful.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.140]   Do you know why?
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:09.140]   Especially when you talk about this one, of which I'm speaking now.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:11.140]   Preaching is painful.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:16.140]   I don't know how men do it.
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:21.140]   Because even the wonder that you know about him is nothing.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.140]   But even that you can't explain with speech.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:27.140]   I sometimes hate words.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:31.140]   In the middle of the night praying, there's no language.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:37.140]   And when you're preaching, words seem so feeble and just limping on.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:42.140]   His glory, his goodness, his kindness, and what awaits you.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:51.140]   If you could catch one glimpse of glory, you would die 10,000 deaths to make it back there for just one second.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:56.140]   Oh brothers, you are dearly loved.
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:29:04.140]   You are so dearly loved that it pains me to tell you because I cannot tell you enough.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:06.140]   Let me end by saying this.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:09.140]   I want to correct something in your heart.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:14.140]   If you hear nothing from everything that I've said, hear this.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.140]   You need to understand.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:26.140]   The Son of God did not become incarnate and suffer the wrath of God and die for the penalty.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:34.140]   So that the first time you look at him in glory, you see a scowl of disappointment on his face.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.140]   I know that's what you think.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:41.140]   I know that's what you're tempted to believe.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:53.140]   Oh, he will be so much happier to see you than you will be to see him because his capacity for joy is so great.
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.140]   He loves you.
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:58.140]   You must go in the strength of that love.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:05.140]   You must go in the strength of that love.
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:11.140]   Sometimes people fix their eyes on a man who has an extraordinary love for their wife.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:15.140]   And they attribute that extraordinary love to the man.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.140]   Maybe he's not extraordinary at all.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.140]   Maybe he has an extraordinary wife.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:26.140]   And her extraordinary beauty and virtue draws out of his stony heart a passion like no other man.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.140]   That's the same way.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:34.140]   You see someone, a missionary, a preacher, that seems to just burn with a love for Christ.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:40.140]   You need to understand that this person was born of the same fallen stalk of Adam as you
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:43.140]   and was regenerated by the same spirit.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:49.140]   What I have found in church history is that those that seem to rise above others in regard to passion,
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.140]   there's only one reason.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:55.140]   They've seen more of Christ than we have.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.140]   Go after Christ.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.140]   Do you want passion?
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:02.140]   You should come to a conference.
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.140]   It's absolutely wonderful.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:09.140]   But all this preaching and all this music without the Holy Spirit can only wind you up like a toy soldier.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:14.140]   And in three days you'll wind down and find yourself with the same apathy.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.140]   Look for Christ.
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:22.140]   Look for greater and greater pictures of Christ in the Bible and in prayer.
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:27.140]   Seek Him. Seek Him. Seek Him. Seek Him with all your heart.
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:30.140]   Cry out to Him, "I want to see your face.
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:39.140]   I will give you no rest until I see you in a clearer light.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.140]   I must have you.
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:43.140]   I must have you.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:48.140]   I must have you."
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:54.140]   In such praying, He delights.
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:58.140]   In such praying, He delights.
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:10.140]   May God bless you with all the blessings that were purchased for you through the blood of Christ.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:15.140]   Amen.
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:26.140]   [applause]
