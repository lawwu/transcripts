[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - When you meditate, we're all human, we're all mortal.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   When you meditate on your own mortality,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.880]   having achieved a lot of success on whatever dimension,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.320]   what do you think is the meaning of it all?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.600]   The meaning of our short existence on Earth
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.440]   as human beings?
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.440]   - I think that evolution is the greatest force
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   of the universe and that we're all tiny bits
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.840]   of an evolutionary type of process
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.360]   where it's just matter and machines that go through time
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.360]   and that we all have a deeply embedded inclination
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.840]   to evolve and contribute to evolution.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.360]   So I think it's to personally evolve
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.640]   and contribute to evolution.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560]   - I could have predicted you would answer that way.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.640]   It's brilliant and exactly right.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.960]   (whooshing)
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.280]   (whooshing)
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.600]   (whooshing)
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.920]   (whooshing)
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.240]   (whooshing)
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   (whooshing)
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.880]   (whooshing)
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:23.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
