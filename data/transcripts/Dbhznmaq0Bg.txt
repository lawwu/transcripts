[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   If I understand this right, I can book a North America flight, even if it's a short distance,
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.480]   like San Francisco to LA, which sometimes is only 7,500 miles. And then at a date after that,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.040]   I can book a one-way ticket, even if it connects within one region. So like you said, Cape Town
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.200]   to Kenya or to the Seychelles, places where flights are really expensive.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   And then a date after that, just book another flight within North America, LA back to San
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.960]   Francisco. Don't even have to take it. Could conceivably get both your North America flights
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.760]   and the international flight for potentially 15,000 or less miles.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680]   Yep.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.600]   That's amazing. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.400]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel. I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.680]   you're joining me today for a conversation all about points and miles with none other
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.800]   than Julia Menez. She's the host of the Point Strategy Podcast, GeoBreeze Travel,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.680]   where she interviews travelers from all walks of life about their points and miles tactics.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.920]   I know I've learned some great points hacks from her, so it's awesome she's here today.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   We're going to talk about using buyers groups to earn points without increasing your budget,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.080]   stacking deals to get more points, her best cards, Chase's 5/24 rules, some sweet spots
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.440]   to maximize your points, when it makes sense to buy points or put your taxes on a credit card,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.840]   and a lot more. So let's jump in.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.520]   Julia, thank you for being here.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840]   Hey, I'm so excited to be here and to chat about points and miles with you.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.920]   One of my favorite topics. Julia and I, we actually met, for those listening,
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.040]   at a conference called FinCon, where we were both up for the best new personal finance podcast.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.560]   Yours for GeoBreeze Travel and all the hacks for me. Both of us lost, but we both won this
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.360]   friendship. And I'm excited that we got that chance to meet because I've actually... Some
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.000]   of the things I want to talk about today are points and miles tactics that I had not learned
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.400]   about until following you. So I am really excited for this conversation. I just want to jump in
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.560]   and start talking about earning points. So I think one of the topics that I want to start us with
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.800]   is one I get a lot of emails about. And after I published a post about my trip to Bora Bora,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.400]   the first question from a dozen people was, "Well, that's cool. But
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   500,000 points to go on a trip is a lot. How do you get them?"
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.640]   And I have my tactics, but I want to hear from you.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   How do you help people think about starting to earn points on a smaller budget?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.480]   Yeah. So the signup bonuses are going to be how most people are going to earn
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.560]   most of their points. So obviously a lot of people are familiar with the signup bonuses.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.840]   You spent maybe $3,000. In the first three months of opening your car, you're going to get 50 or
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   60,000 points. That's where a lot of your points are going to come from. But a lot of people will
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.640]   react to this and be like, "Okay, but I don't have like $3,000 of stuff that I need to buy.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.840]   We are on a pretty tight budget. What do I do? Do I just not get the signup bonus?"
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.800]   But there's lots of ways around that. If you have a smaller budget, it's going to be really
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.000]   important to find some kind of source of reimbursable spend. And this can be as simple
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.400]   as you pay for dinner for a whole bunch of people and everybody Venmo's you back. That way you get
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.600]   the points for putting the spend on your credit card, but it doesn't really affect your bank
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   account because other people are paying you back. You can plan parties. I know that we just talked
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.360]   on my podcast about you planned a whole bunch of bachelor parties for people in Mexico and got
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   reimbursable spend that way. So you can earn a ton of points by doing that. You can put work travel
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.640]   on your card if your job allows it or any work-related expenses, and then just fill out
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.320]   an expense report. If you're a teacher, we have an episode, I think it's episode 56,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.440]   featuring Zach from Travel Freely. And he was a teacher and had a very small budget,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.160]   but wanted to earn more points. But he was also the tennis coach at that school. So all of their
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.200]   team trips, he would just put it on his card and then fill out an expense report and get reimbursed
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:31.280]   for it. So finding some kind of reimbursable spend is really cool. One of the more advanced ways that
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.560]   people do this is through something called buying groups, which basically there are people who
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:48.640]   like to resale at scale. Think like PlayStations, Apple products, cell phones, things like that.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.720]   Most of the time, if there's a really good sale on an iPhone or an iPad, you're going to be limited
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.760]   for how many you can buy. You can't just run into Best Buy and be like, give me all your iPads. I'm
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.800]   going to resell them right before Christmas, or give me all your PlayStation fives. I'm going to
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.280]   price gouge everybody on eBay who wants this for Christmas for their kid. And so since you're
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.560]   limited for how many you can buy, some people outsource the buying to other people where they'll
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:29.440]   say, hey, I am wanting to resell iPads. I'm offering this much. Get me an iPad, ship it to
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.520]   my place, and I will reimburse you. And so then you go out and source all of these different
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   electronics, ship it to their address, and they pay you back. So this is a way that some people
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.880]   in the points world get a lot of spend. There's lots of different channels that do this for buying
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:54.960]   groups. Some of them are like PFS, NYS Buyers Club, Buy For Me Retail. We have a whole master
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.920]   class about the pros and cons of each one and where you can source all of these different
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.640]   products that you then ship to these different places. But the general mechanics are they put
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.480]   out basically an ad that says, we're buying this. Here's how much we'll reimburse you for. And then
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.280]   you try to source that item at a lower cost so that you're not losing money and then ship it
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.480]   directly to them, and they'll pay you back. Do they usually pay more than it would cost?
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.640]   So there's different ways that can be done. Some of them actually pay a pretty hefty commission. So
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.680]   PFS mostly sources like collectible gold coins from the U.S. Mint. If a coin is going to come
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.600]   out, they're not going to be able to get more than one. So they say, okay, everybody buy one
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.040]   of this coin and we'll pay you the cost of the coin if it's like $3,000 for a collectible or
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   something plus $200 commission. These deals are super rare, but that's the one that will actually
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.800]   pay a lot more. Some other ones, they pay a little bit less than you might just be able to get with
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.360]   a store price. But if you're using that expense to meet a minimum spend on your credit card where
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:13.920]   you're going to be getting $800 of travel vouchers or something, 60,000 points, it could be worth it
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:24.400]   if they say, well, I could buy these for like $3,000. They're only reimbursing me like $2,900
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.560]   or something, but I'm going to get 50,000 points out of it. It could be worth it. There's also
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.320]   other tricks to help make it a little bit better of a return on investment for you called stacking,
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.120]   where if you are clicking through Rakuten and earning some more shopping portal points
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.040]   for buying this PlayStation or this electronic, then that helps to bring your cost down as well.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.640]   So that can help make up for the gap. You're also putting it ideally on a
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.800]   credit card that earns points. And I want to come back to point stacking,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.200]   but buyers groups, it sounds like there needs to be some trust here. I see an ad on the internet
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.880]   that says, "Send all the iPads you want to this random address in this warehouse and we'll for
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.520]   sure send you back money." Are they reliable? Do you trust them? How do you know that you're not
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.160]   buying a device that you are going to mail off somewhere and never get paid back?
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.600]   So they have tracking IDs where they say, "When you order your Amazon thing, put the tracking ID
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.280]   here. Make sure you add this code into the description on the Amazon so we know how to
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   pay you back." They have internal tracking and some of them will pay out faster than others
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:46.160]   so that you can pay off your credit card before the 30 days. And it'll vary on which ones are
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.840]   better than others, which ones are more trustworthy. The ones that aren't as trustworthy
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.760]   will lose their credibility super fast because every points person who's in the buyer groups
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.000]   is going to start complaining about them. So that's one way is to just be in the points
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.160]   community and talk to other people about which buyers clubs they're using and which ones have
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.080]   the best payouts, which ones pay out the fastest, which ones have the best offers,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.720]   and then go from there. And when you say be in the community,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.880]   where are you learning about all these different buyers clubs?
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:24.240]   So I have a Patreon where we have a lot of people who will ask questions on this.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   There's also other Patreons who will talk about buying groups. One is called the Points Analyst
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.360]   on Instagram. He has a Patreon. There's Pack Your Bag with Points. He has a Patreon or a Discord.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.200]   And he talks about a lot of these tactics as well. And then there's just a lot of people
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.320]   on Instagram who advertise that, "Hey, you should use this credit card if you can't meet the minimum
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.960]   spend. I like to use buying clubs. Here's the ones that I use." So there's a lot of us on
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.080]   Instagram who talk about buying groups. Okay. I'm going to ask for a handful of
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.560]   links, including to your content, your masterclass, and I'll put it all in the show notes.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.440]   But this sounds like something you could do to earn a meaningful number of points each year.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.760]   Is that fair? Oh, of course. Yes.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:13.040]   Some people are putting thousands upon thousands of dollars in this to earn lots of signup bonuses,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.000]   just maxing out their 5x categories on Chase Freedom Flex if that comes up. Because
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.440]   one of the main places that people will source from is Amazon.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:29.280]   If you are getting 5 points per dollar at Amazon, then you're going to meet that 1500 cap
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.200]   really fast on a Chase Freedom or a Chase Freedom Flex by doing buy your clubs.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:41.600]   For those of you not familiar, the Freedom Flex and the Freedom card may look like cashback cards.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.240]   When you look at them online, they say, "We get 5% cashback on these categories each quarter."
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.280]   But if you also have a Sapphire Preferred or a Sapphire Reserve, you can actually use the
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.920]   points or the cashback you earn on these cards as points and transfer them places.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   So the same goes with the Freedom Unlimited, which I've talked about a lot as a good companion card.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.840]   So I'm slowly learning that in almost all of the programs, whether it's Citi or Capital One or
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:16.000]   Chase, but not Amex, that if you have cashback cards, you can usually combine the cashback perks
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.880]   with your rewards card and be able to transfer those points as well.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.920]   There's one other app that's really good for meeting minimum spend and getting
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.000]   reimbursable spend. It's called Grabber. So if you travel to Latin America a lot,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.920]   it's spelled G-R-A-B-R, then in Latin America, a lot of the things that we have in the U.S.,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.160]   like iPhones, will actually cost more there because of the taxes and everything.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.520]   So there will be people who are going to say, "Hey, are there any Americans traveling to this
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.720]   city in Brazil? I'd like to buy an iPhone. I'm willing to pay this much."
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.320]   So let's say the price in the U.S. is $1,000. In Brazil, it's going to cost them $1,500.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.080]   They might say, "I'm willing to pay $1,250 for an iPhone." Then you put in your bid
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.360]   and then deliver it to them, meet in a hotel lobby or something in the daytime
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.640]   so that you don't meet in an alleyway, obviously, as you're turning over the phone.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.800]   But they prepay for this. So as soon as you do the exchange, you'll get paid that
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.400]   reimbursable spend as well. So not only do you get reimbursed, but you also get paid
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.080]   a commission for delivering this, and the commission should be enough to cover any
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.280]   kinds of custom taxes that you might have to go through or just the time and effort
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.880]   for hauling stuff in a bag. Don't bring 25 iPhones into Brazil. That looks sus.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.040]   But you can bring a couple iPhones, a couple of other things that people are requesting.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.960]   Medical devices sometimes get requested if they just don't have access to them
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.320]   in those hospitals. So you can bring some medical devices for people in Brazil and
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.480]   they'll pay a commission for it. So that's another way to get reimbursable spend as well.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.440]   And really just pay for a trip to Brazil or Argentina or a lot of other South American
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.920]   countries if you were planning to travel there anyway.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.720]   You talked a little bit about stacking. And I think it would be good
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   to walk through an extreme example of how valuable this can be. So maybe one of your own that you've
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.760]   had recently where you're able to stack as many points as you could on a purchase.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.280]   Because I think sometimes we think about the most obvious way to earn points is sign up bonuses. You
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.240]   get these huge bonuses for spend and then your regular day-to-day spend. If you spend a lot on
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.760]   travel, you spend a lot on groceries, there are cards to maximize that. But every now and then,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.040]   you're making a purchase that's large enough that you're like, "Is there another way to maximize?"
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.160]   And there are. Talk about all the ways that you know that you could stack points together
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.920]   on an expense. What I like to do for excursions a lot is I'll go to Groupon and then find an
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.880]   excursion that I want to do. It'll normally be kind of discounted. Well, then I'm going to go
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.400]   figure out what's the exact amount that I'm going to spend on Groupon. And I'll buy a Groupon gift
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.560]   card through this app called Flues because they're probably going to give me an extra 5% or 6% back
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.080]   just for buying their gift card and that I'm going to go use on Groupon.com. But I don't go directly
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.600]   to Groupon.com. I instead go through Rakuten.com because Rakuten will also give me an extra 5% to
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:33.040]   6% usually for clicking through. I've gotten as high as 18%, I think, if it's like beauty salons
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:39.760]   and spas and stuff. So I'm earning credit card points. I'm earning points through Flues. I'm
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.040]   earning points through Rakuten. And I get a Groupon discount. So that's one example of how
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:53.280]   you can stack things. I try not to go super crazy with stacking like 17 steps because that's 17
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.680]   steps you have to track in each one. Like what if one thing goes wrong? But there's a lot of
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.080]   different ways to automate the stacking. It's really easy to do this with restaurants. So
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:11.840]   you can sign up for airline dining portals, lots of different dining portals. So you just
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.480]   have to link any credit card that you want. And then when you dine at a partnered restaurant
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.120]   with that credit card, then you're going to get extra points through this dining portal.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:28.480]   So in New York, we have a lot of restaurants that are in this dining portal. We also have this app
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.200]   called Seated where you make reservations through this app. You take a picture of your receipt
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:42.240]   afterwards to make sure that your reservation is completed. And they will give you 23% back
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.360]   a lot of the time, sometimes up to 60% back for dining. And if you can do this on a group dinner,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.920]   oh, I think I made like $60 in one weekend because everybody else was from out of town.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.040]   And so there was the group bill. I took a picture of the full group receipt before we split it up
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:06.560]   and earned $60 from some group dinners. So you can stack Seated, you can do the dining portal.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.120]   Can you stack different dining portals? How does that work? I know. And for anyone not listening,
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   a listener, Harish, who's starting a podcast after all the... He heard all the hacks. He was like,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   "I want to do this. It'll be called Hacking the American Dream." And he was like, "Do you talk
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.920]   about dining portals? They're crazy." And so he sent me some screenshots from the Southwest Rapid
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.560]   Rewards Dining Portal. And he's like, "There's a bunch of restaurants. You might not find all
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.280]   the restaurants you want to go to and certainly don't only eat at restaurants for points. My
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.640]   advice is eat for food and go where good food is. If those intersect, that's great. But do you have
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.680]   to pick one? Or can you say, "I'm going to do the American Dining Portal and the Rapid Rewards
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.400]   Dining Portal and, and, and?" Normally, you can only choose one per card. So if I'm using my Amex
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.920]   Gold to get 4x points on dining, I can only link that to one program because most of them are going
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.520]   to go through the same central place and the same restaurants are on most of the networks. So you
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:13.040]   can really just choose one, unfortunately. But you can link it with another app that's kind of
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.400]   like a dining portal called DOSH, where it's the same idea. You just have to link up your credit
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.240]   card and then go to a partnered restaurant or shop with a partnered store, pay with that linked
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.680]   credit card, and then you're going to get some points with DOSH as well. And for super, super
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:36.960]   stacks, Episode 7 of the Geo Breeze Travel Podcast features this girl named Angel Trinh.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:44.080]   You can find her on Instagram @pennywisetraveler. And she stacked like 15 things one time in a
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:53.920]   group outing. She did like an Uber Eats credit, DOSH, Seated, Dining Portals. I think there was
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:59.360]   like a Rakuten thing because she purchased a gift card to use at the restaurant there as well. So
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:07.040]   she was stacking so many different tactics for one dinner. So again, that's Episode 7 of the
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.160]   Geo Breeze Travel Podcast. And that goes into a much more extreme example of how to stack things.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.360]   Awesome. Yeah, I have slowly inched my way into stacking. And the way I often do it is
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:26.480]   I use Cashback Monitor. So anytime Julia mentioned Rakuten, a lot of people know that
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.360]   formerly known as Ebates is a portal you can earn cashback when you're shopping online.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:38.080]   Anytime I'm going to make a purchase online that costs maybe over $100, I'll go look and say,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.480]   "Is there cashback or points?" And the thing Cashback Monitor does that's really cool
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.040]   is they'll show you what are the best places for cashback, transferable points, airline points.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.160]   So if you're watching on video, you'll see 2 chairs behind me. But in the near future,
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.680]   you will see a sofa behind me because this recording studio/office will soon become a
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.640]   guest room as well. And so we needed a sofa bed. And I was like, "Okay, we found the one we liked
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.520]   at Crate & Barrel." And I was like, "Where can I get points?" And it turns out that, yeah, I could
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.680]   get half an Emirates point per dollar or a few other places, but I get 3 JetBlue points per
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:23.440]   dollar. It was the best deal. So before I bought the couch, I went to JetBlue. I logged in. And I
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.760]   ended up transferring... Or not transferring, clicking through their link to purchase the
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.880]   Crate & Barrel couch on crateandbarrel.com, but earning 3 JetBlue points per dollar.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:39.360]   This is a money hack, but you might like it. One thing that I found is there are a lot of ways
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.760]   online you can earn coupons for major retailers. And so one that a lot of people know about is
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.280]   anytime you change your address, the USPS sends you a bunch of coupons to your new address.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.120]   There are websites that sell those coupons to save you the hassle of finding them.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:04.160]   And so right before we purchased the couch on Crate & Barrel, stacking the JetBlue points,
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:11.440]   I went to this website, and it's called saveindeals.com. Like 7deals.com, but S-A instead
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.520]   of S-E. And I tell you, this site looks like it's illegitimate. It does not look like a
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:24.320]   professional website. But what they do sell are Lowe's, Home Depot, and Crate & Barrel coupons.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:33.600]   So I went in and I found a 15% off Crate & Barrel coupon. And for the low price of $3.99,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.680]   I PayPaled a random address. And seconds later, I had an email with a 15% off Crate & Barrel coupon.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.960]   Sometimes you used to be able to find these on eBay. It's become harder to find them.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.280]   A lot of people list them on Craigslist, which is how I found them. I use
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.840]   SearchTempest and search for coupons and it searches like all the Craigslist around the
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:59.440]   country. So you can also stack with coupon codes. I think most people listening have probably heard
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:05.360]   of Honey or RetailMeNot and websites you can get promo codes for. But when you want actual coupon
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.880]   codes with unique barcodes, yes, you can do the change your address, but you can also buy them
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:19.040]   online on sketchy websites. One other place where you can stack so many things is in Las Vegas.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   There's so many different ways to get deals in Las Vegas. So one of my favorite apps is called
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.320]   the My Vegas app. And then you just play these free slot machine games. They give you free tokens
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.000]   every day in hopes that you get addicted to gambling and then put money in their app,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.640]   which I've never actually done. But they give you all of these free tokens and you play little slot
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:46.960]   games and you can redeem the points that you get for free Las Vegas hotel rooms or food or show
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:53.440]   tickets, tons of different things. And it's for the MGM network in Las Vegas. And MGM has a
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.640]   partnership with Hyatt. So here's what you do. Play the My Vegas app, get a whole bunch of points
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:07.600]   that you can redeem for a free room or two, and then go online status match. If you have Hyatt
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:13.760]   Explorer list, you have Hyatt Explorer list or globalist status, then you're going to have MGM
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.760]   gold status, which means you don't have to pay any resort fees at all. So you have a free hotel
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   room where you normally have to pay taxes and fees, but you don't have to do that anymore
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:31.600]   because it's waived with status. And then when you check in, you give them your Hyatt elite ID
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.360]   number, your world of Hyatt ID number so that you're going to earn Hyatt elite nights for staying
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:44.160]   at this free MGM hotel. And that brings you closer towards status so you don't have to stay at nearly
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.840]   as many different Hyatt hotels just to get like the free breakfast or the free upgrades or any of
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.920]   those other statuses for people who really want globalist status but can't afford to stay at that
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.240]   many Hyatts, don't want to put a whole bunch of spend on a world of Hyatt card through buying
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.680]   groups or anything like that. This is a really cheap way to just get elite status with Hyatt.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.680]   How many nights could you conceivably do this for in a year?
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   Like how hard is it to actually earn these MyVegas points that get you free nights?
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:21.440]   Super easy to earn the points, but they limit you to one premium redemption each month. So you can
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.640]   do two nights per month because some of them are for one night free, some of them are for two nights
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:33.840]   free. So you can conceivably get 24 elite nights this way, which is almost halfway to the 60 that
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   you need. Also, you can just pay for the cheap Vegas hotel stays. You can, but don't have to
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.640]   stay there. If you wanted to just book the Excalibur for four nights on like week nights,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.320]   it's like $20 or $30. And then the rest of the steps are the same. Your resort fees are waived.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.480]   Make sure you give them your Hyatt ID upon check-in. Then you just get four Hyatt elite
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.680]   nights for $20 to $30 each. So you can get status really quickly that way.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   Before we jump forward, I want to just highlight some of the crazy
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   amounts of points stacking deals. I'm looking at Cashback Monitor right now,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:21.040]   and I'm looking at the Apple Store, for example. You buy an Apple product, and you click through
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.200]   the Chase portal. If you have a Chase Freedom card, you're going to get two points per dollar
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:32.240]   on Apple. Nike, three points per dollar. Also, through Top Cashback, 10% cashback.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.400]   So this comes to a place where you're like, "Well, what do I really want? Do I want to maximize my
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.360]   points or do I want to maximize cashback?" But some of the deals I've seen have gotten really,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.080]   really lucrative. And I just want to make sure people know that this isn't a place where you
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.560]   could earn a couple points here and there. You can earn thousands of points on a purchase you're
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.640]   already going to make. Also, sometimes Rakuten will increase the amount of points that they're
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.040]   giving for a Marriott or an IHG or something. If you already have a trip booked and the price
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.840]   hasn't changed too much for your dates, cancel that trip and rebook it clicking through Rakuten,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.600]   because then you can get 10% back on IHG or something for a trip you are going to take
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.800]   already and you haven't already paid for. So that's another thing that we do with just
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.360]   getting more points if you're on a small budget without having to spend more than you wanted to
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.920]   spend. Yeah, keep an eye on these portals if you have big purchases. I know our couch, it's not in
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.440]   stock because of all of the supply chain issues. But they told us in our email confirmation,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.320]   "If we have to cancel it, you're okay until it's been confirmed that it's going to ship."
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.520]   So you better believe that I was checking. If for some reason there was a 10% cashback, which
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:50.080]   is not unheard of on some stores. In fact, I think when we bought our first couch from Macy's,
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:56.480]   Macy's is notorious for having some of the highest cashback rates. And I believe we used like a 10%
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.400]   cashback link to buy the first couch. And so I would certainly cancel and repurchase the couch
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.480]   if it ended up being 10% or 20% off because of it. Every now and then I find out there are deals
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:15.520]   to be had that I missed out on. So the charity donation thing in December where people were
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:22.080]   donating money and earning crazy amounts of miles, I kick myself regularly for the fact that I missed
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:28.320]   out on the opportunity. Where are you staying on top of things that are very timely? I know there
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.440]   are certain sources that write really good content. But what are the places you go for
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.600]   the deals that are timely and you need to act on them quickly? Are there specific places?
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   Yeah, so if you follow a lot of us on Instagram who post about these, I post about these and you
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.640]   turn on post notifications, then you'll get alerted. But you can do that with any blogs
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:53.360]   that you follow too. So a few of my favorites, I really like Frequent Miler and Doctor of Credit
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   to stay on top of these different deals. Those are two of the ones that I follow very closely.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.480]   I check it every day. I aggregate all of these into an app called Feedly. So I don't have to go
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:10.720]   to each individual blog website that I read. But you can put on notifications on your email when
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.960]   you're subscribed to their list as well if you really want to jump on things as soon as they hit.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.800]   That brings us to another point. So you use the Feedly app. But
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.920]   what other tools do you use to organize all of this? I know there are points all over programs.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.280]   And one of the things that I've accumulated over the years is small balances in lots of places,
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.320]   keeping track of it all. I know, I think you have a binder with lots of credit cards. How do you
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.600]   organize all this information? Are there tools that you use to stay organized with your points
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.560]   or you use to book things that you prefer? Yeah. So I have different tools for different
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.400]   purposes for figuring out how many points I have with each program. I like to use Award Wallet.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.760]   So it's just one dashboard that aggregates everything into one place for you. So I don't
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.240]   have to go check my Chase account, then my Amex account, then my Marriott account,
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:07.360]   then my Hyatt account. It's all just in one dashboard. And it's free. There's a paid version
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.520]   where they'll actually send you alerts if you have points that are expiring. I like to use this tool
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:19.440]   called Travel Freely to check how many cars have I opened in like the last 24 months so that I know
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.520]   my 5/24 status. I like it because it sends me email reminders when I have an annual fee that's
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.840]   going to come due. So then I can decide, OK, should I hang on to this card? Am I getting enough value
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.280]   out of it? Or should I just downgrade it because I'm not getting enough out of the annual fee?
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:42.720]   So I like Travel Freely because it sends me that reminder to stay organized for which card to use
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.400]   for any given purchase. I like to use an app called Card Pointers. You just tell it what cards you
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.680]   have and what you're trying to buy, whether it's groceries or gas, online shopping, public
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.480]   transportation. And then it'll tell you, oh, based off of the cards you have, here's the one that's
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.320]   going to earn the most points/most value. So you should use this card for your dining purchase.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:13.680]   And it just takes out so much decision making and brain usage if all of this is already calculated
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:20.080]   for me. They also track, in the pro version, all of those Amex credits, like, oh, did I use my
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.480]   dining credit this month? Do I have shopping credits that are left somewhere else? You can
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:30.000]   track those on Card Pointers. So those are three apps that I really like to use to stay organized.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.800]   I want to come back to something you said, which in the miles and points world is really well known,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.000]   but I think for a lot of people listening might not be, which is the 5/24 rule.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.520]   So can you talk a little bit about the 5/24 rule and why it's important for people?
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.600]   Sure. So 5/24 rule is a rule specifically set by Chase that says if you applied for
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.480]   five or more personal cards across any bank, Capital One, Amex, Chase, Citi,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   then you will be rejected on your application for your Chase card if you've already done
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.560]   five or more applications in the last 24 months. And because of that, that's why a lot of points
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.120]   blogs will really prioritize recommending Chase cards to beginners because you can grab
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.960]   five Chase cards and then move on to other banks, but you can't grab like five Capital One,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.680]   Amex, and Citi cards and then move on to Chase because they'll reject you. So that's kind of
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.760]   the order of operations of cards is because of this rule. This rule drives so many decisions
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.320]   that people make with points and miles. And sometimes a good offer comes up and you're
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.680]   already at 4/24 and like it could be worth it to just get the Capital One Venture X
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.400]   or something else. But that's what the 5/24 rule is.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.760]   If you're listening and you're thinking about a Chase card,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.320]   it's always and you think there's any chance you might have opened five cards up
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.000]   in the last 24 months, at least is it just opened or is it applied?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.600]   Okay, so I would recommend anyone who thinks they could be in that camp to check this out before
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.200]   because you're going to get immediately denied from Chase if you have. Is there an easy way
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   to find out if you forget how long you've had certain cards for?
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.000]   I like to use Credit Karma because they're going to have my entire credit history of like when
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.440]   certain accounts were opened so I can use that. But then going forward, once you know how many
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.960]   you've opened, use something like Travel Freely because it's a lot more user-friendly rather than
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.920]   going through the credit history on Credit Karma. Yeah, we're still in early days with all of these
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.440]   points and miles products. And I've talked to the founder of Card Pointers and I just wish that they
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.480]   all started talking to other services more regularly. I don't want to track whether I've
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:52.800]   used my dining credit or Uber credit. I want you to talk to Uber, find out if I have and remind
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.280]   me if I haven't. So I'm hopeful that in the years to come, a lot of these products start to connect
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   to some of the platforms they track. Like Award Wallet connects to some of the points sites so
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.600]   that we can get kind of like really real-time notifications of things. But we've talked about
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.960]   the Card Pointers app before and I'm a big fan but I just feel like there's so much more opportunity
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:21.680]   as a lot of these programs open up and make it easier to share information between each other.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:28.240]   It is worth noting on the 5/24 rule that business cards for Chase are subject to but do not count
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:34.080]   towards 5/24, which is the most confusing thing. So if you are looking at any Chase business cards,
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.400]   if you're over 5/24, you can't get them. It doesn't matter if you have like a separate EIN,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:49.040]   you can't get them until you're back under 5/24. But if you're at 4/24 and then you get a business
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:55.840]   card from Chase or Amex or anyone with some caveats, then you're still at 4/24 afterwards
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:02.080]   because the business cards don't count towards the 5/24 score. There are some exceptions,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:09.120]   TD Ameritrade, Capital One, Discover, I think, but nobody's really using those
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.400]   too often. So most of the time, like with Chase and Amex, you're going to be good.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.680]   We didn't ask this, but I probably should. And I didn't even have it on my list.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.840]   What are your go-to cards?
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.440]   Whatever signup bonus I'm working on is going to be Plan A. And then Plan B is whatever Card
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:29.840]   Pointers tells me to do. For dining, that tends to be my Amex Gold. For rent, obviously, it's
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.280]   going to be Bilt because that's the only one that's going to let me earn points on rent.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:41.040]   Otherwise, most of the time, I'm working towards a minimum spend unless there's like
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.480]   a lot of hotel promos going on, then I'll just use the Hotel Carl Barron card.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.680]   And when you're... Do you have a threshold for when a signup bonus is worth applying for? I think
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.640]   there's always a signup bonus you can find to earn 50,000 points. And there's rarely a signup
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   bonus that'll earn over 100,000. Is there a point at which you see something and you're like,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.920]   "Let's jump on it"?
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.120]   I try not to get shiny card syndrome for seeing different promos. So what I would do instead,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:14.480]   especially for beginners, is pick a trip that you want to take and work backwards from there,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.840]   figure out the different routes that fly into that destination, how many points those routes
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.760]   cost, what kind of points you need, and let that determine what kind of credit cards you're going
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.560]   to open. Don't open cards just because you saw a whole bunch of points influencers post about it,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.360]   and because there's a great signup bonus, but you have no idea how you're going to use those points.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.800]   Because let's say there's a really good Southwest promo, but you're going to be living abroad most
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.440]   of next year, do not get that Southwest promo because it's going to be completely useless to
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.000]   you. So I would say work backwards rather than chasing good signup bonuses.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.560]   How would you recommend doing that? Let's take an example. If someone says, "Gosh,
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.680]   I'm trying to think of what I just got in my email." Someone said, "I want to go to Italy."
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.000]   So they're planning a trip to Italy. Let's work backwards on that process
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.960]   of how do you arrive at which card might make sense?
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:11.440]   So there's a new tool that came out. It's called Point Me, point.me. And this would be the first
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.760]   and easiest step is if you already live near a major airport, you just plug in your airport,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.720]   you plug in wherever you're trying to fly. It will tell you what is the best route for points
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.360]   and how many points you're going to need, what kind of points transfer, what cards will transfer.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:35.200]   So that's like plan A where everything works on the happy path. Sometimes it's going to give you
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.800]   ridiculous results like, "Oh, I want to fly direct from Kansas City to the Philippines
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.600]   on business class." That's just not going to happen. So then you're going to need to probably
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.920]   do a positioning flight to a larger airport and look from there. Always be open to looking at
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:58.480]   surrounding airports or maybe if you live like, I don't know, North Carolina, South Carolina,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.360]   you can position yourself to New York and then fly to Italy from there. Do it in two legs and
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:09.440]   do two different searches rather than just looking straight from North Carolina into Italy and be
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:17.120]   like, "Ah, there's nothing. There's nothing." Or if you wanted to go to a specific island in Thailand,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.240]   do not look for flights directly into that island. Look for flights that go into Bangkok and then
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.080]   take a cheap Thai Airways flight once you're there. So the positioning flights are going
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.680]   to help a lot. Another trick that's really good for figuring out who flies to certain airports
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.200]   is look at that airport's Wikipedia page because it will list all of the airlines that are serviced
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:44.640]   by that airport. And from there, you can kind of figure out, "Okay, are they mostly Star Alliance
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.680]   flights? Are they mostly One World Alliance flights?" And you kind of learn over time who
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.160]   transfers to who. But you can figure that out from just looking at their Wikipedia page.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.560]   I like that. I want to talk about sweet spots for redemptions,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.800]   especially maybe if you don't have a huge balance. I know you've dug into a lot of this,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.920]   taken many of them yourself. What are some really amazing international redemptions?
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:17.120]   So for international or domestic redemptions, you can get anywhere in the US, including Alaska or
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:24.480]   Hawaii on Turkish Miles and Smiles for 7500 points in economy or 12,500 in business class if you can
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.400]   find the award availability. To transfer to Turkish Miles and Smiles, you're going to need
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:34.640]   either city points, built points, or Capital One points. The booking process is a little annoying
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.880]   because you have to call somebody once you find the availability to actually get these seats.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.240]   But if you can get them, such good outsized redemption. You can fly from New York to Hawaii
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.680]   in business class, 12,500 points one way. So that's one for domestic. There's the
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.200]   ANA around the world redemption, which is one of the most popular sweet spots that anybody ever
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:03.760]   talks about. And basically if you have Amex points, you can transfer them to ANA Airways,
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.160]   which is a Japanese airline, and they will let you book up to eight legs in business class
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.000]   around the world. And it depends on like the physical number of miles you're flying,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.760]   but it's going to be like around 125,000 points total for eight business class flights.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.840]   So there are some rules around it. You have to be traveling continuously east
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.960]   or continuously west. You have to have at least one stop in North America, South America,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   one stop in Europe or Africa, and at least one stop in Asia or Australia.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:45.200]   And you cannot cross back and forth between different continents. So like once you go from
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   North America to Europe, you can't suddenly go back to North America, but you can travel
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.840]   around within Europe. You can crisscross back and forth within Europe before moving on to Asia.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.440]   So this is one of the most outsized redemptions ever is the ANA around the world.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.360]   You make me feel bad not talking about it before. You're like, "This is one of the
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.720]   best things." I'm like, "Oh man, this is why we have Julia on the show." Because
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.360]   I remember learning about it a while ago and haven't thought to bring it up. But 120,000
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:23.440]   miles for business class around the world with eight legs is unheard of. So sorry, but keep going.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.880]   So to book this thing, what you do is you search on ANA's website to figure out what the eight legs
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.520]   you want are. And you don't have to have eight. You have to have a minimum of three, maximum of
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.040]   eight. So you find the flights that you want, write down the flight numbers and the flight
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.360]   times and the city, kind of make your itinerary. Then you have to call ANA in order to actually
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.160]   book this because their website cannot handle an eight-legged multi-leg trip.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.720]   Also, you need to transfer in your Amex points. However, it takes three days. So
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:02.800]   in those three days, you have to pray that your availability does not disappear. So you should do
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.080]   this like 10 months in advance so that in case one of the legs is gone in those three days,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:15.120]   you have like backup routes that you can do. Also, if you call ahead of time, like at the
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:21.200]   beginning of those three days, if you get a nice ANA agent, they might hold the space for you
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.640]   while waiting for your points to transfer over. I've never heard that hack of asking someone to
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:33.680]   hold, but be kind and maybe you'll be lucky. I think with ANA, they also have an incredible
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:40.240]   round trip to Japan. I don't know if it's still only 80,000 miles, but one of the better deals.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.800]   And what I say is, look, it can be daunting. If you're transferring all the miles and points you
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:52.960]   have to ANA and relying on them for one specific trip that could be gone by the time three days
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:58.560]   pass, I don't know if that's the best use case. But if you have enough points that you could
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.520]   transfer 80,000 and you know you want to go to Asia, but you're totally flexible when,
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.640]   you can probably make it all work. But I didn't know that you could call and ask them to hold it.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   And if you can get someone to do that and take away all the risk, that's the move.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.840]   You can also, if you didn't want to fly all the way around the world, but you just want to
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:23.600]   experience the actual ANA plane, which is fantastic. It's supposed to be one of the nicest
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:32.240]   first-class products in the sky. You can travel from the US to Japan in first class. I want to
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:38.560]   say it's like 120,000 points round trip, which is crazy good because these flights are $20,000.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:47.040]   And sometimes you can transfer Virgin, you can transfer Amex points or any kind of points that
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:53.840]   transfer into Virgin Atlantic and then book ANA with Virgin Atlantic. And sometimes there will
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   be Amex transfer bonus promos. So you transfer 60,000 points or whatever, you get maybe like a
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:06.080]   20% bonus. So you can do that. You cannot transfer Virgin points to do ANA all around the world,
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.760]   but you can just do it if you want it to fly to Japan and back on ANA's actual plane.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.040]   Any other amazing redemptions? Maybe if someone's trying to go to Europe,
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.720]   where's the sweet spot to book that?
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:22.640]   So I want to talk about a sweet spot across Europe. You can actually do this for like
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.920]   10,000 United points in business class from like France to Greece, which is crazy.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.080]   So this is called the United excursionist perk. We're going to start with a small example and
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.000]   then go into the super hack example. So what this is meant for is if you're doing like a triangle
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   itinerary, like you're flying from New York to London to Paris, back to New York, if you do it
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.280]   all on United points, that middle leg is free as long as the middle leg is in the same region.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:55.440]   So there are certain rules. We're going to assume everybody who's listening to this is based in
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.280]   North America because you can do this for other regions, but for North America, your first flight
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:07.360]   on the itinerary has to start in North America and your last leg has to end in North America
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:15.440]   and your free segment, both ends of it have to be not in North America within like another region.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:22.080]   So Europe is one region. So that's why that itinerary works of New York starts in the
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:28.960]   North America region, fly over to London, London to Paris is both self-contained in a separate
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.720]   region, and then it ends back in New York. So you can do that. How you can super hack this,
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:41.360]   it does not need to be a continuous itinerary. So let's say you went onto Scott's cheap flights or
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:48.320]   something, found a really good deal flying into Paris and you found another really good cash deal
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:54.480]   from Greece back home, but you have no way to connect these two deals. You can actually fly
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:02.000]   across Europe for free, basically free. So here's what you do. So you're in, let's say
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.840]   you're in Los Angeles. You can book a United flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for like
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:14.080]   5,000 points. Then the next thing you search for in your itinerary is from Paris to Athens.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:21.120]   And then the last leg is going to be from, I don't know, another random flight from Los Angeles to
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:28.000]   Las Vegas for 5,000 points. That middle leg is still free because your first flight starts in
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.640]   North America from that random Los Angeles to Las Vegas flight. Your middle leg is completely
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:42.320]   contained in not North America, Europe to Europe, and your last leg, which is another Los Angeles
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.840]   to Las Vegas flight, still ends in North America. So then you just have to fill in the gaps of like,
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.720]   find a cheap cash flight, find another way to get from the US to France, find another way to get
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:58.720]   from Greece back home. But that middle leg is going to be free. Also, that's just an economy
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.880]   thing. If you wanted to book Los Angeles to Las Vegas in business class United, you can get that
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   middle leg for free in business class because it'll match whatever is like the first leg.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.040]   You have to take the first flight or it negates the rest of the itinerary, but the last flight
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:22.160]   is optional for you. So for people who want to just like do like a quick route, or if you already
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.800]   have to take a short domestic flight anyway, and you can plan ahead and structure these itineraries,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.080]   you can fly Cape Town to the Seychelles, which I don't even know how expensive that would be,
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.560]   but you could do that for free if you can structure a United excursionist itinerary correctly.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.400]   If I understand this right, I can book a North America flight, let's say even if it's a short
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:50.240]   distance like San Francisco to LA, which sometimes is only 7500 miles. And then at a
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:56.640]   date after that, I can book a one way ticket, even if it connects within one region. So like you said,
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:02.560]   Cape Town to Kenya or to the Seychelles, places where flights are really expensive. And then a
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:08.480]   date after that, just book another flight within within North America, LA back to San Francisco,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:14.000]   don't even have to take it could conceivably get both your North America flights and the
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.480]   international flight for potentially 15,000 or less miles. Yep, that's amazing. That's a great
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.320]   hack. I'm going to brainstorm ways to use it. If anyone listening has creative ideas on how they
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.400]   could use something like that, definitely reach out. Would love to see all the creative ways they
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.920]   wrote about it. A few other quick things before we go. I've gotten a few questions from listeners
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.200]   that I feel like would be a great conversation. And I want to get your take on some and one is
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.960]   from Eric from Cincinnati, who, you know, I won't say the city's from everyone, but Eric's name in
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:56.000]   his signature or in his email from was Eric from Cincy. So I, you know, it seems fun. Asked if
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.640]   buying points ever makes sense. And I'll give you my perspective. And I want to hear yours.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.280]   And we can go back on a few of these questions. But in general, there are always all these
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:11.680]   promotions that I've seen from airlines from hotel groups to buy points. And they're like,
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:17.920]   "Oh, it's 2x points. Everything's 50% off." My advice has always been, if you have a redemption
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.440]   in mind, it can be a really great deal. Or if the whole world is blowing up about how it's the best
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:30.720]   thing ever, and like, you have to do it, great, which is rare. But otherwise, I see almost weekly
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.760]   some promotion for buying points at a huge discount. And I pretty much disregard all of
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:40.960]   them unless I'm about to do something. What do you think? Very similar thoughts. So do not
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:48.160]   speculatively buy points, only buy them if you already know how you're going to use them. And
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.240]   you've done the math to make sure that whatever redemption value you're going to get from using
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:59.280]   those points is better than the purchase price of those points. Don't buy points for 2 cents
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.320]   for $1. Sorry, don't buy points for like 2 cents per point, and then use them on a redemption where
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.360]   you get one and a half cents per point. So just make sure that you know what you're going to use
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.920]   them for and that you've done the math on it, and then you're good to go. The two exceptions I have
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.080]   are, it might not be a great deal to buy points. But if you are trying to book a flight or book a
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:27.200]   hotel, and you have almost enough, you want to book an award that's 80,000 points and you have
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:32.960]   78,000, and you don't have any way to transfer it in, it could make sense to pay an astronomical
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:38.720]   like 5 cents per point or whatever the fee is to get those last 2000 points to get you this
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:45.200]   amazing reward. That's generally, I think, one of the few use cases, but it falls into exactly what
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.800]   you said. Make sure you have a way you want to use it in mind before you do it. Because just like
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.680]   Mary, it's recently done some devaluation. The last thing you want to do is buy something that
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.080]   sounds like a good deal today, but the program changes and maybe it's not a good deal tomorrow.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.600]   Absolutely.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:09.520]   What about paying taxes on a credit card? I think I had always thought my whole life,
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:16.560]   it would never make sense to pay fees on a credit card purchase. So whenever someone says, "Oh,
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.280]   we'll charge you 3%," before the built card, it was like, "Oh, you can pay your rent, but you have
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.560]   to pay fees with plastic or other services." I was always like, "It never makes sense to pay fees to
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:32.240]   earn points." And then I just started digging into paying taxes on a credit card this year,
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.400]   and I'm not sure I agree anymore.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.240]   It can be a really good way to meet minimum spend if you don't have another way to easily
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:47.680]   meet your minimum spend. So for example, the Amex Business Platinum has $15,000 minimum spend,
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.240]   which is a lot. And so if you don't want to do buying groups or any of the other reimbursable
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.960]   spend things that we talked about earlier on in the episode, it can make sense to just pay an
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   extra 3% to get that 120,000 point bonus on the Amex Business Platinum. So if you're going for
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:19.680]   something like that, or you have Hilton Surpass where you get a free night if you're putting $15,000
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:29.120]   on the card each year, if you're going to get whatever 15,000 times 3% is at least that much
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:35.040]   value out of your free hotel night at some Waldorf Astoria, it could be worth it to do it for
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.880]   something like that, or just to cap it if, "Oh, I'm 10,000 of the way there. I have no other way
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.640]   of getting that 5,000." Then it might be worth it if you want to put your taxes on a credit card
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.760]   and pay that extra fee.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:54.080]   So I started looking into this and I realized most of the places you pay for things online
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:00.880]   on a credit card, the fees are pretty high, 2.5%, 3%. I've seen 4%. What I realized was that the
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:06.160]   fees to pay your taxes on a credit card are actually lower than I expected. So there are
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:15.360]   3 sites the IRS shows. The lowest one is pay1040.com and the fee is 1.87% this year.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:23.120]   So I was thinking, "Gosh, I have a Venturex card." And at the worst case, you can redeem
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:30.720]   your points, which you earn 2 of at 1 penny, booking travel. So 2 cents per dollar spent,
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:37.120]   so 2% cash back. Also could do it with a Citi Double Cash or any card that pays 2% cash back,
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:41.200]   you would actually net a profit paying your taxes on your credit card.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.600]   Now, I quickly thought, "Ooh, who doesn't want a free profit?" So I was like, "Hmm,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.560]   what if I put $10,000?" I'm not saying I owe 10,000 or you would, but just to
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.440]   illustrate the example. And I realized if I'm going to put $10,000 on a credit card,
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:03.520]   and I'm going to pay a fee of $187, but I'm going to earn 2%, which is $200. I'm literally going to
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:10.560]   make $13. And that's for a $10,000 tax bill. So I thought, "Okay, this is not a way to make money.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:18.560]   This is not a way to rack up points at the IRS's expense. But what it is, is a great way to meet
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:26.400]   minimum spend." So if anyone's listening, and they had a business and they signed up with Capital One's
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:35.680]   Spark Cash Plus card, it had the most egregious minimum spend, which was $50,000 in 6 months.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.880]   And now all of a sudden, I'm thinking, "Maybe I should lower my deductions from work for my
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:46.880]   withholdings from work on my taxes so that I owe the IRS money so that I can put some spend on this
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:54.080]   card." But at 1.87%, I think it could work really well for meeting minimum spend and not losing
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:01.760]   money. But it's probably not a way to generate a return. If you overpay your taxes, the IRS will
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:09.840]   issue you a check back. It's very slow. They're very slow to do this. But if you wanted to pay
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:18.800]   them $50,000, they will probably send you a check back 6 months later for $40,000 in this example,
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:24.560]   and then you earned your bonus. So that is a strategy some people do. I don't want to be that
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:30.640]   leveraged for $50,000 for 6 months. But some people do things like that.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.200]   Yeah, I definitely do not want to owe... Especially on a card that's a charge card.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:43.520]   Maybe if it was a 0% APR card, you could carry it. But I did realize that if you're trying to
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:53.040]   meet a minimum spend in 2022 at 1.87% on the right card, it has to be a card that's earning you 2%
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:58.400]   back or more. Otherwise, you'd be losing money. But I've turned my position on this a little bit,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:05.280]   and I think it could make sense. Last few things. I got an email from a woman named Brandy,
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:12.000]   who pointed out something that I didn't realize. I'm not in the military, nor is my spouse.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.800]   But I recently learned and wanted to share that if you have a Chase, an Amex, or a CityCard,
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.240]   and you are in the military or your spouse is in the military,
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.120]   they will waive your annual fees on all the cards.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:31.920]   I looked at the list. It's Chase Reserve. It's Amex Platinum. Real cards with high annual fees.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.160]   I know you've done an episode on a lot of these things. I wanted to
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.800]   hear your take on this and other perks that might apply to people in that situation.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.960]   They'll waive it on all personal cards. Unfortunately, they won't waive it on
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.440]   business cards if you're trying to get the Chase Inc. Business Cash or the Amex Business Gold.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:56.320]   But for all of the personal ones, yes, you don't have to pay the $700 on the Amex Platinum,
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:01.360]   which is amazing. We actually have an episode that covers a lot of different military benefits.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:08.640]   It's episode 67, featuring Mark White. He's in the military. He talks about the waive fees.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.440]   You can get into different lounges for free with military ID if you're traveling.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:20.240]   You can get free status with Caesars. I don't know if they still do this because
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:25.360]   they recently changed their program. But it used to be that you would get automatic platinum status
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:31.680]   for both the military member and their spouse. And each of those would get you three free nights
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:39.120]   at the Atlantis in the Bahamas. So six free nights for an Atlantis Bahamas vacation for a couple.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:44.240]   So lots of different tricks like that. More of them in episode 67 to talk about lots of
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:50.080]   different military benefits and places that you can get discounts or just extra perks for military.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:56.960]   And one thing you told me, there's a site called ID.me, where it's not just military. There are
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:04.400]   other branches of healthcare and I think education, maybe, where you can go link up your email to
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.640]   prove that you're in that group or even verify it in other ways and get access to a lot of perks.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:14.640]   Yep, absolutely. Travel perks, different discounts with different stores, restaurant things. So
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.560]   if you're a student, a teacher, government worker, healthcare worker,
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.360]   military, you can go to ID.me and check for all of these different discounts.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:30.400]   Awesome. Last thing I want to share is I've talked numerous times on the podcast and gotten
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:36.240]   so much great feedback from listeners getting upgraded around the world by sending a note
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.920]   into the hotel after booking directly with them. And people have asked me, "What is the message
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:48.720]   you send?" And I've always given really generic advice that was, "Oh, just say, 'Hey, I'm coming.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:54.640]   These are my dates. This is what I'm doing.' And I want to share your link, which Julia has set up.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:01.760]   Let us know where to go for your guide to exactly what template you should send to a hotel to
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.960]   maximize your chance for an upgrade. So I made you guys a special link. It's
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:11.920]   at GeoBreezeTravel.com/allthehacks. It'll take you directly to the template that I've used to
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:17.440]   get some amazing upgrades. I look forward to more conversations like this down the road.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.240]   Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:33.680]   Thank you.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:38.760]   [music]
