[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   A listener named Fano writes in, "Hello Pastor John, if Christ is the only one that can truly
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.840]   satisfy my hunger for joy, why then do I seek to excel in what I do?
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.600]   What I do brings me joy, and I also feel like it brings glory to God too, but I get confused
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.840]   about joy.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.220]   If God is my joy, why do I care in making the perfect meal or writing the best paper
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.220]   for academia?
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.560]   Thank you for any help you have to offer."
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.160]   What would you say to Fano?
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.120]   I love this question, and I found myself, as I was thinking about it, just soaring.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   I love to think about the relationships of the enjoyment of God with the things that
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.720]   God has made and the activities He designed us to perform.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.520]   This question is so unbelievably important.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.440]   So I, however, empathize with Fano's perplexity.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.540]   It is one thing to enjoy the simplicity of delighting in God Himself and delighting in
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.960]   His gifts and delighting in activities that He's equipped us to do.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.480]   It's quite another thing to articulate with words how all of this fits together, without
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.560]   contradicting any scriptures and without demeaning any of God's gifts.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.120]   So for those of you listening in who simply want to go on your way full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   overflowing with proper enjoyments without complicating your life with explanations
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.640]   in words that get all tangled up in complexity, then I say, with John Owen, I bid you farewell.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.120]   If you want to keep listening, I'm going to go into the tangle and see if we can sort
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   it out.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.680]   At least I need this very much, and it sounds like Fano does, too.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.040]   So let me simply set the stage for the answer by drawing attention to a batch of relevant
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.720]   passages from the Bible which show that Fano's question is necessary.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.160]   It's demanded by text, not just by experience.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   So first you've got Psalm 73, 25, "Whom have I in heaven but you, O God?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.920]   And there is nothing on earth I desire besides you."
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.840]   I mean, think of that statement, "Nothing on earth I desire besides you.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.040]   My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.800]   And then you add to that Philippians 3, 8, where Paul says, "I count everything as loss
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.620]   because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.600]   For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.360]   Count them as rubbish that I may gain Christ."
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.920]   I think the point of those passages is not to say there can be no legitimate pleasure
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.960]   in God's gifts.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.320]   Too many other texts contradict that idea.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:13.720]   But the point is, only in God, or supremely in God, we find our pleasure.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.360]   Those texts are intended to say that compared with God and compared with Christ's beauty,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.920]   all other gifts, including rewarding activities that he gives us to do, are as nothing, like
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.840]   dust in the balances.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.160]   That's how much our delight in God himself, how much the glory of God compares to the
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.280]   gifts, the glory of his gifts.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.200]   So I don't think those texts are designed in the Psalms or anywhere else as canceling
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.040]   out the legitimacy of a proper enjoyment of God's gifts.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.360]   The big question is, okay, what does proper mean?
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.480]   And we start stumbling upon texts like this.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.560]   Philippians 4, 11, "Therefore my brothers whom I love and long for, my joy and crown,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.980]   stand firm thus in the Lord."
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.160]   So here we have Paul, who just said he counts everything as rubbish compared to Christ describing
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:26.400]   the fruit of his apostolic labor in the people at Philippi as his joy and his crown.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.280]   And when he does it, he's not being an idolater.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.360]   Then we have the same Paul saying in 1 Timothy 6, 17, "To the rich, don't be haughty, don't
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.060]   set your hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.060]   to enjoy."
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.520]   So set your hope on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:05.540]   So now we have an enormous material, relational, intellectual, artistic truckload of blessings
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:16.740]   poured out by God on us with the divine intention that we enjoy them without becoming idolaters.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.140]   And then we have Paul saying to the Ephesian elders, and I'm going here because of Fano's
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:30.460]   question about activity, actions, he enjoys actions and behaviors and writing and so on.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.700]   Paul said in Acts 20, 35, "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, 'It is more
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.340]   blessed, happy, satisfying to give than to receive.'"
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.740]   In other words, if you are performing an act of giving, and that could be giving of any
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.300]   kind, right, it could be giving your time, giving your skill, giving your words, giving
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.220]   your money, then this should be experienced as blessedness.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.020]   In other words, it should be enjoyable.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.320]   I think that's what that text says.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.940]   He said the same thing in 2 Corinthians 9, 7, "Each one must give."
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.800]   Money is in mind, but any giving would be true.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   One must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, because
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.320]   God loves a cheerful giver.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.560]   In other words, when you're not merely receiving from God the enjoyment of his fellowship,
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.020]   but rather turning it outward towards other people and engaging in activities of giving
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.860]   yourself away, giving your gifts away, time, talent, giving it all away, you should be
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.560]   doing it with cheerfulness.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.000]   You should be enjoying it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.760]   And the same thing pops up in, I know Ecclesiastes is notoriously difficult to interpret, but
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:08.180]   I think we can agree that some things, however you interpret Ecclesiastes, some things are
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:14.100]   repeated so often, they're so unqualified, they're so related to God's will that we
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.680]   know they're intended by the inspired author to be embraced.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.600]   And here's an example, three examples.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:28.560]   Ecclesiastes 2.24, "There's nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.120]   and find enjoyment in his toil."
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.760]   And then he adds, "This also I saw is the hand of God."
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:45.720]   And then Ecclesiastes 3.13, "Everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in his toil."
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.000]   And then he adds, "This is God's gift to man."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.160]   And then chapter five, verse 19, "Everyone is to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil."
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.600]   And then he adds, "This is the gift of God."
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.400]   And of course, everything we've seen now, everything we've seen so far, fits in with
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.760]   God's original purpose for man on the planet, that we have meaningful work to do, and that
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.480]   was not a result of the fall that we have to work.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:24.640]   Rather, Genesis 1.28, "Before the fall, God blessed man," woman, "said, 'Be fruitful,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.400]   multiply, fill the earth, subdue it, and have dominion over it.'"
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.360]   Or when he put Adam in the garden, he said, it says, "The Lord took the man, put him in
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.200]   the garden to work it and keep it before the fall."
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.120]   And of course, before the fall, he didn't mean and find it boring and begrudged getting
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   up in the morning.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.080]   He meant, "Go at it with all your heart and mind and find joy in it," just like Ecclesiastes
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   said.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:06.560]   So, here's my very short and tangled, and I think exciting, answer to how joy in God
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.320]   fits together with the calling that is on us to enjoy God's gifts and to enjoy the work
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.400]   that he gives us to do.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   I've got three or four steps.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:23.960]   Number one, our work and the enjoyment of it and the enjoyment of God's gifts in it
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.800]   is the overflow of joy in God himself.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:38.080]   In other words, our enjoyment of our work or our enjoyment of God's gifts should be
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:47.120]   an enjoyment of honoring what God has given us and what he has done for us.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:54.200]   He causes us to enjoy his gifts as an overflow of the enjoyment of himself.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.520]   And the reason I say that is because of 2 Corinthians 8, verse 2, "Their abundance of
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:08.880]   joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed," there's my key word, and that's in the
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.320]   Bible, "have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part."
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:24.440]   So they are undertaking activities of giving and serving, and those very activities are
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   called overflow of joy.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:36.080]   First, we taste the kindness of God in the gospel, and everything else becomes overflow.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:44.640]   Second, in all our enjoyment of God's gifts, including the gift of meaningful work, we
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:51.520]   are tasting something of God himself in his gifts.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.260]   God created things as good because he is good.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:03.520]   They are expressions, they are aspects of his goodness, and we should learn to enjoy
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:12.460]   the sweetness of the peach because there is something of God's sweetness in the sweetness
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.840]   of the peach.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:22.440]   Third, when we do our work conscious of being created by God, dependent on God, gifted by
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:30.080]   God for certain work, motivated by God, being eager to do it as to God, then we can say
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:38.400]   that our very work is—this was kind of a fresh insight for me—our very work is an
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:49.720]   embodiment or an incarnation of the very glory of God that delights us, and thus we find
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.160]   our work delightful.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:12:01.360]   Delightful, precisely in proportion to the way it reflects the glory of God in which
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.880]   we delight.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.960]   In other words, all the aspects of our working—think about it—all the aspects of our working
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.280]   are thinking, the working of our muscles, the working of our nerves, the working of
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.200]   our eyes and ears, the emotional capacities we have to relate to people, and on and on
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   and on.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:28.240]   All the aspects of our working, all of this is designed by God to show the glory of God.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.400]   And we love the glory of God.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.520]   We delight in the glory of God.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:40.000]   And when all of that comes into play in God-honoring work, we enjoy that work because we experience
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.380]   this work as the very embodiment of the glory of God.
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:50.280]   How else could it be if God is creating all those possibilities for us as a demonstration
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.520]   of his glory?
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:58.100]   And finally, I would say all of our working, all of our ministry, all of our activity should
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:07.400]   be the pursuit of an enlargement, not just the overflow of, but the enlargement of our
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:15.200]   enjoyment of God himself, in the sense that we want the fruit of our lives to be such
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.300]   a display of the all-satisfying glory of God that other people see it.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:28.340]   Other people see it and come to share in it so that our joy in God is enlarged by their
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.320]   joy in God.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.760]   So that's my best effort, Fano.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:41.520]   I hope in the piling up of words, there is at least a smidgen of truth and insight that
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   happens.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   Wonderful.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.440]   little story holds cosmic importance, just like our own lives.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.280]   I'll see you tomorrow.
