[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we continue our disability insurance series.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.240]   We're going to talk about why is it so hard to compare disability insurance policies.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.600]   Also, should you buy long-term disability or short-term disability?
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.000]   We're going to talk about benefit periods, elimination periods, and continuance provisions
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.640]   such as non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policies.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.640]   Exciting stuff on today's show, if you're a nerd who cares about spending your money
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640]   wisely.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast, the show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.720]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.120]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.140]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.720]   And today I try to equip you with some very important financial knowledge so that you
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:16.960]   can protect yourself with disability insurance and not get taken to the cleaners in the process.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.920]   The last episode in this series, we talked about why disability insurance is important.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.880]   I gave you my sales job on it.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.720]   I heard, I just got a note on Twitter from one listener that said, "All right, Joshua,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   you convinced me."
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.640]   So at least I convinced one person to go ahead and consider buying disability insurance and
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.200]   that makes me very happy.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   So I'm happy about that.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.360]   So I've convinced you, hopefully, at least some of you to consider it, but now I've got
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.040]   to equip you with the knowledge to be able to make a good decision for that.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.120]   And this is one of the more challenging areas of insurance to teach on because there is
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.200]   so much variability in the product line and there's so much variation between different
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.640]   companies, between different policies, et cetera.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.520]   And this is going to be one of the areas where you will need somebody knowledgeable in your
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.320]   camp, which is a convenient time for me to do today's ad, which is Paladin Registry.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   Paladin Registry is a registry service for financial advisors.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.200]   I went and found them when I was looking to figure out where can I send you guys who are
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.520]   looking for financial advisors, where can I send you to at least get a start and have
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.200]   a hope of finding somebody who's competent and who's caring and who is hopefully honest
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.680]   and will deal with you forthrightly.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.720]   The best place that I found so far is RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.080]   It's in a relationship I set up with Paladin Registry.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.040]   Paladin Registry is a financial advisor referral service set up by their founder, Jack Waymire,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.360]   who was frustrated with the same thing I was frustrated with.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600]   How can we vet financial advisors?
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.640]   So they went through and they developed a point of vetting financial advisors, checking
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   their backgrounds, checking their qualifications, checking their work history, checking their
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.680]   disciplinary actions, et cetera.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.520]   And only advisors who get through that rigorous screening process are listed in the registry
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   service.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.040]   So if you're looking for a financial advisor, consider going to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.840]   That link will auto-forward you through to a landing page where you'll put in your name,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.520]   your address, your phone number, the amount of assets that you have, and any other pertinent
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.120]   information to the areas that you're interested in.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.080]   Paladin will take that information and they will filter it to find an appropriate advisor
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   for you.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.920]   If you've got $100,000, they won't send you to an advisor who has a million dollar minimum.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.400]   If you've got $5 million, they won't send you to an advisor who's only got a $100,000
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   minimum.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.200]   So they will filter that through appropriately and they'll put you in touch with a couple
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   or three good advisors in your area that you can start with.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.200]   I can't promise you two things.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.080]   I can't promise you you're going to find a great financial advisor there, but I can promise
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.600]   you it's a good place to start your search and interview those advisors.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.680]   A good interview with a financial advisor should be like a job interview.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.600]   You're interviewing them to do a job for you.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.640]   So interview them, ask them your questions, and see if they might be a good fit.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.100]   The second thing I can't promise is that they're going to be experts in disability insurance.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.100]   They might not.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.680]   And this is leading us right into the very first point on my outline here, which is why
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.040]   it's so hard to work and find and compare work in the areas of disability insurance.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.320]   It is tough, and as I said in the last show on this topic, many advisors just walk away
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   from it.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   They throw up their hands.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.680]   I've had multiple advisors who told me to my face and just kind of professional content,
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.000]   I just don't even bother talking about disability insurance anymore.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.480]   It's too hard to sell.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   Nobody wants to buy it.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   They don't understand it, et cetera.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.200]   So I don't even bother to talk about it.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.400]   Well, in my mind, that's a breach of duty.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.520]   It's a breach of professional duty.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.040]   I think it's a breach of professional duty if a financial advisor who's working with
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.960]   a family who needs disability insurance and doesn't at least work very diligently to
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.280]   get them to buy it first before anything else for the reasons I articulated in the last
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.920]   show in this series.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.640]   But it's also just – well, but it's a reality.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.200]   Comparing disability insurance is hard and that's one of the reasons why you don't
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.240]   hear it discussed either with advisors or even in a public format like today.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.720]   Tell me when the last time you heard an in-depth discussion of disability insurance on a financial
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   radio show or a financial podcast of any kind.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.560]   I've never heard it that I know of.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.000]   The deepest it goes is maybe should you buy long-term disability or short-term disability
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.120]   insurance.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.700]   But that's just scratching the surface of the options and it is tough and that's again
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.200]   why we don't hear it discussed.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.680]   Today's show is going to go right over the heads of many of you and I don't think necessarily
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.560]   you need to grasp all of this information.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.680]   But I'm going to do my best to keep it simple so you at least can develop an understanding
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.520]   of the vocabulary.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.640]   So when you're working with an insurance agent, you can feel a little bit more confident
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.880]   in understanding the presentation that's being made to you.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.040]   The first thing to start with is vocabulary in any area of learning.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.640]   If you look at the historical model of learning, which is most popular, it's not the only
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.280]   model but the most popular one is expressed in the classical trivium, which was the idea
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.840]   of grammar, logic and rhetoric.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.080]   The first stage of learning is grammar, is learning the grammar of a subject.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.680]   So today's show, that's essentially what we're doing.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.080]   I'm going to teach you the grammar of disability insurance and I hope that it will be helpful
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   to you.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.960]   But it's tough to compare among – it's tough to compare among companies because there
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.160]   is such a variation of products.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.040]   It's also tough because there's a variation of the internal policies and everything is
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.080]   based in a disability contract upon the actual contract.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.120]   There are some standardized products that fit – that you can compare things like prices
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   among.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.360]   But even those, if you brought me a disability policy and I wanted to beat it on price, I
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.900]   could beat it on price almost every time and you might never know the option that I changed
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.080]   internal to the contract unless I told you, unless you read the contract.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.040]   And since unfortunately people don't read insurance contracts, you would probably never
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.520]   know.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.640]   So it's just challenging to adjust among these things.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.360]   I'm going to talk – I could talk in the future about many different types of products.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.500]   But today, we're just talking about individual disability insurance, individual disability
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.040]   insurance.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.120]   And the reason I'm talking about why it's so hard to compare is to demonstrate to you
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.100]   that you can't just shop based on price.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.240]   In the life insurance marketplace, if you're going to shop for 20-year term and you're
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.760]   going to shop that with other companies for 20-year term, 20-year term, 20-year level
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.840]   term is pretty much the same at most companies.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.040]   You can have a few riders, a few benefits change.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.320]   You can add a little something here, take a little something away.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.920]   I've covered that in previous life insurance episodes.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.040]   But 20-year term is 20-year term.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   It's a pretty standardized product.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.240]   But individual disability is not individual disability across the market.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.040]   It's all of these things, which makes it very difficult to compare companies and prices
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   and policies.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.760]   But let's start with the biggest question that I usually hear.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.320]   "Joshua, should I buy long-term disability insurance or should I buy short-term disability
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.440]   insurance?"
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.640]   This is one of those words that many people have heard about and this is one of the debates
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.240]   that does happen to a small degree in the personal finance world, long-term disability
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.880]   versus short-term disability.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.240]   So let me explain what these are.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.600]   A long-term disability insurance policy is a policy that will pay you money over the
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.080]   long term if you're disabled for a long time.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.560]   A short-term disability insurance policy is a policy that will pay you money for a short
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.960]   time if you're disabled for a short time or if you're disabled for a long time.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.400]   It will just only pay you in the beginning.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   That's how it works.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.320]   Now, the first thing you need to understand about this is that the shorter the period
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:58.000]   of time that you're measuring for disability, the more likely the disability is.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.960]   Almost all of you listening to this show will have had at some point in your work life a
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.520]   day in which you couldn't work or at the very least an afternoon in which you couldn't work.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.760]   Perhaps you had a headache.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.080]   Perhaps you started throwing up at 11 o'clock in the morning at the office and you got in
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.800]   your car and you stumbled home and you went to bed.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.360]   Now, you may have been better the next day, but almost everyone in the audience has experienced
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.120]   at least an afternoon off of work or a day off of work.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.400]   I don't know if it's 100%, but I would feel pretty confident that it's close to 100% of
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   people have experienced this.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.280]   What you can see in my example that if you've had a day off of work due to sickness, you're
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.240]   thus disabled because of your sickness.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.640]   You're not able to do your work.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.040]   You're disabled.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.960]   You have been disabled at some point in the past.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.800]   So it's very likely that at some point in the future, you will be disabled and not able
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   to complete a day of work.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.280]   That's very likely.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.200]   Now, if we extended that period out a little bit, say from one day of missed work due to
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:11.080]   sickness or injury to one week of missed work due to sickness or injury, there would still
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:20.000]   be many of you who have experienced that, but it would quickly drop down from 100%.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.440]   Many of us have been out of work for a week or close to it.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.680]   Perhaps we were out of work for a week if it was close to Memorial Day or Labor Day,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   but the point is that the percentage of people who've experienced that has dropped down,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.640]   but it's still pretty high.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.360]   And you can most likely concede to me the point that it's pretty likely that at some
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:47.000]   point in the future, something will happen that will knock you on your back for a week.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.560]   Thus the probability is high.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.960]   If we extended that out to a month, the numbers would drop dramatically.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.000]   Far fewer of you have been disabled for a month.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.080]   I've never been disabled for a month and far fewer of you ever have and far fewer of you
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.600]   ever will.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.280]   If we drop it or extend it out to three months, now the numbers plummet even more.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.760]   If we extend it out to a year, the numbers plummet even more.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.720]   If we extend it out to five years or 10 years of disability, the numbers plummet even more.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.320]   And so the shorter the amount of time of disability, the likelier it is that you'll be disabled.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.640]   The longer the time of disability, the less likely it is that you'll be disabled.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.360]   Now to compare likelihoods, just consider your own personal experience.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:39.720]   I dare say that most of us know at least somebody who's been permanently and totally disabled.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.240]   Or if you don't know them, you know of them.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   One simple example, just consider people with learning disabilities.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.620]   Consider people who have lifelong conditions like Down syndrome or some other similar thing.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.320]   Consider people that you know who may be struggling with muscular dystrophy or consider somebody
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.040]   that you know who may have had a back injury and had to change their job.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.720]   All of those things count as disabilities.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.240]   But still, it's much less likely that you'll be disabled for a year than that you'll be
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.560]   disabled for a day.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.840]   Now should we buy insurance for that?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.280]   Well here's where we go to the significance of the disability.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.240]   If you were out of work for an afternoon, would that impact your financial situation
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.760]   seriously?
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:31.960]   The answer is no, only at the most basic of employment levels where people are working
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.320]   a minimum wage job and they're stretched to the max does an afternoon of missed work
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.440]   spell the difference between being current on a bill or being late on a bill.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.560]   Most employers, especially many of you listening who are in salaried positions, most employers
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.760]   will not even acknowledge the absence.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.120]   Now some employers will.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.160]   A day of missed work for many people is not a big deal.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.600]   Again, it's only at the most basic poor levels of society at which a day of missed work is
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.880]   going to upset a financial plan.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.800]   If you go out to a week, some people can absorb a week of missed work and missed pay.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.160]   Some people can absorb a couple weeks and some people could absorb a few months.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.680]   When you start to go out beyond a few weeks or a few months, the ability to absorb the
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   financial impact of the disability is much more difficult.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:34.160]   Whether that's because of the challenge of having a year's worth of savings, most US
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.080]   Americans can't put together four or five hundred bucks for an emergency.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   I can't remember.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.320]   I was reading some of the numbers that came out recently.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.840]   I think it was from the Federal Reserve.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:47.180]   They're talking about, what's it, 40% or 40% or 50% of US Americans can't put their hands
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.680]   on a thousand bucks.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.520]   Just did a quick web search to try to clarify that.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.200]   I guess some of the news articles, it looks like 62% of Americans have less than a thousand
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.280]   dollars in their checking and savings accounts.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.800]   So a couple of stories and ways to spin that data.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.360]   Let's just keep it simple.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.800]   So the majority of US Americans don't have a thousand dollars.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.640]   Well, in that kind of situation, if you miss a few weeks of work, it's pretty tough and
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.680]   it leads to missed payments, bounced checks, etc.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.380]   So that can be very, very challenging for many people.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.080]   But even in these shorter periods of time, there are other systems of support.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.880]   Family and friends, church groups contribute money, will help out.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.360]   So these shorter amounts of disability, shorter time periods of disability, there is an ability
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.280]   to work through them.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.160]   Much harder to work through a year.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:48.080]   People's charity and their ability to help is often stretched thin the longer it goes.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.400]   So when looking at long-term disability versus short-term disability, I think it's important
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.560]   to have a practical perspective on this.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.720]   Usually short-term disability is defined as a disability that lasts anywhere from a week
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.120]   or two weeks up through a few months, three months, although it could go as long as a
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.260]   year.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.800]   So anywhere from this couple weeks to three months is usually considered to be a short-term
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.680]   disability.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.360]   Long-term disability is usually considered to be from three months out through as long
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   as perhaps age 65 or age 70.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.580]   Used to be able to get a lifetime disability insurance policy where if you got disabled,
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.420]   you would get a benefit for life.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.200]   Now most of the – that's no longer available to my knowledge.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.520]   Has not been available for many years.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.760]   It went away a decade or two ago.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.080]   And now the latest you can go is usually through about age 70.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.240]   Many policies are renewable until 65 and conditionally renewable until 70 as long as you're still
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.040]   employed with limited periods.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.520]   I'll cover conditional renewability toward the end of today's show.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:53.020]   So disability – that's the difference between the short-term disability and long-term disability.
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.780]   Now let's put our thinking hat on for a moment and let's not make any blanket statements
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.160]   about whether you should buy one or shouldn't buy another.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.460]   And let's think about who should buy one and who should buy another.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.120]   But first, we got to talk about premiums.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:14.440]   The total benefit that you can get from a short-term disability policy is relatively
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:23.040]   small but the likelihood of using it is relatively high.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.380]   So let's assume that you are going to get a policy that pays you after two weeks and
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.040]   pays you out through a total of three months of disability.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.920]   Well if your policy is going to pay you say $3,000 for three months, the total maximum
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.760]   benefit from the policy is $9,000.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:47.360]   That's a relatively small risk for the insurance company.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:57.360]   Thus, the price of short-term disability insurance policies is usually relatively low.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.000]   The biggest player in this space is Aflac, the little duck.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   You've all seen their commercials.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.700]   Many of you at your workplace have the opportunity to participate in a short-term disability
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.780]   insurance program with Aflac or with another company that your company has engaged with.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.880]   Usually these policies cost anywhere from a few dollars to a couple dozen dollars a
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.280]   month, relatively low premiums.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.720]   But the major reason the premiums are so low is because the total maximum benefit is relatively
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.400]   low.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.200]   If you actually consider the cost of insurance, because it's so likely that many people will
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:47.780]   be out of work for a couple of weeks due to a sickness or injury, because that's so likely,
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.400]   the risk of needing it is relatively high.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:58.040]   And so the cost of insurance is relatively high when compared to the actual benefit received
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.680]   because the likelihood of needing it is high.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.140]   I hope this is clear.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.640]   Let me flip it and talk about long-term disability insurance.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.800]   Long-term disability insurance, the potential maximum benefit for most people who are buying
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:15.480]   a long-term policy is generally pretty high.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.520]   If we just simply calculated here the – let's just even skip an inflation benefit.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.600]   Let's just say you have a benefit for $4,000 a month.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.040]   You're a 35-year-old worker and you've got a 30-year benefit period.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.600]   So we can do 4,000 times 12 months a year times 30 years.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.960]   Even if you didn't have an inflation rider on your policy that would allow the benefit
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:49.600]   to go up over time, that would be a total benefit of $1,440,000, $1.4 million.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.440]   So the total maximum benefit available to you, the total maximum value of the policy
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.160]   of $1.4 million is very high, especially as compared to our $9,000 short-term disability
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.740]   policy.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:10.840]   But the likelihood of your collecting on it is relatively low because the likelihood of
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.360]   being disabled for more than three months and being disabled up through – totally
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.840]   disabled for the rest of your career from 35 to 65, that's really low.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.120]   So when you actually look at premiums, the challenge you face is figuring out what's
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.520]   a good financial move and what's not.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.480]   Short-term disability policies will cost you anywhere from a few dollars a month to a couple
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.040]   dozen dollars a month.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.160]   Long-term disability policies will usually be in excess of $100 a month, anywhere from
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.600]   $100 a month to a few hundred dollars a month.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.180]   For some people, it could be up over a thousand or multiple thousands.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.320]   But there we're dealing in the world of $25,000 benefit policies a month.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.180]   We're dealing in the world of high-income professionals.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.920]   So for the most of you, it would be in that middle range of anywhere from under $100 to
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.520]   a couple hundred dollars a month.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:09.600]   So the challenge that you face is that people easily and quickly jump to buying short-term
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.360]   disability almost as a – well, sure, I'll go ahead and take this because they can conceive
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.120]   of being out of work for a month and because it's only a few dollars a month.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.620]   But I consider short-term disability insurance to be very high-priced.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.660]   And people will usually be slow to buy long-term disability insurance policy because it's
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.700]   going to be a couple hundred dollars a month.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:39.320]   But I consider it to be very low-priced when compared to the maximum benefit and when compared
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.760]   to the problem.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.460]   So let's talk about the problem of a short-term disability.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.460]   You're out of work for a month.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.340]   You have no insurance.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.420]   Problem is there, but for most people, it's relatively low.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.820]   You can get through being disabled for a month even if you don't have much money.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.820]   You can put some payments on a credit card.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.320]   You can borrow money from friends or family.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.900]   You can rely on the charity of friends or family.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.860]   You can just simply eat up all the food in your pantry and be late on a few bills and
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.100]   try to catch up in the future.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.900]   Now can that be very difficult?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   Yes.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.100]   I'm not saying it can't be difficult on a household.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.380]   I am saying that compared to the problem of being disabled for five years, it's a minor
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.220]   inconvenience.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:30.420]   So I would much rather people work and prepare for a long-term disability insurance policy
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.060]   – excuse me, for a long-term disability event because that's the catastrophic event
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.860]   versus the short-term.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.380]   In general, I would recommend to people that they buy long-term disability insurance.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.300]   Now should they also buy short-term disability?
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.980]   I think it's worth considering for those people who are living paycheck to paycheck
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.820]   and who don't have an emergency fund of any type, especially in things where – I
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.980]   mean Aflac does huge business.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.780]   Places where people are in the construction industry, places where people are in very
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.260]   basic jobs.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.860]   You're making $13 an hour, making $13 an hour living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.180]   Well, here a short-term disability event can be very difficult.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.820]   To allocate $20 a month towards a disability policy that if you hurt your – break your
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.900]   leg or something and you're out of work for a couple of months will pay out, that
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.340]   could be a very wise move.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.460]   But it probably shouldn't be the first thing.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.300]   And again, you come into this challenge of how much money is actually available.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   Does the person making $26,000 a year earning $13 an hour, can they actually go ahead and
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.660]   allocate $100 a month towards a long-term disability policy?
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.660]   Hard to say.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.660]   So I'm not opposed to either one.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:49.020]   I consider long-term disability to be the more important one for most of you who can
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.900]   save and already have saved a few thousand dollars or a few months of expenses.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.060]   Long-term disability is the major hole.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.060]   And if I were starting off with nothing, I would probably buy a short-term disability
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:06.900]   policy until I got to the point of establishing myself and building up 10 or 15 or $20,000
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.900]   in the bank.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:14.300]   But I just wouldn't plan on that being the major impact.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:20.220]   It's a real tension here because you've got to make a guess on things that are ultimately
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.020]   unknowable.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.260]   If being out of work for a month would sink you, probably go ahead and buy a short-term
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.380]   disability if it's available to you at your job or if it's offered to you as a benefit
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.280]   because you can pretty easily budget the $20.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.100]   But make it a goal to get the long-term disability as quickly as you can, as quickly as you can
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.500]   budget for it and make it happen because that's the truly catastrophic event.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:49.540]   And then make it also a goal to, for the sake of efficiency, self-insure through a short-term
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.060]   disability need.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.460]   So once you have comfortably established yourself, you're building up your reserves, you're building
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.540]   up and you've got 10, 15, $20,000 in your emergency fund, then go ahead and consider
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.860]   dropping the short-term disability.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.520]   Because relatively speaking, the price of the insurance is compared to the benefit,
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.720]   $9,000 and you're paying $30 a month for a $9,000 benefit, that can be a relatively high
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.280]   cost of insurance.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.660]   And a good rule of thumb for running our financial lives is to try to be as efficient as possible.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.000]   You want to insure against the stuff – you want to self-insure against the stuff that
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.400]   you can afford to lose and then you want to insure against the stuff that you can't afford
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.840]   to lose.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   Hopefully sounds a little wishy-washy.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.960]   I don't know how to make it any less wishy-washy.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.680]   That's the best way I know to approach the long-term disability versus short-term disability
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   discussion.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.640]   Let me define for you three different areas of terms.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.120]   I want to talk about benefit periods, elimination periods, and continuance provisions.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.680]   And here we're going to get a little bit technical.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.480]   Benefit period is exactly what I've been talking about and so is elimination period.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.080]   But these are the technical terms that you will decide.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.720]   The benefit period is how long, once you're disabled, do you receive benefits from the
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.560]   disability insurance policy.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.960]   You have different options.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   Like I said, you may have a policy that will pay you out for a month or three months.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.520]   You may have a policy that will pay you out for two years.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.280]   You may have a policy that will pay you out for five years.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.200]   You may have a policy that will pay you out through age 65 or age 70.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   The longer the benefit period, the higher the premium.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.200]   The shorter the benefit period, the lower the premium.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   And the reason for this is because of the total potential benefit from the policy.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   Again, if you're getting a $4,000 a month policy, ignore inflation for a moment.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.980]   Let's say you got a $4,000 a month policy for 60 months, five years.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:56.720]   Your total benefit that you might receive from the policy is $240,000.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.760]   But if you're a 35-year-old worker and you have that same $4,000 a month and you get
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.280]   it until age 65, that's that $1.4 million number.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:13.360]   Big difference in risk for the insurance company between $1.4 million and $240,000, especially
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.520]   when you look at the morbidity tables for disability insurance.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.160]   You'll see that once somebody reaches five years of disability, there's a much higher
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.560]   likelihood that that person is going to be disabled permanently for the rest of their
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.720]   life than that they're going to recover.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.640]   That's different than somebody being disabled for a year.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.520]   A year, you might be out for a year with back injury.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:41.440]   But you might be out for the rest of your life if you break your back.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.560]   So if you're trying to save on premiums, one of the tools that a good insurance agent will
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.680]   do is they'll sometimes shorten up that benefit period.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.760]   I've had to do this many times, sitting down, looking at a budget, young family, stretched
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.760]   finances.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.120]   They know they need disability insurance, but they also need life insurance and they
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.720]   also need to save money and they also need to pay off their debt, etc., etc.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   Well, what do we do?
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.560]   Well, sometimes I would love it if everyone had a policy that would pay them out through
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.360]   age 65 or 70.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.760]   But sometimes you can save substantial amounts of money by shortening that up to five years.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:17.320]   And so I would shorten it up to five years knowing that I've covered most of the disability
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   circumstances.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.760]   The likelihood of being beyond five years is less, but I've covered most circumstances
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   they're going to be in.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.160]   That will save us a lot of money on premiums by shortening it up to five years.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.400]   So I've covered a three-year disability.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.640]   I've covered – and in five years, if they were totally disabled, my theory was I could
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   help them.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.240]   They could figure something out to retrain, use the five years to try to figure out how
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.760]   to get into a different job of some kind.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.160]   But that's the benefit period.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.760]   Just always remember the longer the period, the higher the premium.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.120]   The shorter the period, the lower the premium.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:56.320]   You should go with the longest period possible if you can afford the premiums or you could
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.440]   go with the shortest period necessary.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.800]   If I were a 50-year-old worker, I had a lot of money for retirement, I only needed the
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.760]   five-year premium – well, five-year benefit period, then I would consider it.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.440]   So that's how the benefit periods work.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.000]   And you can choose these.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's a choice.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.640]   If you're an agent or a financial planner, you should look at this as a flexible thing
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.200]   and figure out what's right for the client, especially when we get to some of the other
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   benefits.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.000]   There are ways to work with certain companies.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.200]   There are ways to shorten the benefit period while still having a catastrophe plan for
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   the longer period.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.720]   We'll get to that when we talk about social insurance substitute benefits.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.200]   Next, elimination period.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.760]   The elimination period is kind of like a deductible.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.440]   The elimination period is this.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.520]   How long do you need to be disabled before the policy kicks in and starts paying you
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.600]   money?
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.620]   The key thing here is the shorter the elimination period, the higher the premium.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.960]   The longer the elimination period, the lower the premium.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.720]   This should be intuitive to you now because by recognizing that you're much more likely
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.480]   to be disabled for a month than you are to be disabled for a year, you can recognize
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.240]   that the risk to the insurance company is much less if you have a one-year elimination
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.520]   period versus a one-month elimination period.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.240]   Thus, your insurance will be cheaper.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.040]   When you're looking at the elimination period, you've got to treat this just like you treat
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.320]   a deductible on other types of insurance.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.960]   How much money do you have and how much time can you get through?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.800]   In essence, this is what we do by steering people who are middle-class people, have savings,
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.880]   have reserves, have credit cards or lines of credit available to them.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.960]   This is why we steer them to a three-month elimination period versus steering them to
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.600]   that one-week elimination period because it results in a substantial decrease in cost
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.500]   and they can get through that three months.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.800]   They can handle that as a deductible.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.360]   Most people can get through three months if they have to.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.840]   But this also implies a planning point.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.760]   Many of you are very good savers.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:05.120]   Many of you have significant amounts of capital and reserve that's liquid and easily available.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.680]   Well, in this situation, if you're simply trying to plan for a worst-case scenario,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:15.040]   a catastrophe, you might choose a very long elimination period in order to save premiums.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.420]   You might choose one year or more if you can find a policy but one year is often the maximum.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:26.120]   You might choose a one-year elimination period knowing that this policy will only pay out
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.320]   in the worst-case scenario where you're disabled for more than a year.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:36.840]   But you might be confident knowing that, "Hey, if I am disabled for more than a year, this
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.960]   thing is going to pay out through 65," and that would be something worth considering.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.400]   Now the premium savings here, you will have to ask your agent to run some cost comparisons.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.600]   Generally, I would always just do a three-month period for most people because if you're disabled
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.240]   for three months, most people are going to want to go ahead and start receiving that
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.680]   benefit period.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.960]   But it is an option for you to have a longer elimination period if you just don't like
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.840]   insurance, "I don't want to waste money on insurance.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.300]   I have lots of liquid cash," okay.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.100]   Sign up for a one-year elimination period but have a very long-term policy.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.720]   That way, you've covered the catastrophe of not being able to work for a very long time
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.560]   without buying too much insurance that you're going to be upset about paying the premiums.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.240]   Next, let's talk about what we call continuance provisions.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.620]   So these are fundamental to the way that the insurance policy works and they're a little
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.620]   bit confusing.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.740]   There are two major words that are used.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.080]   One is called non-cancelable and the other is called guaranteed renewable.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   Now you would think – and what this is is what rights does the insurance company have
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:49.160]   to cancel your policy on you or to change the terms of the policy?
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.760]   That's what these provisions are covering.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   You would think that non-cancelable means that the insurance company can't cancel
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.480]   your policy on you and you would think that guaranteed renewable means that the insurance
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.200]   company is guaranteeing that they have to renew the contract for you at the current
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.720]   premium rate.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.280]   You would think that but for whatever reason, you'd be wrong because it's exactly the
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.560]   opposite.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.760]   So what guaranteed renewable means is as long as you pay the premiums for the insurance
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:24.200]   policy, the insurance company cannot take the contract away from you.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.520]   I'm going to repeat that again.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:33.280]   Once you have the insurance, as long as you pay the insurance premiums, the insurance
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:41.120]   company cannot take the policy away from you for any reason.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   Let's talk about how important this is.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:50.840]   First of all, you get the disability insurance policy and then you get a little older.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.960]   You get sick.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.960]   You get hurt.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.640]   You're not disabled.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.360]   But now all of a sudden, you're a higher risk.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.760]   So because the policy is guaranteed renewable, as long as you pay the premiums, the insurance
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.280]   company can't take it away from you.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:12.200]   That's very important and it's an important component of disability insurance policies.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.400]   Almost all – I have to cover myself because there's always some area of the market that
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.280]   I don't know and somebody that accepts.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   But almost all disability insurance policies are guaranteed renewable.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.360]   That's why you got to get them.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.640]   Individual disability insurance policies are guaranteed renewable.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:33.320]   There are some other things that are interesting in the terms of that contract that you should
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.840]   also pay attention to.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.160]   I'll repeat it again.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:43.120]   As long as you pay the insurance premiums, the insurance company cannot take a contract
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.200]   away from you for any reason.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.560]   So one example I've seen many times and I've often told people, if you have a safe
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.240]   office job and you're going to go out and start an entrepreneurial business.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.440]   Well, when you're starting an entrepreneur, as an entrepreneur, you're not going to
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.240]   be making a lot of money in the short term.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.000]   Thus, you won't be able to get insurance coverage.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.600]   So if you're going to start a business, get your disability insurance now because
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.900]   you're not going to be able to get it in the early years of entrepreneurship.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.500]   Get your disability insurance and you'll be covered while you're building your business.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:22.320]   This could also be applicable to some of you who are changing jobs or industries.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.640]   If you have a safe, secure office job, get disability insurance.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.760]   If you change to a job in a different place, a job of a different occupation, as long as
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.200]   you pay the insurance contract, the insurance company can't change the terms on you.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:44.880]   So if I were a middle income office professional, knowing what I know about insurance, I would
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.780]   buy disability insurance.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.600]   Now at the time of application, you can't have any intention of changing jobs.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.840]   Depending on the company, the application will specify that.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.160]   You will sign and affirm that you don't have any intention of changing jobs in the
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.920]   forthcoming period, whether that's 90 days or whether that's two years.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.360]   Just depends on the insurance company.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.400]   You got to read the contract, read the application.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.120]   But if I had the safe, secure office job and I were working, I would get my disability
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   insurance.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.280]   Then if later on, five years later, I decided to go and get a job as a skydiving instructor
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.240]   or I decided to go and get a job on a North Sea fishing boat or I decided to go and get
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:33.080]   a job as a roofing contractor, I would keep and maintain my disability insurance coverage.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.840]   Now under many contracts, the way that they determine disability is it's whatever disability
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.720]   you're doing at the time of – excuse me, whatever work you're doing at the time of
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.280]   disability.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.160]   So under many contracts that I sold in the past when I had an insurance license, I would
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.800]   sell the contract and I would always clarify this for my clients, why it was so important
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.880]   and so valuable.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.640]   Because the way the contract is written, it's whatever job you're doing at the time of
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.320]   disability.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.920]   So you're working a safe office job.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.400]   You get the coverage and then you go and you start a job as a roofing contractor.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.680]   Well if you fall off a roof and if you're disabled from roofing, the job that you're
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.560]   doing at the time of disability, not at the time of application, then under the terms
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.280]   of the contract, you would be covered and you would have benefited from a significant
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.140]   coverage.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.320]   I don't know that a roofer is even able to get disability insurance coverage or you
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   would have been able to benefit from an inefficient – inappropriate pricing model, a pricing
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.640]   model – pricing differential to your benefit because the cost of insurance for somebody
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.120]   who is a skydiving instructor is going to be much, much higher than the cost of insurance
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.440]   for somebody who's sitting in a cubicle.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   So it's very important.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.280]   That's why the contracts are guaranteed renewable.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:58.460]   This can also come into play in a couple of areas where things like travel.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:04.640]   If you anticipate traveling, I had a situation with a client one time.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:12.600]   The husband was in – was a construction office worker.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.040]   He was an office worker for a construction company and the wife was a nurse.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   And in doing their planning, I recommended to them disability insurance.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.160]   Now, he had some group long-term disability insurance in force.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:33.360]   So I recommended to them a supplemental policy for him and then I recommended to the wife
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.320]   a primary individual disability insurance policy.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.400]   Well, in looking at it, they chose to buy the primary disability insurance policy for
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.440]   the wife and then they chose to not buy the supplemental policy for the husband.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:53.400]   Well, a few years later, three or four years later, they decided to leave their careers
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.640]   and move to Africa as missionaries.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.920]   Well, because of the disability insurance contract that I had placed for the wife, that
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.760]   disability insurance contract was good.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.240]   They were going to be doing – she was going to be working as a medical missionary in a
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.040]   very rough country in Africa.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.960]   Well, under the terms of the contract, she would still be covered if she were disabled
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.040]   even though they're living and working full-time in this very difficult country in Africa.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.280]   That was a valuable provision for her because they could pay it under US-American rates.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.000]   They could pay it under the safer conditions and they wouldn't even have been available.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.480]   He was looking into getting disability insurance.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:37.800]   I was able to find him one quote, actually placed it with Lloyds of London and I was
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.680]   able to get him one offer from Lloyds of London.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:46.280]   However, the benefits were so small and the prices were so high that it just simply didn't
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.920]   make financial sense and I recommended to them that they not do it, that they just simply
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:56.480]   face that risk and self-insure or just care for it in another way.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.720]   So they didn't buy that policy.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.920]   But if earlier they had taken my recommendation and my advice to buy the supplemental policy,
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.560]   numbers are unclear but at this point in my memory, maybe it was a couple thousand bucks
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.680]   a month, then they would have been able to maintain that policy even though they had
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:19.320]   moved from the United States working as an office work to working as a medical missionary
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.780]   in a difficult country in Africa.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.120]   So these are some interesting aspects to that guaranteed renewable provision which make
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.840]   it so valuable and this is one of the reasons why I am a strong proponent of helping people
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.360]   get coverage and helping people get individual coverage at an early age.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.840]   At an early age before they face any difficult circumstances.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.960]   In my own family, I've had two family members that have been disabled with carpal tunnel
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.400]   syndrome and it's a common thing.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.200]   Now both of them are doing better now but both of them have resulted in lost work due
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.520]   to not being able to use a computer and had to do crazy things to be able to use a computer
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.640]   due to overuse and repetitive strain injury.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.600]   So these types of things matter and they matter not just when you're working on a ladder every
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.320]   day, they matter when you're sitting in an office.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.400]   Let's go back and talk about non-cancellable.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.840]   If you buy a contract that's non-cancellable, that means that the company does not have
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.400]   any right to change the pricing of the policy.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.800]   If you buy a policy that's only guaranteed renewable, that's not non-cancellable, then
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   the company has the right to change the pricing of the contract on a class basis.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.600]   Meaning they can't zero in on Joshua Sheets and say, "Well, Joshua Sheets, we don't like
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:37.360]   what he's doing and we think that we're going to increase the premium for him because he
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.700]   gained weight or he got sick or he got hurt."
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.920]   But they could look down and say, "Look, all males between the ages of 30 and 40 in Florida
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:51.500]   were experiencing an inappropriate level of risk and so we're going to increase the premiums
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.500]   on all of them."
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.880]   They could do that.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:41:00.140]   And so the only way that I could avoid that is by buying a policy that's non-cancellable.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.640]   Non-cancellable means the premiums are locked in.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:08.800]   However, non-cancellable is going to be higher in premium costs than guaranteed renewable.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.320]   In my work, I sold very few non-cancellable policies.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.880]   Almost all the policies I sold were guaranteed renewable.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.880]   However, that's not a blanket recommendation.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:24.080]   There are industries, for example, physicians, might very seriously want to consider paying
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.720]   the additional money for a non-cancellable contract.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.480]   You might also want to seriously look into the specific insurance company that you've
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:39.240]   chosen to work with and see if you're comfortable with only a guaranteed renewable contract
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.880]   or if you need that additional layer of protection of a non-cancellable contract.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.120]   Finally, conditionally renewable is the last continuance provision.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.320]   Conditionally renewable, many policies will be in effect for up to age 65.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.480]   And you'll see this where they're conditionally renewable through age 70 if you're still working.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.280]   And then at that period of time, the benefits, the terms of the contract will often change.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:07.120]   They'll drop the benefit period to usually two years is the standard thing.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:12.080]   And so those are the things that allow you to make sure that the policy is going to continue
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.080]   in force.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:19.160]   So this is just the basic starting line of giving you some vocabulary of disability insurance.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.920]   I hope these things are interesting.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.400]   I hope that in light of the sales job that I did on the previous episode, you can start
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.840]   to see now a little bit of the flexibility.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:32.200]   I hope also you can just see how, why it's so difficult for people to be able to make
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.800]   blanket recommendations.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.560]   There is no one size fits all in insurance period, but there's especially no one size
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.120]   fits all solution in disability insurance.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.680]   You may safely discount advice when you hear people say, "Oh, only do this."
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.840]   Because as I've pointed out, hopefully you've heard the scenarios where I've indicated why
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.760]   I would buy short-term disability insurance and not long-term disability.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.880]   Why in some situations I would buy long-term disability and not short-term disability.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.120]   Why in some periods at times I would buy a shorter benefit period, a longer benefit period,
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.640]   a shorter elimination period, a longer elimination period, a guaranteed renewable contract, a
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   non-cancellable guaranteed renewable contract.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.880]   All of these things matter and you have to look at your individual situation to be able
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   to make an appropriate decision on the subject.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   So I hope this is useful to you.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.920]   Thank you so much for your great feedback.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.120]   Two things as we go.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.560]   Thank you to those of you who sign up and support the show as a patron.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.240]   Lots of benefits for that for you there.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.800]   Number one, you just simply put money in my pocket, which I thank you sincerely for.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.040]   Pay me some wages for this work that I'm doing and releasing to you freely.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   Thank you for that.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.520]   I wish that many more hundreds of you would do that.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.080]   It's very important that many more of you continue to do that so I can continue to keep
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.720]   my incentives aligned with your incentives.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.920]   I don't have to bring on lots of advertisers and things like that in order to reach my
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.600]   financial goals that will get in the way.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.280]   So radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.

[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.720]   I'm getting a recommendation of this.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   Does this make sense?"
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.560]   I'd be happy to do that type of work.
