[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.360]   What can you take or do to reduce headache?
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.640]   And in order to address this, we're going to start first
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.400]   with the headaches associated with head hits
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.260]   and traumatic brain injury,
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.380]   because it turns out there's a surprising
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.720]   and very useful approach to doing that.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.840]   But this same approach also can help offset
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960]   and treat headache in other conditions as well.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.500]   Meaning not just for headaches
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.740]   caused by traumatic brain injury,
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.840]   but also headaches caused by sudden onset tension headache
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.620]   or migraine headache, or even perhaps,
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.400]   again, perhaps cluster type headaches.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.760]   So the first substance that I'd like to highlight
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.500]   that has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.360]   and or frequency of headaches is creatine.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.620]   Now, creatine, as many of you know,
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.880]   is something that people supplement and take.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.280]   Most often, creatine is discussed
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.760]   in the context of muscle performance,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.960]   not just for people who weight lift,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.120]   but for people who do endurance exercise.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.320]   And it's often been said that five to 10 grams per day
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280]   of creatine monohydrate, depending on how much you weigh,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.720]   five to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.800]   can increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.960]   can bring more water into muscles, can make you stronger,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.640]   can increase power output, and that is all true.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   That is all completely true.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.720]   We discussed this in the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.040]   with Dr. Andy Galpin when he was a guest
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.960]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Series.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   And we discussed this extensively in an upcoming episode
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.440]   from Dr. Andy Galpin in his special six-part guest series
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.000]   where he is a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.440]   but where really he's the one doing
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.900]   the majority of the teaching.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.060]   That series covers everything
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.480]   from strength, hypertrophy, endurance.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.160]   And there's an episode on supplementation
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.760]   where we go deep into the discussion about creatine.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.320]   Now, in that discussion, and again now,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.840]   we highlight the fact that creatine,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.960]   while most often discussed online and in the media
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.400]   as a supplement for sports performance,
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.360]   for the reasons I just mentioned,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840]   actually has far more data behind it.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.800]   That is laboratory studies exploring the role of creatine
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.320]   in the clinical setting.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.240]   So I'd like to highlight a paper from that literature now
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   that will make very clear as to why creatine is interesting
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.680]   and in fact, very effective for treating headache,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.360]   in particular, headache caused by head hits
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.520]   or traumatic brain injury.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.560]   The title of the paper is "Prevention of Traumatic Headache,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.480]   Dizziness, and Fatigue with Creatine Administration."
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   Now, keep in mind, this is a pilot study.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.940]   It was performed in humans.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.700]   So when you hear the words preclinical,
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.560]   that is if you hear there was a preclinical study on blank,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.100]   that means almost always that the study was performed
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.720]   on animal models, mice, rats, primates, et cetera.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.120]   A clinical trial is something that's carried out on humans.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.400]   And a pilot study means that the study was carried out
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.840]   on humans, but on a fairly small cohort,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.560]   a fairly small group or limited number of subjects.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.120]   Nonetheless, if the data are robust,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.320]   as it is in this case of this paper,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.020]   I think it's worth paying attention to.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.860]   So in this study,
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.100]   what they looked at was creatine administration.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.300]   So what they did is they had people ingest
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.940]   a certain amount of creatine, I'll tell you in a moment,
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.840]   in fluid, so it could be taken in water or milk,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.780]   with or without food,
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.920]   doesn't really matter what time of day.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.520]   They had people take creatine.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.840]   Why would they have people take creatine
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   after traumatic brain injury?
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.960]   And in particular for people that are suffering
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.680]   from headache, dizziness, fatigue, et cetera.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.040]   The reason is that neurons, nerve cells,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.680]   rely very heavily on the regulation of calcium
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.520]   in order to generate those action potentials
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.720]   to communicate with one another.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.060]   So it doesn't matter if it's a motor neuron,
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.740]   a sensory neuron, or a modulatory neuron,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.100]   they all generate action potentials
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.320]   or something similar to it.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.860]   And calcium is important for that process.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.820]   Calcium becomes dysregulated after traumatic brain injury
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.320]   in a number of different ways,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.940]   in particular in ways that impact
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.400]   the energy production systems of cells
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.900]   that are related to ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.100]   For those aficionados out there that want to look it up,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.420]   you can simply look up calcium, ATP, and neurons,
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.780]   and you can learn about that cycle.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.200]   Creatine can be stored in muscles as we talked about before,
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.600]   but creatine, and in particular,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.520]   the phosphorylated form of creatine,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   which is the readily available fuel source form of creatine,
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.240]   can also be stored in brain tissue.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.400]   And it is actually quite prominently stored
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.560]   in the forebrain, the area where the real estate
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.280]   of your brain just behind the forehead,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.680]   which is involved in planning and action
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.040]   and understanding context.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.120]   So it's very important for cognition.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.880]   It's important for personality too,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.020]   but it's important for a number of different aspects of life
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.380]   that have to do with making plans,
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.380]   being able to focus very intensely on your work, et cetera,
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.220]   or on anything for that matter,
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.700]   all functions that become heavily disrupted
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.540]   in people who have traumatic brain injury and concussion.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.540]   Creatine's ability to communicate
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.060]   with the calcium and the ATP system
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.420]   was the motivation behind this study.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.860]   That is, the authors hypothesized
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.200]   on the basis of preclinical data in animals
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.460]   that by increasing creatine stores within the brain,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.180]   not just in the muscle, but in particular within the brain,
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.140]   that the availability of creatine would allow
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.620]   for better cognitive function in general.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.820]   Now, they didn't look at cognition
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.980]   specifically in this paper,
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.020]   but they did look at the other aspects,
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.980]   that is the bad stuff associated with TBI.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.380]   And they had people supplement with creatine
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.340]   at a level that is much higher than the typical level
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.180]   that people supplement with creatine
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.960]   simply for sports performance.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   So as I mentioned before, most people,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.060]   if they supplement with creatine for sports performance,
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.460]   they take creatine monohydrate,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.260]   typically five grams per day, sometimes 10 grams per day
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.780]   if they're about 100 kilograms or greater in body weight.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.580]   100 kilograms is approximately 220 pounds.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.880]   So the dosage that was used for supplementing creatine
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.380]   in this study to address the potential impact of creatine
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.980]   on headache, dizziness, and fatigue
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.300]   was quite a bit higher than the dosages used
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.820]   simply for muscle performance.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.780]   In this study, they had people take a dose of 0.4 grams
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.340]   of creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.220]   So for somebody that weighs 100 kilograms or 220 pounds,
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.020]   that would be 40 grams of creatine per day.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.540]   And if someone weighs half that much,
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.060]   they would take 20 grams of creatine per day.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.420]   And they did that over a period of six months.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.020]   And we know that when you take creatine
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.420]   over and over day to day,
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.100]   that there's a buildup of creatine stores
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.580]   both in the muscles and within the brain tissue.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.020]   And what they found as a consequence
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.280]   of this creatine administration was really striking
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.820]   and I think quite exciting.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.820]   They found a very significant decrease
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.560]   in the frequency of headache
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.660]   in people that were supplementing with creatine
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.400]   as opposed to the controls.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.500]   Now, keep in mind that this is a pilot study,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.420]   but the effects are very dramatic.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.740]   They found a very statistically significant decrease
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.660]   in the frequency of headache
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.500]   in people that were taking creatine.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.300]   In fact, if you look at the controls
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.420]   and you see that they're basically getting headache
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.380]   at a frequency of 90% or more after TBI,
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.140]   the reduction in headache frequency
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.140]   is down to about 10 or 12% in the people taking creatine.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.980]   So that's quite a dramatic effect.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.540]   And if you look at the other measures they took,
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.540]   keep in mind, again, this is a pilot study,
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.940]   so a limited number of subjects,
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.620]   but again, the results are very impressive.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.060]   What they found is that
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.340]   the number of people experiencing dizziness
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.900]   was significantly reduced
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.340]   in people supplementing with creatine
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.420]   as was the number of people experiencing fatigue,
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.360]   kind of acute fatigue and chronic fatigue.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.660]   Again, not chronic fatigue syndrome per se,
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.380]   but chronic fatigue, which was in this study
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.540]   defined as a general sense of bodily weakness
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.700]   and even mental weakness.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.060]   Mental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify,
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.460]   but they were very careful to distinguish
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.220]   between cognitive and mental fatigue
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.540]   versus physical and somatic fatigue.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.340]   They acknowledged that both of those occur in TBI
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.300]   or post-TBI, that headache is quite frequent.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.660]   Basically, the takeaway of this study
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.700]   is that for people experiencing headache,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.620]   dizziness, and fatigue due to TBI,
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.460]   and perhaps, and I want to underline perhaps
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.940]   because it hasn't really been explored yet,
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.020]   but perhaps headache, dizziness, and fatigue
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.020]   due to other conditions, symptoms, or causes of headache,
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.300]   creatine monohydrate supplementation might be,
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.140]   again, might be an excellent candidate for people to try.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.960]   Why do we say that?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.340]   Well, first of all,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.860]   creatine monohydrate is relatively inexpensive.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.200]   It's considered safe at the dosages used in this study
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.120]   and certainly for sports performance as well.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.960]   And there are very few other compounds
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.560]   that have been shown to have as significant an impact
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.500]   on headache over the long-term
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.140]   as has creatine monohydrate
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.360]   in these studies of people with TBI.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.860]   It's also important to highlight the fact
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.700]   that many, many people suffer from TBI,
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.700]   as I mentioned earlier,
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.260]   and as now, there are very few treatments for TBI.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.420]   You tend to get the basic advice coming back,
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.180]   and again, I think it's excellent advice.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.580]   You know, get proper amounts of sleep, get exercise,
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.260]   but don't get another traumatic brain injury.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.900]   That's obvious, but you'd be surprised
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.260]   how many people go right back to work because they have to.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.100]   And, you know, we have to be sympathetic to the fact
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.900]   that many people just can't stop working
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.660]   or go on disability.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.340]   So many people have to go back to work.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.980]   That could be sport or it could be other kinds of work
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.700]   where they are then subject to perhaps getting more TBI.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.100]   Maybe they're getting less rest as a consequence and stress.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.620]   Obviously, stress is a confounding issue for TBI,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.680]   but sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition, all of those things,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.140]   proper social connection,
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.860]   are what people are encouraged to do when they have TBI,
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.180]   but there have been very few compounds,
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.780]   in particular, very few over-the-counter compounds
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.220]   that are known to be safe
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.540]   that have shown efficacy in dealing with TBI.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.540]   So I think that while this is a pilot study
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.500]   and we can consider it preliminary,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.260]   I think it's important enough
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.960]   and the effects were dramatic enough
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.380]   that people with headache,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.100]   and in particular people with TBI,
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.820]   ought to consider supplementing with creatine
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.380]   in order to deal with their headaches.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.140]   And of course, I eagerly await other studies
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.300]   exploring the role of this high dosage of creatine,
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.700]   or I should say relatively high dosage
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.140]   of creatine monohydrate for offsetting headache.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.580]   Meanwhile, I think there are a number of people out there
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.160]   suffering from headache
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.180]   who might consider using creatine monohydrate
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.860]   in an exploratory fashion
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.020]   and seeing whether or not it helps offset their headaches.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.060]   Keep in mind, of course,
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.460]   anytime you're going to add or remove anything,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.900]   supplement or otherwise from your treatment,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.820]   your nutrition, et cetera,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.020]   I do suggest that you consult with your physician,
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.860]   in particular, if you have chronic headaches.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.020]   I don't say that to protect me,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.860]   I say that, of course, to protect you.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.540]   (upbeat music)
