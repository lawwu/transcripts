[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance. Today on the podcast, I want to interact with a
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.760]   series of important questions posed to me by a listener who I will call Amy.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   Amy writes in and says, "Hi, Joshua. Thank you for all the work that you do." Been a big fan,
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.560]   gives me some time on her listening and says, "I was listening to a recent episode, number 1016,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.800]   and it really hit me in a stark way." And for context, 1016 was an episode titled
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.480]   "Things Young Men Should Do in 2024," wherein I read basically a tweet thread by a Twitter user
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.440]   and then interacted a little bit with the ideas with specific advice for young men.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.840]   Amy goes on and shares a little bit about her personal family details with me and says,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.040]   "Anyway, I enjoy your values and leadership. I feel like I have no influence because I have no sons
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.040]   and am not a man. When I listen to an episode like this, it makes me question my existence
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   and if I have any power or values as a woman." So, please bear with me in my questions. I ask
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.560]   them from a positive perspective because I'd appreciate your leadership guidance and perspective.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.520]   And she goes on with these questions. First off, "What would Joshua teach his daughter or young
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.680]   women to become great leaders in our society? Can his," meaning Joshua's, "Can his wife be a leader
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   in the family? How? What does that look like, practically speaking? Does Joshua see the value
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.120]   in women outside of the home, working for pay?" Give some examples that I'll interact with.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.840]   "Should there be women-only clubs? Why doesn't this matter?" Give some examples also about
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.640]   negative clubs for men. "What do you do with your listeners who have no ability to benefit from the
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.160]   teachings that are men-focused?" And then says, "What about the young men who damage society in
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.440]   the name of power and vanity? Why glorify them in this podcast episode?" So, Amy, I think these
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.640]   are great questions and I want to interact with them. First, I'll do the easier ones first.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.280]   I'm going to say this clearly and directly, and I worry that it will come across as offensive,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.320]   but just know that that's not the goal. My goal is to be clear.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:46.080]   I don't want you to listen to that podcast episode. It's fine if you do, but it's not my goal that you
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.840]   listen to that podcast episode. Rather, it is my goal that a young man should listen to that
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.920]   podcast episode or somebody who is coaching a young man or advising a young man. There's an
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.120]   enormous problem in speaking in public, and it's quite simply this. You can't control who listens
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.200]   to your words. You can't control even what they do with them, how they're represented or
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.320]   misrepresented. You can't control who listens, though. And that's okay. But what it means is,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.400]   if you want the people that you're trying to impact to listen to your words, the only solution
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.080]   that you have is to speak in a way that will hopefully engage the kind of people that you
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:36.720]   want to interact with what you have to say. I have two enormous concerns. The first,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   and they're both related to young men, and they're related. So first, I observe that right now,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.960]   men, broadly speaking, especially unmarried men, are not doing well. They're not flourishing in
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.320]   our current world. Now, there are other groups that are not doing well. There are other populations of
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.360]   people who are not flourishing. But a group that is not flourishing is young men, young single men,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   not doing well. On many objective metrics, income, wealth building, marriage rates,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.720]   health, it's not going well. Secondly, that's who I have a deep personal burden for.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.760]   I care about young men on a level that is different than I care about other groups of people. I also
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:38.720]   care about young women. I also care about poor people. I also care about refugees. I also care
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.320]   about people who are in prison. I care about lots of people. But I have a distinct personal burden
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.480]   for young men. That is who I care the most about. That is who I want to serve and help the most.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.880]   And so, I've made a conscious choice that if I'm going to serve and care for young men,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.280]   then I'm going to speak to the people that I want to listen. Now, anybody else is welcome to listen.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.920]   You're welcome to listen. I want you to listen. If there's anything I have to say that can be
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:20.640]   useful to you or helpful to you, I want you here. But if I lose you as a listener and I gain a young
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.360]   man as a listener because of the way that I speak and the way that I communicate,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.840]   I'm content with that choice. I would dearly love to be your friend. I would dearly love
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.960]   to interact with you. I enjoy speaking to smart, wonderful mothers, especially mothers of daughters.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.000]   I have four sons and a daughter. I want your daughters to succeed, which is why I'm going
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.120]   to interact and share and answer your questions honestly. But we can't all do everything that
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.680]   we would like. I'll just give one analogy. You might care about saving the whales and stopping
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.880]   climate change and improving your town and fixing politics and all of those things,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.800]   but you can't impact all of them. And one tool of success that I believe is very important that
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   we really focus on is the idea most popularized by Stephen Covey of the difference between our
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.840]   circle of concern and our circle of control. As Covey taught the concept many years ago in
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.560]   Seven Habits for Highly Successful People, we all have a circle of concern, things that we're
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   concerned about. And global warming and politics and war in the Middle East and our children and
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.160]   nasty playground cleanup and the beach cleanup and the plastic in the oceans. And there's thousands
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.000]   of things that we're all concerned about. But we have a much smaller circle of control. And these
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.320]   are things that we can control. These are things that we can influence and that we can affect.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:03.920]   And if we are spending all our time thinking and talking about things that are within our circle
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.560]   of concern, we generally don't make much progress in life. But if we can laser in focus on things
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.480]   that are within our circle of control, on the things that we can affect, over time we can grow
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.840]   that and we can acquire more influence, more authority, more reputation, more power, and we
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.160]   can affect more of those things that are in our circle of concern. But in order to make progress,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.600]   we have to focus on that smaller circle, that circle of control. And so, as an expression of
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.320]   that, I have a deep personal burden for men, for men who are failing in society, who are not – life
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.920]   is not working and the deck feels stacked against them. That's not to diminish the many significant
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.840]   challenges that women face, but it's to say that I am choosing to focus my energy on men,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.160]   because that's where I believe I can have the biggest impact, because I understand them,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.400]   I understand their issues, I understand the challenges, I understand the successes,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:09.920]   I am one, and I know what works and what doesn't work for men. I also believe that is where I have
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:19.120]   leverage. I believe that when men are flourishing and doing well, that has a follow-on effect of
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:28.800]   generally contributing to a stable society where women also flourish. And so, because I believe
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.920]   that there's leverage, if I can encourage young men and encourage men broadly, then I believe that
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:44.560]   I can have leverage and I care about leverage. This does not minimize you as a woman or your
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:52.720]   daughters or your perspective or your very valid and important questions. What it does mean that
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.360]   with my limited time and energy, I want to focus on the change that I want to see in the world.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:07.520]   And I'm going to – since I have a personal burden and care for men specifically, I want to speak to
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:14.960]   men. And so, I have chosen to do that in my style of communication, in my manner of communication.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.360]   And even in that particular episode, I am imagining a young man coming across my podcast title,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.080]   "Thing Young Men Should Do in 2024." And I am specifically choosing language that I hope will
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.760]   break through for a young man and give him a roadmap and talk about his issues and make him feel
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   connected and heard and understood and cared for and give him a little bit of advice.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:46.080]   And I will speak in that episode, I'll speak in a way that I would never speak to you as a woman.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.840]   Just give an example. In that episode, I used a vulgar word and a vulgar expression. I didn't
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.080]   originate it, I was just reading it from the tweet thread, but I also didn't choose to censor it. Why
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:04.640]   not? Well, because sometimes vulgar language can be employed for effect. And it has a certain effect,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.440]   especially in men, if you don't overuse it, but it has a certain emotional effect and an emotional
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.880]   response. I would not speak to you as a woman using vulgar language, ever. I would not speak
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:25.360]   to a young woman with vulgar language. I generally employ almost no vulgar language in my speech,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.920]   neither in public nor in private. But there is a time for vulgar language for effect, and so I
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.040]   chose not to censor the particular vulgar expression that I used in that particular podcast episode.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.200]   But I'm doing it in hopes that I can connect with men, because that's the change that I want
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.320]   to try to contribute to in the world. I've spent years thinking about this problem and I don't know
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.960]   any other way to approach it. When you communicate in public, you can't choose who listens. So you
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.240]   have to try to focus on the people that you want to listen and speak to them, and then allow other
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.160]   people to listen in if they also find the content useful and helpful. I have an audience that is
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:14.240]   predominantly men, much more than 80% male. And that makes me satisfied, not because I wish to
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.360]   exclude women. I don't mind. I'm grateful for any female listeners that I have. I've had great
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.800]   relationships with many female listeners, and I hope that that continues. There's nothing
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.600]   exclusionary about women. There's no way that I wish to exclude women from listening to my podcast.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   But if I were to create content or materials that were targeted towards women, I would repel men.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.680]   Now, I may repel some women, but I think the ratio is different. If I speak to men
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.240]   in a way that is attractive to men, I'm probably going to repel some women,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:01.040]   but not all. But if I speak to women in a way that is primarily attractive to women,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.640]   I'm probably going to repel most men, if that makes sense. So, I don't know whether that's
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.360]   right or wrong. That's a decision that I have made. And so, I just say, first and foremost,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   that you don't need to listen to that. And if it doesn't help you and it doesn't serve you,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.400]   it doesn't encourage you, or it doesn't give you a vision, if it doesn't help in some way,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.200]   then just skip it and go and find something that does give you what you need at this particular
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:32.000]   point in time in your life. I have made a choice in all of my content that I will respect my
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.960]   listener's control over what he listens to. Every listener has a stop button, a skip button,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.480]   a delete button, a subscribe button, and an unsubscribe button. And so, the choice that I
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:52.960]   have made is to do my very best to respect my listeners who want my content and focus on serving
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:59.360]   the people who want to hear my ideas at the risk of many people exercising their natural right to
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.920]   pause, unsubscribe, leave nasty reviews. All of those things are perfectly fine. But if I do that,
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.800]   I may be able to advance my mission of helping people that I feel particularly called and
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.080]   burdened to try to serve in some way. And I don't know any other pathway for me to be able to
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:22.880]   accomplish that. We need to develop the skills of understanding the context for different
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.080]   conversations and interactions. And this will be important even as I talk more in this episode in
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:34.640]   response to some of your specific questions. One challenge of our modern society is that we've
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.080]   lost privacy of interaction. I was thinking about this with light from a comment that I saw
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.840]   regarding the recent speech by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker. I think that's his name,
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.720]   forgive me, I'm not a football guy. And he was speaking, he's a Roman Catholic who was speaking
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.640]   at a Roman Catholic commencement ceremony in a Roman Catholic college. And the speech that he
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.600]   gave was, I thought, I watched about 15 minutes of it. I didn't read the whole thing or watch the
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.400]   whole thing, but I tried to get the nuts, the bits of it. I thought it was a great speech,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:19.520]   a really good and useful speech to articulate some advice that was very useful. But it was
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.120]   extremely offensive to many people, including many women, because he had the temerity to say
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.240]   to a group of Roman Catholic graduates that many of the women there gathered will ultimately find
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.880]   a greater sense of fulfillment and purpose in their calling as mothers as compared to their
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   calling as businesswomen or as career women. So one thing that I observed is there was a day and
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.560]   age in which a Roman Catholic could speak to a group of Roman Catholics and be understood inside
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:57.040]   the context of Roman Catholicism and the Christian religion. Today, you have to know when you're
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   giving a speech that this is going to go on the internet and there are going to be legions of
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.720]   people who don't share any of our culture. And this has really harmed relationships, because
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:13.200]   I can't be confident in any setting that I'm not being recorded, that I'm not being, you know,
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.800]   someone's Apple Watch or other smartwatch is not recording my audio, that someone's not
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.080]   surreptitiously recording video of me. I just assume everything I say ever is always going to
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.680]   be on the internet. I assume every message that I'm going to write is going to be screenshotted
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.840]   and posted. And what's particularly galling to me is when you see this in the context of family
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:39.120]   relationships, you see children that post their message threads with their parents on the internet
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.360]   or people who fight with their parents in public on social media. It's horrific.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:52.640]   And it's not all bad. Certainly, we've exposed abuse or terrible ideologies and different things
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.960]   and hidden cameras and whistleblowers and all that. It probably has its place. It's not all bad,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:03.280]   but it has changed how we speak. I can't control that. But what I do think is we always need to
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.240]   understand the context of where and how we're going to speak. Even as I interact with your
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.000]   questions that you've asked me, I'm answering these questions in public wildly differently
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.840]   than I would if we were having an individual conversation, not in terms of my perspective,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.160]   but in terms of the application. Because in individual conversation, I would always need
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   to understand who you are, what you think, what your perspective is, what your background is,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.600]   and then filter what I have to say through the light of that, pointing out any commonality or
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   distinctions between those things. And yet in public, I'm not doing that. So keep those things
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.840]   in mind as we discuss these particular issues that you have said, that I'm sorry that what I
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.760]   have to say doesn't resonate with you, but that's a price that I'm willing to pay if I have the hope
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:02.800]   of resonating with men. I want to make one more comment also that needs to be said just because
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.880]   what you said was so pointed and so vulnerable. You wrote in your email, you said, "I feel like
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.040]   I have no influence because I have no sons and I'm not a man. When I listen to an episode like
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   this, it makes me question my existence and if I have any power or value as a woman." I would like
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:35.120]   to as vigorously as possible encourage you that it doesn't matter how you feel, that may be a true
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:44.480]   description of your feelings, and those are your feelings. But what those feelings are implying to
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.600]   you is absolutely, unequivocally false. And therefore, you should reject those feelings
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:58.320]   vigorously, constantly, in every way, shape, and form as absolute lies.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:09.200]   You do have influence. It doesn't matter that you have no sons. It matters that you are a woman,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.800]   and you do have influence because you are a woman. You must never question your existence,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:27.920]   nor should you try to judge any power or value that you have in comparison with the power or
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:37.280]   value of any other person, be it male or female. You are a human being created in the image of God,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:49.200]   worthy of all respect that is associated with your being. You are a mother to daughters. You are a
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.400]   wife. You have undoubtedly many other roles in society. You are a daughter. You probably have
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:04.560]   a job. You have a business. You are a neighbor. You have many roles in society. And we will always
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:11.600]   accord you the respect that you deserve because these things are true. So, ignore your feelings,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.520]   focus on what is true, what you know to be true, what everyone around you knows to be true,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.800]   and then in time, your feelings will adapt to that truth.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.960]   Feelings are useful ephemeral indicators of something happening, in the same way that pain
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   in the body is a useful indicator of a problem in the body. But feelings are not reliable
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:49.040]   decision-making criteria any more than pain is in and of itself a reliable criteria of whether
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:55.440]   you are doing the right thing. You may be exercising, for example, and experiencing pain
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:02.400]   during your exercise. In one context, the pain can be an indication that you're exercising in
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.800]   a dangerous way and you should immediately stop. In another context, the pain that you're
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.560]   experiencing during your exercise may be the indication that your physical therapist who is
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:22.080]   helping you is pointing to you to indicate that what you're doing is working because it's stretching
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:29.760]   the muscle and it's solving the fundamental problem. Similarly, feelings or emotions can be
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:40.160]   useful flags of a real problem in a relationship or in society or in a policy or in a concept or
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   in a thinking. Or they could be the exact opposite. They could be indications that something is wrong
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:54.080]   but it's being fixed and you're experiencing bad feelings because of it. So ignore your feelings
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.080]   and focus on what is true and what is right and what you know to be true and right and let your
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:08.720]   feelings adapt to that rather than drawing from your feelings a primary indication of the
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:15.360]   truthfulness of what you're considering. Now even as I say that, I find it ironic that I am using a
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:21.600]   very masculine style of communication. I'm trying to be as concise as possible but if I were
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:29.680]   together with you in person talking or interacting in some way then I would be very conscious of the
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.840]   fact that I'm speaking to a woman. I would spend significant time listening, probing,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:42.800]   identifying, affirming and then I would try to deliver what I think is true. Those are all things
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.040]   that I would not do if I were speaking to a man. If I were speaking to a man I wouldn't be making
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.640]   this ironic disclaimer at the moment. But this indicates actually how important what I have to
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.120]   say is on the fact that we need to think about the questions that we have and we need to think
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.000]   about what we're doing, how we're training men, how we're training women, how hard it is and how
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   easy it is for them to work together and what's good about it. So I think for example in that
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.320]   podcast episode one of the things that I said that's probably the most potentially offensive
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:18.240]   would be that men should look for a masculine environment to work in. One of the reasons that
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:25.360]   really works well is because as a man who interacts with both men and women you spend all your time,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.440]   if you're a thoughtful, intelligent, emotionally intelligent, you're empathetic, you understand,
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   you spend all your time tying yourself into knots thinking about how do I communicate in such a way
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.400]   that's going to be appropriate to this. And you don't realize it until you go through a good
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.000]   number of years of experience and all of a sudden you realize that's enormously draining to have to
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.160]   think about that. And so when men are in a masculine environment and they're not thinking
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.680]   about how their actions are going to be perceived by women or how their words are going to be
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.480]   perceived by women, it's enormously freeing. It frees their mental bandwidth. They can get more
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.040]   work done faster with fewer concerns because they're not thinking about the feelings of women.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.000]   They're just moving through life and doing the thing. And if you'll talk to men and listen to
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.400]   men, you'll understand that. That's one of the reasons why there's value in sex-segregated
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.040]   societies, cultures, things like that. Now, I'm not arguing that our entire culture should be
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.480]   sex-segregated. I'm not in any way arguing that you or any other woman should be locked in her
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.600]   house wearing a burka and never come out and never interact. I think that's a recipe for disaster,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:37.120]   obviously. But we've lost sight of that and this is one of many reasons men are on the defense
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:46.400]   right now because after years and years and years and years of this sex integration in society of
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:57.040]   men and women coming together, many people can see how it harms and it impacts negatively many
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.800]   aspects of life, including relationships, including productivity, including all of that.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.920]   I don't know what the solution is for many of these things. I don't know. But at least we can
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.760]   start by talking about the problems and then identifying potential solutions. Let's dig into
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.520]   some of your specific questions, though, because I thought these questions were wonderful, useful
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.880]   questions, and I want to answer them directly to you. The first question you ask is this,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:39.280]   "What would Joshua teach his daughter/young women to become great leaders in our society?"
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:46.640]   I'm going to do my best to answer these questions in a concise manner, and so I want to make three
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:54.320]   comments in response to this question specifically. Number one, "What would Joshua teach his daughter
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:01.920]   or young women to become great leaders?" I would teach them that leadership is not the aspiration,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:13.760]   nor is it the goal. Leadership should not be our aspiration or our goal.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:27.120]   Rather, service is the aspiration, and service is the goal. Or we could insert different words here.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:35.520]   Change is the aspiration, and change is the goal. And leadership is a necessary means
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:43.440]   to accomplish this goal. That's not just the sound of that first sip of morning joe.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.280]   It's the sound of someone shopping for a car on Carvana from the comfort of home.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.480]   That's a good blend.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.040]   It's time to take it easy, like answering some easy questions to get pre-qualified for a car
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.920]   in minutes.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.600]   Talk about starting the morning right.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.320]   Just like customizing your terms so your car fits your budget.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:05.120]   Visit Carvana.com or download the app to experience car shopping the way it should be,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.480]   convenient, comfortable.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.480]   Specifically, what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to counteract the idea that
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.920]   leadership is something that we should pursue for its own sake.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.400]   And the reason I'm saying that is many people, when they think of leadership,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.880]   they automatically substitute power for leadership.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.240]   They try to get power over other people.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.280]   They try to get authority over other people.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   And that often can lead to abuse of other people, subjugation of other people.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.800]   I don't believe that leadership is a bad thing in any way.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:56.000]   But I think it's a very fickle ambition specifically, and shouldn't be the primary
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.720]   aspiration or ambition that any man or woman has.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:06.880]   On the contrary, I think that service is a more noble and cleaner way or cleaner
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.720]   thing to aspire to.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:15.680]   And then we recognize that in order to render service or in order to affect
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:23.280]   positive change in whatever the domain of our service, leadership is necessary
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.600]   in order to accomplish those goals.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.400]   The second way that I would answer this question, specifically the question that
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.600]   what would Joshua teach his daughter or young women to become great leaders in
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.680]   society, is that we need to teach skills.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.640]   You need to actually have and develop skills.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.080]   Leadership, for example, is not a skill in and of itself.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.680]   It's a skill that is true, but is expressed in a specific domain.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:01.600]   For example, you don't take a leader who is skilled at leading a sports team.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.320]   Let's say you're interacting with a young woman who is the captain of her volleyball
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.120]   team, and she's been the captain of her volleyball team for four years.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:17.520]   You don't take her as the captain of her volleyball team and then put her on a
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.160]   wildland firefighting team and say, "Because you were the captain of your wildland
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.520]   firefighting team, you're now automatically the captain of your wildland
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.320]   firefighting team."
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.120]   So, leadership can't be talked about exclusively in the context of a specific
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   domain without other skills.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.800]   Leadership requires the development of actual skills.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.840]   Now, leadership is something that does transfer across domains.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.800]   You may develop leadership skills and qualities in the context of a sports team,
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.360]   and then you may find yourself later on a business team expressing those skills
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.400]   in a context and see the relation of them.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.920]   But you need to learn actual skills while you're learning and demonstrating
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.480]   leadership.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.280]   So, if you're going to become a great leader, you need to know something.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.800]   You need to do something.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.880]   You need to develop skills.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.760]   You need to cultivate your abilities.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   You need to cultivate your talents and hone them to a high degree.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:25.200]   And then when you are interacting in a group context, you want to cultivate your
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.960]   skills of leadership because sometimes they're transferable.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.440]   But you don't set a goal to just be a leader.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.200]   Rather, you develop leadership skills in a specific context.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:42.160]   The third thing I would say is leadership is not the definition of success.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:48.320]   If by leadership you are associating that with power, then it's understandable how
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.440]   someone who is pursuing power over other people to be able to manipulate them or
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.680]   subjugate them, why that person would say that the only way I'll be successful is
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.600]   if I'm a leader.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.960]   But I do not see leadership as the definition of success.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:09.840]   If the only way to be successful is to be the leader or a leader, but I'm going to
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.680]   say the leader to make this point, if the only way to be successful is to be the
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.560]   leader, then by definition, only a small number of people can be successful.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:26.960]   Rather, I see leadership as something that we do in various contexts and in various
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.640]   ways, and yet that's not a fundamental expression of our success or not success.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.240]   I'll just give a personal example.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.560]   I, Joshua Sheets, I have developed certain skills and attributes and abilities over
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.680]   the years that helped me to exercise leadership.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.960]   Some of them are natural and innate.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.840]   I'm a man.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.440]   I'm physically large.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.400]   I can speak with a loud voice when desired.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.360]   These are basic innate attributes that I have no, I didn't do anything, but they make
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.000]   it easier.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.680]   I have an easier time than people who are small or short.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.880]   I have an easier time being a man than being a woman.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.560]   I have an easier time because I can speak in a loud voice as compared to being
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.680]   physically handicapped in some way or not being able to speak in a loud voice.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:18.160]   I have other basic attributes that make it easier for me to exercise leadership.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.480]   I am a father of a family.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   I've built enormous self-confidence.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.000]   I have a good reputation, generally with those around.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.280]   I'm not a swindler.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.960]   I speak well of other people.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.080]   I'm not a gossip.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.840]   I just generally have a good reputation among people, not perfect.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.280]   I'm not trying to say anything wrong, but I just, I generally live on the whole a moral
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.840]   and virtuous and righteous life.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.800]   I don't have anything.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.280]   I don't have any skeletons hidden in my closet.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.240]   So I'm generally well thought of by most people.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:58.480]   I also have certain attributes in my normal life that make it so that I can exercise leadership.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.600]   I have deep levels of knowledge in various domains that I've taken an interest in.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.560]   I have formal certifications and credentials that help me to demonstrate that I am worthy
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.440]   of that respect because other credentialing bodies have demonstrated that I've done the
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.680]   work.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   I have a platform with a podcast and successful business and those kinds of things.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:28.960]   So it's relatively easy for me to go around and exercise leadership.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.200]   It wasn't always easy.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.560]   I've worked for decades and practiced doing the hard things, stepping up, saying something
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.920]   when it was uncomfortable.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.320]   And so I'm getting better, but I feel like in many ways I'm coming into the prime of
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.600]   my life where I'm arriving at a stage in life where as a man, other people, you've worked
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.320]   really hard to build things that are worthy of respect and other people give you levels
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.200]   of that respect.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.280]   So then the question is this, is my goal to go around and to constantly be the dominant
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.920]   leader wherever I go?
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.360]   My answer is a resounding no.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:19.200]   Because I know that I am a leader, I specifically try to be slow to speak.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.880]   I specifically try to be the one who prefers others.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.600]   I specifically try to encourage anyone who is younger or more timid.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.920]   I specifically try to always get other people to go first.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.640]   If I'm in a meeting of some kind, I don't want to be the guy who talks very much.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.040]   I don't want to be the guy who goes on and on.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.880]   On the contrary, I want to be the guy who lifts other people up.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:53.040]   Because as I see it, the proper goal of a leader is to lose his leadership because it's
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.240]   not needed anymore.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:00.000]   I first heard that phrase when I was a child from a Christian minister who very clearly
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.760]   articulated that the goal of a Christian preacher or a Christian minister should be, is, properly
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:16.800]   is to lose his ministry, that I should judge my effect as a Christian preacher or a Christian
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.560]   minister based upon how effectively I have raised others up to take my place.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:31.840]   And so similarly, I as a father, my goal as a father is to lose my job as a father.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.320]   Now, I'll always be a father because that's a role of definition, not a function.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.480]   But in terms of function, I want to raise my children up to maturity.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.680]   I want them to take over all of the functions that I'm currently doing so that I can sit
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.960]   back and relax.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.080]   And I would say that this is similar to, I would point to my own parents as a natural
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.200]   example of this.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.120]   My father and mother are in their 80s.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.720]   And when we gather together as a family with them and their many children and their many
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.960]   grandchildren, they have no need to exercise leadership.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:10.080]   And in fact, they consciously choose not to exercise leadership because that's no longer
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.800]   their primary function on a day-to-day basis, that their success as parents is proven by
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.880]   the fact that we, as their children, invite them to come to an event, we arrange all the
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.160]   details, and they don't have to be the father and mother doing all those things.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.400]   It's their children now who are doing them.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   And the children plan the event, plan the – do the work, and the parents get to sit
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.440]   and relax.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.320]   And yet, ultimately, they're the ultimate leaders.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   And so leadership is not something to be aspired to as a positional thing, that my goal is
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.400]   to be a leader.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.280]   And once I'm a leader, then I'm always going to be the leader.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.360]   On the contrary, leadership is a function that we take on in various contexts, and we
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.080]   do it so that we can raise other people up.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.760]   And the goal of a leader should be whenever leadership is necessary, we step in and we
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.200]   exercise leadership for the common good, for the good of the group that we are giving leadership
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.720]   to, and then we step back as appropriate, and hopefully, in the context, we raise up
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.320]   other leaders among us.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.000]   That's the goal of leadership.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.480]   So those would be my answers to your first question.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.000]   Your question was, "What would Joshua teach his daughter or young women to become great
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.520]   leaders in our society?"
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.480]   I would teach them, number one, that leadership is not an aspiration, or not a suitable aspiration
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.360]   or goal, services or effectiveness is, and leadership is a necessary means to accomplish
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.000]   those goals.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.240]   Number two is I would teach young women that in order to exercise leadership, you have
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:49.120]   to develop skills and virtues and knowledge and ability with the skills of leadership
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   simultaneously.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.360]   You need both of those things.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.120]   It's not that we just pursue leadership, but we'd have to genuinely be useful and
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.840]   then develop the skills of leadership, which can move from domain to domain.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.600]   Number three, I would say that leadership is not a definition of success.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.520]   If it were, then only a small number of people in society could be successful.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.680]   There are other elements of success and that leadership is a function that you provide
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:23.040]   and that you give in various contexts with the goal of raising other people up, and it
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.840]   usually comes with an enormous cost.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.360]   So the more that you give leadership, I think the natural experience of giving leadership
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.440]   is that the more that you give leadership, the less you want to give leadership, because
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.200]   it comes with an enormous cost.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.600]   As a leader, you are responsible.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.280]   All of the arrows go into you.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.800]   All of the hurt comes from you.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.960]   All of the attacks come against you.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.080]   And so you better be ready to bear that cost if you're going to exercise leadership.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:58.800]   And it's not something that should be done flippantly or somehow this is something that
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.760]   I want.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:05.280]   The older I get, the happier I am not to be the leader because I understand the price
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.080]   that comes with leadership, but I understand that it's a necessary duty that I must
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.240]   perform in order to have service to the group.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.440]   The next question that you asked me, can, I'm just going to say Joshua's wife, because
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.600]   you wrote his wife, can Joshua's wife be a leader in the family?
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:23.920]   How?
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.760]   What does that look like practically speaking?
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.240]   So my answer to that is can she?
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.000]   Absolutely.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.920]   And I would say far beyond can is that she better be a leader in the family.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.600]   My wife is a mother.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.520]   And that means that if she's not leading in the family, we've got chaos.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.040]   We've got absolute chaos.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.440]   I need my wife to be a strong and capable and dynamic leader.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.360]   I need her to be the absolute ruler of her home.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:59.840]   And depending on the dimension or what we're involved in, there are going to be many, many
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.960]   areas beyond that.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.920]   My wife is the matriarch of our family.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.960]   If she doesn't exercise leadership, we're sunk.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.640]   She has to exercise continual leadership.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.960]   Now for her privacy, I'm not going to give any specific details of what she does.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.320]   I'm going to speak generally and simply say that in general, can a wife be a leader in
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:22.960]   the family?
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.200]   How?
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.600]   What does that look like practically speaking?
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.920]   She had better be a leader in the family.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.200]   She had better be involved with every aspect of the family.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   Every family is going to be different, but she may have children, in which case she has
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.280]   enormous amounts of work and leadership there.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.880]   She needs to run a household.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.760]   In some cases, she's going to be managing the family budget, managing the family's
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.560]   investments, managing the care of the household, keeping the house running and functioning
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.080]   really beautifully and making sure that all the workmen are doing their job.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.440]   She may be out fixing stuff and changing things.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.040]   She's got enormous work there.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.320]   Some people have businesses.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.480]   And so she might be running a business that's involved with the family.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.120]   She might have a job where she has to exercise leadership.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.640]   There may be many, many components where she exercises leadership.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.920]   The fact that she is a woman does not in any way absolve her of the burden of leadership
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.520]   in an appropriate domain.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.880]   And if she didn't have those characteristics, it's hard to believe that she'd be a wife
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.440]   and mother.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.240]   What man would want to marry a woman who's weak and who's incompetent and who doesn't
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.280]   know how to exercise leadership and strength and do things?
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.560]   I need to be careful with my words.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.600]   I don't want to cite anybody specifically because I know that there are men out there
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.960]   who say that they want that.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:45.200]   I listen to men in the red pill space and some of their leaders in that space.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:52.080]   And when they talk about women, it just sounds like an absolute farce.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.560]   It sounds it's like they want a girlfriend who's not involved in anything that they're
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.040]   doing and they expect somehow to have six of them.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.000]   And the women, their only job is to sit around and look pretty and bear babies.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.440]   That seems to be the extent of their vision that they express for their relationships.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.880]   Now, I don't know if it's actually working for them, but I think that's stupid.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.320]   I would never encourage a man to look for a woman like that.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.760]   And a woman, I can't imagine also a woman who is strong and who is capable ever accepting
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.120]   a man who treated her like that.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.320]   So they probably deserve each other.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.560]   The women seem to accept what they're doing and the men accept those kind of women.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.440]   But I don't think that's a formula for a strong family.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:42.560]   So we're looking, a man who wants a wife is not looking for a burden.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.880]   He's looking for a partner and he's looking for a strong and confident and capable wife
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.960]   who is going to be by his side through everything.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.480]   And every family is going to be different, right?
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.880]   If a guy's got a job and he's got a 40-hour a week job that he goes to and his wife has
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:08.080]   10 small babies, then she's going to be super hyper domestic and focused on babies because
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.680]   how is she going to do anything more?
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   And he's going to be doing everything at the job.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.000]   They're going to have a very different expression of leadership than if they run a business
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.800]   together and their business partners and their children are all grown, they're going to have
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.320]   a very different expression.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:29.120]   And so my point is that leadership is not optional for a wife in any way, shape or form.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:36.320]   I think probably what you're listening for is for some kind of disclaimer to say, well,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.480]   is Joshua's wife his leader or is Joshua's wife the leader of the family?
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.000]   That's probably what you're trying to listen for and what people get kind of all up in
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.560]   arms about.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.000]   What I would say is that, no, my wife is not my leader.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:52.960]   I am her leader.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.920]   I'm her head.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.120]   We are married.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.240]   We are man and wife.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.040]   And so if there has to be ultimate authority or ultimate leadership, it's on me.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.840]   If there has to be ultimate blame, it's on me.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.920]   I am responsible for all of it.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.880]   I'm responsible for her and her leadership.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.560]   And in the same way that if I am the CEO of a company, I'm responsible for all of it.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.920]   Whether I'm actually culpable and I did it or not doesn't matter.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.880]   It all rests on my shoulders and I have to fix it.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:27.200]   So that doesn't, however, in any way absolve her of her burden for leadership.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.560]   And as a husband, one of my primary jobs and one of my primary duties and responsibilities
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:39.600]   as a leader is to help her to develop her leadership so that she can express her gifts
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.080]   in the world.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.560]   And that is my job and my responsibility.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.280]   So I'm not going to go deeply into that because it gets much more personal and it's
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.880]   difficult for any person.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.120]   But women are not absolved of the burden of leadership.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:59.360]   And there will be many different times in a family's environment where she will have
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.960]   to exercise more leadership, less leadership, and her goal should be to be raising leaders.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.480]   Her sons and daughters need to be being raised up to be leaders.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.160]   That's what leadership does.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.960]   Now let's go on to the next question and keep this one in mind because I'm going to
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.480]   bring in some more points for the next question.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.040]   Next question.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:22.560]   Does Joshua see the value in women outside of the home working for pay?
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.440]   First, I would say that the way that the question is asked is certainly sincere.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.920]   And I'm not judging you for just writing down a question.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.960]   What I'm saying is, however, is that I think this is a strange, a very strange question
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:45.520]   that indicates that you're not interacting with real people, but you're interacting
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.440]   with a straw man and caricature.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.320]   Does Joshua see the value in women outside of the home?
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.760]   Of course, Joshua sees the value in women outside of the home.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.760]   I'm not, again, I'm not a Muslim.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.520]   I'm not saying that women should wear a burqa and be sitting at home.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.840]   I think that's a terrible plan for society.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.720]   Women are incredibly valuable outside of the home.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.640]   And should women be working for pay?
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.880]   Of course, women should be working for pay.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.480]   Women have always worked for pay.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.120]   What would we do?
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.480]   Let's say I died today.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.200]   What's my wife going to do?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.320]   Is she going to sit around in the home and somehow say that, well, here I am sitting
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.480]   in the home and I can't go out and work for pay?
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   Now, if I've done a good job as a man, she should never have to go and work for pay.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.000]   That's one of my goals, especially since we invented life insurance, is I hope that she
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.520]   would never have to do that.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.760]   But imagine if I didn't have life insurance.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.360]   Or imagine I have a daughter.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.920]   Since when does my daughter get to be absolved of the need to support herself?
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.120]   Now, as her father, if I can support her, I want to support her.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.160]   And I'm going to treat my daughters differently than I treat my sons.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.640]   But the point remains that she's not absolved of work and working outside the home just
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   because she's a woman, nor is she absolved of the need to work for pay.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:10.720]   I'm not aware of any society anywhere in the world in which women have ever been freed
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.680]   from the need to work or to work outside of the home.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.440]   Let's go back to some of the oldest texts in recorded history.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.560]   Go to Abraham and how he found a wife for his son Isaac.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   So Abraham, probably a little under 4,000 years ago, maybe 3,900, 3,800 years ago at
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.880]   this point, something like that, that Abraham was living.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.200]   And he wanted to find a wife for his son Isaac.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   So he sends his servant from where he was living back to the land of his people.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:43.840]   And the servant prays to God and says, "God, show me the woman or a woman who is appropriate
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.240]   for me to bring back for Isaac, my master, as his wife."
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.440]   Well, what does he find?
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   He goes to the well of the town and here come the young maidens to draw water and that's
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.880]   where he meets Rebecca.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.120]   She's going to draw water and bring water from the well for her family.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.400]   So here she is working outside of the home.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.960]   Rachel and Leah, they were shepherdesses with Jacob later.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.360]   And so you go throughout all of human history and women have always had to work and they
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.360]   have always had to work outside of the home.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.160]   In many cases, serving again as a shepherdess or some similar function.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.520]   Now, in an agrarian society, why do we get the concept of working in the home?
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   In the agrarian society, we can see very clearly that there are certain functions and jobs
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.880]   that men can do because of their physical stature and size.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.520]   And there are other functions and jobs that women can do because of their physical stature
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.960]   and size and abilities.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.120]   There's years ago, I used to read this personal finance blog.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.520]   I forgot the name of it, but there was a couple that moved to the northeast and they bought
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.920]   a farm and they were fire people, early retirement people, and they moved out to this farm and
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.240]   they were progressive liberals who had moved to this farm to have a couple of children,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.320]   I think in Vermont, and have babies.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.480]   And I read an article that the lady wrote and she talked about how frustrated she was
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.320]   that they were progressive liberals who very much believed in gender equality.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.000]   And yet they were frustrated that on the farm, they found themselves falling into gender
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.400]   stereotypical roles on the farm, that she did the cooking and the cleaning and the husband
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   was doing all of the outdoors farm work.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.160]   So I'd say this is obvious and understandable in an agrarian context.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.480]   I think one of the keys though that I would point to is that throughout history, most
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.560]   family businesses and most work has been family integrated in some way.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.920]   There's always been household productivity in some way.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.520]   There's always been kind of, again, a household business of some kind.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.120]   So you have one context in an agrarian context of what that looks like.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.880]   You have a different context in a family business or a merchant, but there's lots and lots of
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.160]   business and women are not absolved of that work outside the home.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.600]   It's not like just because you're a woman, you get to sit at home and do nothing but
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   cook and clean the house.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.240]   I think that it's nice if women can do that.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:05.040]   There aren't many things easier and more relaxing than sitting in a house and cooking and cleaning.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.200]   It's pretty simple, straightforward, easy work, but I don't think you get that pass.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   You don't get to just do that unless you're fortunate to be married to a rich man.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:20.800]   Families and couples, families are economic units and there has to be a benefit to the
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.960]   economic unit of each spouse's labor.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.080]   Otherwise, there is a real challenge and there's a real problem.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:34.240]   Now, throughout history, men have, especially rich men, have appreciated certain things
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:39.920]   that women can bring into their life that don't resemble hard labor and so different
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.440]   cultures have a different expression of this.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.320]   But if you find a rich man, it makes him happy a lot of times that his wife doesn't have
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   to do hard labor.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:53.120]   I take a great deal of joy and satisfaction in the idea that my wife doesn't have to go
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.000]   and work for wages and work somewhere else.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.680]   But in some cases, there may not be another possibility.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.400]   She might have to and this should be obvious.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.160]   Again, I say, what if I died?
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.080]   What if my wife never married?
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:11.760]   If she just – think about these things and don't just assume that somehow women get
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.440]   to escape from work because they're women.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.480]   It's not the case.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.800]   They have to work because they're women.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.400]   The work looks differently.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.280]   Now, let's turn more pointedly to the issue at hand.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.240]   If Joshua is talking about the problems with dual-income families, what's the problem?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.960]   Well, at its core, one problem is that the lifestyle just doesn't seem to be sustainable.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.840]   And I mean that in the most literal sense possible.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:44.080]   If you look at human reproduction statistics right now, if you were a biologist studying
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:51.760]   the human species, you would be writing reports day and night about this species going extinct
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.600]   or at least subgroups of this species going extinct.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:06.800]   The data on societies that are built around men and women having jobs and each of them
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:14.160]   having his or her own career and that being the primary organizing principle of the society,
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:19.360]   these societies are going extinct in just a few generations.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:26.640]   It is entirely unsustainable in the most literal sense that I can possibly say it.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:35.120]   Every society that has structured around the idea that men and women should each have jobs
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:42.000]   and careers and that the primary organizing principle of their lives should be them earning
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.280]   money for their own gratification, these cultures will not exist a century or two from now.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.680]   They are unsustainable.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:57.600]   They're very strong in the moment, but they're a very recent phenomenon and they will go
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:03.040]   extinct within a couple of generations because they're not having any babies.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:11.840]   Throughout human history, the continuance of the family and of the community and of
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.320]   the culture was always a primary focus.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.800]   Now, there are times and it's expressed in different ways.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.280]   Throughout most of human history, there's been so much work that you could barely get
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.640]   subsistence living on it.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.720]   Nobody thought about self-fulfillment and self-gratification and self-actualization
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.280]   through my work.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.160]   You work to live.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.720]   You work to eat, to literally stay alive.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.800]   Throughout most of human history, you had babies because you wanted to have sex.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.080]   And if you could find someone to have sex with, then you had babies.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.840]   Today, well, we think that we're masters of our own reproduction and that we should
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.360]   choose exactly when each and one of our every babies comes along.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:53.280]   So, my point is that this society is quite literally unsustainable.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.800]   Quite literally, every group that doesn't find a solution will disappear from the world
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.320]   in a couple of generations.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:06.400]   If you think I'm being hyperbolic, it's because you've not done the math.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:11.120]   I am not employing hyperbole here in this context.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.360]   So, the question is, let's flip it on its face.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:20.000]   Instead of asking me, "Do I see value in women outside of the home working for pay?"
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:28.640]   I am asking you, "Do you see value of women in the home not working for pay?"
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.040]   That's the point I'm trying to make.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:38.160]   I saw this made the other day in a quite eloquent thread from a Twitter post from
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.880]   one of my favorite authors, Anthony Esalen.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.520]   Here is his tweet verbatim.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:51.040]   It was in the context of the Harrison Butker furor this last week.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:57.280]   "By far the most accomplished woman I know personally, whose name I won't reveal because
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.320]   I don't want to cause her trouble, recommended that I read Mr. Butker's commencement speech.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.080]   She said it was spectacular.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.320]   This was before I told her that I'd written about it.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.160]   There are a few things in play that nobody has talked about.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.600]   Here's one.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.360]   Jesus says that we must become like little children, or we will not enter the kingdom
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:19.920]   of heaven.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.760]   Now, we are not overtly cruel to children.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.680]   Boys aren't going down into the coal mines and girls aren't going into the sweatshops.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.200]   But I'd prefer the life of a child in the New York slums that Jacob Rees described
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.640]   in the 1890s, and he was closely attentive to what the slum children did for a play,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.600]   did for play, in all seasons, than the life of a typical American child now.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:50.240]   If children are to be outdoors playing, building things, visiting each other's houses,
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.000]   roaming the town or the woods, there must be people at home.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.360]   You cannot have that life if the neighborhood is empty during the hours between breakfast
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:54:59.920]   and supper.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.000]   And what about small children?
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.240]   If no one is at home, they must be taken care of in an institutional way by people
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.040]   who may like them, but who do not love them, and who have no strong connection to their
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.400]   parents, their relatives, or their neighbors, if any connection at all.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:22.000]   I look back upon my childhood, less bound by the need to earn money than my father's
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.040]   childhood was, but also a little less free.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:32.560]   And I know from observation that that childhood is no longer a living presence in the town
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.760]   where I grew up.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:38.480]   It is not a living presence where I am now, and I do not see it when I drive through any
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.160]   American town anywhere.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:46.480]   But children are owed a real child's life by rights.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:52.880]   They ought to be outdoors, without adult supervision, with other children of various ages and from
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.000]   various families, doing things that children have always done.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.240]   That life is not only good for them, it is good for U.S.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:07.120]   grown-ups. Jane Jacobs, the astute liberal critic of American city planning, pointed
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.560]   out that it's children that bind a neighborhood or a town together.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.280]   That's because children crisscross through streets and yards and all the routines of
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.640]   adult business.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.560]   Children provide ready occasions for adults to get to know each other.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.680]   Children provide them with the motive to do more than that.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.640]   They are the excuse for many a festival.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.400]   You will say that that's all well and good if you can afford to live on one salary.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.840]   But here, the habits have been transformed into necessities.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:38.480]   It is not simply that you, as an individual family, have to make enough money to afford
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.360]   a house.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   It is that housing prices generally have risen to what households can afford.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:49.520]   Imagine two auctions in two worlds selling the same product, but to audiences of different
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.240]   means.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.200]   It will get a higher price from the people with deeper pockets.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:57:02.000]   They will be no better off than they would have been had they been in that other world
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.280]   attending the other auction.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:10.160]   Or look around an expensive new subdivision where farmland once was and consider how much
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.680]   of its showy excess will have been purchased at the expense of a real child life.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   What the heck for?
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   With what gain in human happiness?
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.840]   Thus ends Esalen's quote.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.120]   So I'm answering your question, does Joshua see the value in women outside of the home
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.160]   working for pay?
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.800]   And my answer is unequivocally, yes, I do.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:40.480]   But I'm arguing, do you, Amy, or anyone else listening, of course, Amy, do you see the
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.120]   value of women working inside of the home working not for pay?
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:52.720]   My answer is that for every society that has forgotten that value, your culture will cease
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.680]   to exist.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:01.520]   The only way you've gotten thus far is by stealing our culture, those of us who reproduce,
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.880]   for a limited period of time.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.920]   I'm not angry about this, but I'm just trying to make an observation.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.720]   Let me pull down my tone just for a moment.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:15.280]   I say that because your culture, meaning you, the culture that doesn't value women, doesn't
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.320]   inside of the home, doesn't value women working not for pay, doesn't value children.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.200]   The only reason you're still alive is – or you're still going – the only reason we
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:31.280]   live at this moment in 2024, where you have become the dominant culture, is that for about
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:36.560]   the last 50 years, you caught a whole bunch of family people all around the world unawares.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:42.000]   And it's kind of like what happened with Christianity.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   As a Christian, I follow the statistics.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:51.200]   For decades, we lost untold numbers of our Christian children to secular people in the
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:51.520]   world.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.160]   Secularists used to boast about this in their public writings.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.120]   You could find it.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.400]   That, okay, you go ahead and raise your kids, but as soon as they get to school, we'll
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.120]   get them.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.960]   As soon as they get to college, we'll get them.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.320]   And that was true for a time.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.720]   Then we figured out what was happening.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.880]   We figured out that our ideological opponents were stealing all our children, and we figured
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.640]   out how to make sure that didn't happen.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.000]   And so we've gotten a lot better at keeping our children – not all of them, but we've
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.120]   gotten a lot better at keeping our children in the traditions.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.400]   So, similarly, you see the similar thing that has happened with culture.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.920]   Now, I'm not here talking about religion.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.680]   I'm just talking about people who procreate and who expand their cultures and those who
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.000]   don't.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.640]   The – I've come to like the term "urban monoculture" that Malcolm and Simone Collins
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:32.880]   use.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.280]   I think it's an apt term that I'm going to start using.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.720]   But the urban monoculture has only succeeded by sucking in children from the countryside
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.520]   around it.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:48.080]   So if you go into any city in the world, you go to Tokyo or you go to New York City or
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   you go to Seoul or you go to Philadelphia or you go to Delhi or anything like this,
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.720]   what these cities have done is they've sucked up all of the children from all of the families
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.520]   in the farmlands all around, and they've sucked them all in for a promise of more money,
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.840]   a better job, a better life.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.080]   And there's an element in which that's pretty true.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.160]   If you grew up in absolute destitute poverty, then you would say, "You know what?
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.680]   I'd like to be able to have enough to eat."
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.160]   But those city cultures, those urban monocultures will not exist in the future unless they continue
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.960]   stealing children from the countryside around.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.520]   So those of us with children who don't like our children being stolen actually have to
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.760]   sit back and say, "What do we do differently?
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.600]   How do we hang on to our children?
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.120]   Because I don't want my family line to end with my children.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.080]   I want to think about my children's children's children.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:38.880]   That's my goal.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.960]   So I need to build something that's sustainable.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.640]   So I need to understand the attraction and allure of the city, but I need to make sure
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.000]   that we don't fall prey to it."
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.960]   And so my comment is simply that do you see the value in women working inside the home?
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.600]   Do you see the value in women working not for pay?
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.360]   If you don't, then you're probably not going to have children.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.200]   And while it might be the case that the women who want to do that, they'll live their lives,
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.400]   what was that comedian who will get up and masturbate in the morning in her bed because
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.600]   she doesn't have children and she'll smoke pot with her friends in the afternoon and
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.960]   make a whole skit out of it?
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.360]   Great.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:19.840]   Go ahead.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.200]   Live the life.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:21.760]   It's fine.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.680]   It's a free country.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.960]   You can live that way.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.200]   You can do your best to share that message.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.600]   But I'm not willing to go down that path anymore because I also know that on the whole,
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:39.120]   women today report being far less happy than they once were, far less self-satisfied than
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.080]   they once were.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:45.040]   And all I got to do is fire up TikTok and I can find a whole generation of women whose
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.400]   mothers raised them to be positive career women who would say, "Wouldn't it be nice
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.080]   to just clean a house and cook my husband's supper?
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.280]   Wouldn't that be nice and raise some children that like me and know me and just live a more
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.080]   contented life?"
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.920]   You can decide.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.120]   It's a free country.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.720]   But why am I pushing back?
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.640]   Well, because I want us to exist.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.520]   I'm a humanist.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.120]   I want to see humans flourish.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.440]   And I want you and your family a few generations from now to be strong and growing.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.920]   I want your community, your culture, your town to be strong and growing, not the emptied
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.000]   out hellscape that you see all around the world.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.200]   If you think again I'm being hyperbolic, I'm not.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.200]   The United States, you're insulated from it.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:31.280]   But go and drive the countryside of Japan or Korea or Italy.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.320]   Go buy a one-euro town and try to live in a town where there's no people.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.280]   I'm simply saying to a lot of people that your neighborhoods suck.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.880]   Your lifestyle sucks.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.200]   It's stressful and it's not necessary.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.880]   Now, if you want to do it, go for it.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.440]   I'm not going to change it.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:55.200]   But the other lifestyle that appreciates children and marriage and family is actually kind of
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.360]   nice and it deserves respect, deserves appreciation.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:07.200]   Come to an event I host sometime and go and ask my wife if she'd like to go and have some
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.960]   other strange man boss or strange woman boss control her life and tell her what she can
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.000]   do versus her husband.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.720]   See what she says.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:15.920]   Go ahead.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.200]   So now going on to the other questions.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.000]   The next sub-question of does Joshua see the value in women outside of the home working
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.480]   for pay?
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.000]   I hope I've done a good job of saying yes, absolutely I see the value of it.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.080]   Do we see the value of the other and understand that there needs to be a balance?
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.080]   That was what I'm trying to strike at, is that women don't get to just sit around and
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.640]   not work.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:44.960]   But it is appropriate if women who want to have the ambition of working inside the home,
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.840]   not working for pay.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.600]   And that's probably a necessary thing for us to have a sustainable culture.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.040]   We want, next sub-component of this, we want an educated society.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.920]   And right now public school is the provider of that.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.720]   Do you want men teaching society's young children?
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.800]   I affirm that we want an educated society.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.680]   I question the premise that public school is the provider of that.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.080]   I'm not convinced that we should hold public school in high regard.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.400]   I'm not going to make a big thing of this.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.600]   I just question the premise.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.640]   I acknowledge that it may be a provider of that, but I'm not convinced it's all that
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   great a provider of that.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.720]   And I'm also not convinced that there wouldn't be a better alternative if public schools
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.080]   didn't exist.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:39.920]   One of the things that people often mistake is they mistake ignorance for dysfunction.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:47.920]   I recently released a podcast where I read a chapter on the death of the nation state.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:55.760]   It's pretty hard for most people like you and me to conceive of a world without nation
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.520]   states like we have today.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:07.200]   But that's more due to our historical ignorance than it is to any basic component of society.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:14.080]   Society functioned just fine before nation states existed, and it'll probably function
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.480]   just fine after nation states exist.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.000]   It'll just look different.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.200]   And so, similarly, I think it's absurd to think that you didn't have an educated society
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.840]   prior to the institution of government schools.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:35.520]   Now, you can go back and you can find compelling evidence, for example, that in colonial America,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.680]   the literacy rate of colonial America was near universal long before the imposition
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.560]   of government schools.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:49.600]   I've seen rebuttals to that, and I have not dug deeply enough in to say what's true
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.880]   and what's not true.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.840]   I don't know.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:59.440]   But I think the evidence of the very strong literacy rate of the colonies, the early American
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.640]   colonies, is very strong.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:06.240]   Just remember, if you want an example, that if you go back and you read the Federalist
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:11.200]   Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers, go back and remember that these publications
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.480]   were written as a public argument intended to sway the common man.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.760]   So you pull them open and you ask yourself if your current government school educated
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.560]   society can interact with the arguments in the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.400]   Papers and would be persuaded by that.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.480]   And then go ahead and turn on whatever the coming debate is between Donald Trump and
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.320]   President Biden and see what was better.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.680]   I think that there's good evidence to say that people prior to government schools were
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.520]   pretty well educated.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.000]   And because, and again, Amy, this is not about you, but just because you're ignorant of
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.320]   that fact doesn't mean that it isn't a fact or that there isn't a better alternative
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.120]   model.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.960]   Government schools are one model, but they're not necessarily the best model.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.720]   I would also question and say, what is an educated society in the first place?
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.840]   One thing that's fascinating to me is if you go back, you hear things where people
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.280]   would say things like, oh, so-and-so only had a sixth grade education.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.400]   The question is, what did a sixth grade education mean?
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:23.600]   I have in my homeschool library a complete set of the McGuffey Readers and also a complete
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.440]   set of Ray's Arithmetic.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.320]   McGuffey Readers and Ray's Arithmetic are examples of the kinds of school books that
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:38.240]   elementary school children used as their only school books.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:45.040]   If you completed a sixth grade education of McGuffey Readers and Ray's Arithmetic, you
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:53.120]   would probably be far ahead of the majority of high school graduates today just by completing
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.840]   those basic school books.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.160]   It wouldn't take you very long.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.720]   You could easily do it in sixth grades, and you'd be far ahead of the actual knowledge.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:08.640]   Now, would you know as much as today's median school graduate?
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.200]   I don't know.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:16.800]   There's a much more diverse range of knowledge that is expected of a graduate today, meaning
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.080]   that today we expect our graduates to have all kinds of scientific knowledge that was
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.720]   not generally emphasized a century or two ago.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.360]   We add on much higher levels of math expectation, whereas it was not expected that a high school
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.680]   student or a normal person needed to access advanced math.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.280]   I have the Ray's Arithmetic algebra.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.560]   It was just basic algebra and geometry, especially well-suited to daily factors.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.680]   But I don't think that you're going to win the argument that we're a much superiorly
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.600]   educated society on the whole today than before.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.800]   So I know that's not the main thrust of it, but I want to just – we need to learn to
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.440]   question these things and say, "Why do I believe what we believe?
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.680]   Do I believe that all the people in the past were ignorant?"
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:10.080]   Well, then why is it that Jane Austen's novels received – why did people suck up Jane Austen's
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:17.040]   novels or – who's the British writer, Oliver Twist – and why were these people so famous
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.800]   if they were so uneducated?
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.760]   Is there – do we just have to depend upon the model of government schools?
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.480]   So you say, "Do you want men teaching society's young children?"
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.800]   Why would you not want men teaching society's young children?
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.520]   I am perfectly happy to affirm that, yes, I want women teaching society's young children,
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.840]   but why would you not want men teaching society's young children?
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:46.640]   I don't see any reason why teaching young children should be either a male or a female
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.080]   role exclusively.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   Now, I think in general, it's probably the case that more women will be patient with
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.000]   young children than men, naturally.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.720]   I think it's also probably the case that it matters whether you're teaching a mixed
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:09.920]   classroom, which is a separate discussion in and of itself, but I think it's much more
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:18.320]   important that the teacher have a clear understanding of who he or she is teaching rather than who
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.440]   the teacher is.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.560]   My favorite teacher is Charlotte Mason.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.880]   Charlotte Mason was an incredible woman.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.520]   Her books today are giants in the education space.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.320]   She never had biological children, never married.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:42.560]   She dedicated her career to teaching, and she was way ahead of her time, and I think
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.080]   still today should be studied and studied and studied by any person who is interested
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.840]   in education because her insights on children and on the education of children are enormously
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.960]   important.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:04.800]   I would be thrilled for Charlotte Mason herself to teach my sons or my daughter, no problem
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.520]   whatsoever.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:16.000]   I would not be thrilled for Charlotte Mason or any teacher to teach my sons or my daughter
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.440]   in the same exact way because they are different.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.200]   They learn differently.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:28.640]   The environment, if it's all boys or all girls or boys and girls together, is very
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:35.200]   different, creates enormously different social dynamics, and it's very different.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:42.000]   So I would say instead of worrying about whether the person teaching society's young children
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:50.400]   is a man or a woman, we should be more focused on does the man or woman teaching understand
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.040]   who he or she is teaching.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:04.240]   There are young female teachers today who love boys, understand boys, and are so skilled
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.000]   at bringing out the best in boys.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.720]   I would bet there's not a man in the world who couldn't name several teachers who poured
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:19.520]   into his life and just helped him to flourish and to develop and to be incredibly powerful
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.000]   and strong and just - what man couldn't do that?
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:32.880]   I also know that there are teachers, young female teachers in classrooms today who hate
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.120]   boys and who consider it their personal goal to bring down the patriarchy and who take
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120]   joy in watching boys fail.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.440]   Both of those are true.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.640]   So we need to have these conversations so that we can understand what are we actually
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.680]   driving at here?
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.440]   Next question.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.640]   Do you want men caring for your daughter, wife, and sisters in sensitive areas, for
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.320]   example, OB/GYN care, medical care, mental and emotional health, etc.?
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.280]   My answer is absolutely.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.880]   I'm also entirely open to women being involved in that kind of work.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:15.840]   This is where we get into a question of competence versus identity.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:25.200]   In the United States, traditionally, we have had a culture of competence where we expected
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.200]   and demanded competence from people.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:34.480]   So, for example, one of my favorite heroes, heroine, heroines, one of my favorite heroines
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:44.320]   is Dr. Denmark, who was the first female doctor to graduate from - I forget the name of the
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.040]   academy that she graduated from many years ago.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.640]   She's my heroine because of her working life.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.880]   She worked actively as a pediatrician until she was 104, and she died at 114 after 10
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.160]   years of retirement.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.360]   I love her story.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.080]   And I found her story first, disconnected.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.440]   Later, I found out that my wife was a patient of hers when my wife was a baby.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.120]   She had been sick, and my mother-in-law had taken my wife to her as a patient when she
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.480]   was a baby and had received some very useful and satisfying advice from Dr. Denmark.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:28.560]   It used to be extremely meaningful to refer to Dr. Denmark with honor as the first female
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:35.920]   physician in her academic class or whatever, in her college in that time, because what
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:43.120]   we understood at that time was she had demonstrated her competence as a physician by passing through
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:49.280]   the same curriculum that men passed through in order to be qualified as physicians.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.440]   She received respect because of her accomplishments, and her accomplishments were noteworthy because
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.600]   at that time, women were not ordinarily becoming physicians.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:07.120]   Now, I'm open to the idea that all of those previous barring of women from all the stuff
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.840]   needed to go.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.040]   I'm totally open to that.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.120]   I'm not trying to go back into that, be dumb even if I were, because we're not living in
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:13.920]   that system.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.080]   I'm an enormous proponent and in favor of highly educated women.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.400]   My wife is highly educated.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.040]   My daughter will be highly educated.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.400]   I'm totally in favor of that.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.240]   So, but the point is that there was a system of meritocracy based on accomplishment.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.560]   We've replaced that now with the concept of identity, and the dominant cultural forces
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.680]   around have decided that identity is the primary thing.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.440]   So, we've watered down the barriers for accomplishment in favor of inclusion.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:52.320]   It's a pretty feminine thing, and this is one of the causal reasons that men are saying,
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.040]   "I don't care.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.320]   It doesn't mean anything.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.600]   I'm not going to do it."
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.400]   Men thrive on competition, and they've always respected women who were accomplished and
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:07.680]   who achieved, whereas in today's world, we have a very female-dominated system, and we've
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:16.960]   replaced accomplishment and externally proven achievement as our benchmark with inclusion
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.000]   as our benchmark.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.640]   Probably, they both should go together.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.760]   I think what's really beautiful is in a natural relationship, a natural husband and wife
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.240]   relationship that's good in every respect, you get a good buffering of each other's
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.360]   strengths and weaknesses.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.600]   So, probably, men and women should be working together on this, and there should be
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.920]   accomplishment and inclusion.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:45.280]   That's probably the ultimate benefit, but it's unproven that we can have both of them.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.040]   It seems like we've got to go back and forth.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.320]   So, back to the question that you said.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:57.280]   I'm totally fine with men being caregivers for my daughter and wife and sisters in
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.000]   sensitive areas.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.120]   It's always been that way.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:06.480]   Did a woman who was – where the family doctor came and helped her with the delivery of her
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.040]   baby, was she upset because he was a man?
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.340]   No.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.600]   Generally speaking, no.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:19.840]   I do affirm, however, that there is something really beautiful about women being involved,
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.360]   especially with women.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.040]   And so, there are male midwives in the world.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.440]   I've never wished for one.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.920]   I've always been enormously grateful that we've had wonderful female midwives.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.080]   There are plenty of male obstetrician-gynecologists out there.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.200]   I've never wished for one.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.600]   I'm grateful that there are wonderful female OBGYNs.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.440]   I'm a little less confident with regard to counseling.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.920]   I am not sure about most of the world of mental health and psychiatry, and I get
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.400]   concerned about the difference in a male worldview and a female worldview, but I'm
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.560]   entirely open to it, just more cautious in that space than I am in the other spaces.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:14.080]   The point, however, that I was driving at is simply the system of dual-income households
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.160]   is unsustainable.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.800]   And so, if we're going to continue it, we have to find new solutions.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.200]   Now, you were responding, Amy, to a particular episode that was just talking about young
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.840]   men, but that one came in the context of a couple other multi-hour episodes that probably
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.400]   also influenced your questions, where I'm talking about the unsustainability of our
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.520]   current model.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:43.360]   So, my argument is not that women shouldn't be doctors and psychiatrists and all that
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.640]   stuff in any way.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.560]   What I'm saying is that if all of our women are becoming doctors, and if becoming a
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.120]   doctor is likely to lead to a woman not having any babies or only one or two babies, as
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.760]   the data seems to indicate, generally speaking, then when we have more women doctors,
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.120]   we're not going to have any babies.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.720]   So, what can we do?
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:10.000]   Well, if my daughter is going to become a doctor, what are the choices that we can
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.640]   make?
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   Well, first, she could put all of her focus into becoming a doctor, and she could believe
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.680]   that her job and her career is going to be the primary thing that gives her meaning in
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.400]   life.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.240]   That's a choice that she makes.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.760]   And so, I'm going to prepare her, educationally speaking, that she can flourish in that world
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.720]   and be really good at it if that's the choice that she decides to make.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.160]   I think the data would indicate that that's probably not going to be a very satisfying
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.440]   choice for her.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:46.160]   I think that it's pretty obvious that while it may be right for some women, on the whole,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.800]   most women would like to have a slightly different life and lifestyle than what is
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.720]   described exclusively by that.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:58.160]   So, how are we going to integrate her love of being a doctor with her ability to have
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.920]   children and get married?
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.800]   Well, we have a couple of other things that we can work with.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.760]   Number one, we can work with her age.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.560]   Maybe she can go to medical school at the age of 15.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.640]   Okay, I'm open to that.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.600]   Seems a little extreme to me, but I'm open to that.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.640]   Maybe we can redesign education so that she can, instead of high school, she can be doing
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.360]   her medical school so that she's a doctor sooner, so that she can get established herself
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.280]   and get ahead in her career and still be able to do that in time for her to have children
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.440]   before the biological window is closed.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.640]   That's an option.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.240]   Another option is for us to redesign the career track.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.960]   So, why shouldn't she get married and have children while she's in medical school?
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.680]   That's an option.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.080]   And that would be especially great if it were an option where she worked for longer.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:51.360]   So, why do we have to pressure women to say you have to start your career on exactly the
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.840]   same schedule as men, knowing that it means that they're probably going to not be able
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.960]   to achieve their goals of having the number of children that they want to have?
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.480]   Why not have it start earlier?
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:08.640]   We need at least about 10 years for her to be free of overwhelming career and work obligations
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:13.040]   so that she can be really present and focused with having babies and taking care of young
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.480]   children, things like that.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:18.000]   It might be nice to have 20, but 10 is better than nothing.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.880]   Or, so that's a lever we can push on so that she can be more free, and maybe she just starts
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.560]   on a deferred basis.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.240]   Another thing that can be a push on is let's redesign the rigor of it.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.360]   So, maybe instead of it being she does it all the time and she has to do it six days
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.920]   a week, 80 hours a week on call all the time, maybe we can design a career that's more friendly
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.440]   to her job as a mother.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.040]   Something I frequently recommend to doctors is can you still be a physician?
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.120]   Just be less of a physician.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:51.840]   Do it 60% so you gain the good without the things that are overwhelming.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840]   And then, can she work for longer?
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.160]   Now, one of the things I know, which is always hard to put together, is people say on the
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.520]   one hand that they're just living for their career and they're so satisfied and they're
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.880]   so fulfilled, but I, as a financial planner, talk to a whole lot of people who are trying
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.760]   to get out of their jobs and their careers as quickly as possible.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.600]   So, I just assume that for some people it is, for some people it's not, some people
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:18.080]   they want different things, and so maybe they can work for longer.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.320]   So, again, Dr. Denmark, she worked as a physician until she was 104.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:27.360]   She had a child, so maybe she raised – I don't remember all the details of her job,
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.400]   but she was good.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.120]   Or I think of someone like Francis Hesselbein.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.200]   Francis Hesselbein, famous leader who was a housewife and a mother.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.920]   I think she had one baby and she was just a very simple woman until she was in her 50s
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:44.000]   when she really started her career and her career really took off for her.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.920]   And she had developed amazing leadership ability with all of her local groups and the things
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.560]   that she was involved in with her community.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:59.200]   She had joined the Girl Scouts as a volunteer troop leader, and ultimately she became the
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.400]   CEO of the Girl Scouts back in the 1970s, and then she worked for the Girl Scouts from
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.840]   the 1970s to the early '90s, and then she just continued on and she had all kinds of
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.240]   other work until ultimately she died at 107.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.320]   I don't think she ever retired from that point.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.440]   So, that's a great model that we should consider that would allow these things to
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.720]   work out well.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.800]   So, I'm not trying to keep women out of any of these things.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.240]   I'm trying to insert the idea that we have to reconsider how we do this.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:34.960]   And I'm also trying to insert the idea that family is an important consideration.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   It's something that I apply to my own life in all of my thinking.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.080]   I'm not laser focused right now at this stage of my life.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.120]   I'm making as much money as I can and going for the moon.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:45.360]   Why?
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.920]   I have children and so I want to have children and that is going to involve some costs and
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:53.040]   sacrifices to my career and my opportunities.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.040]   I also want to defend the fact that there are a lot of women who would be perfectly
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.000]   happy having nothing to do with the career world and would be perfectly happy to be wives
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:02.800]   and mothers.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   And I want to defend their rights to that decision just as vigorously as anyone else
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.400]   because I think they often get stepped on in today's world and they get ignored.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.080]   And the fact remains that I'm perfectly happy with that.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.320]   There's a lot of men who are very happy with that.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.800]   And I like having a trophy wife that is my wife and that's it.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.120]   And that's something that's perfectly reasonable.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.800]   I'm not going to set that as the only course for my daughter.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.800]   I'm not going to tell her, "Well, honey, if you can just look pretty and, you know,
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.880]   learn how to do your nails better and learn how to cook a better sandwich, then that's
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.720]   just going to solve all of your problems in life."
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.520]   Obviously not.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:45.760]   My wife, sorry, my daughter is, my vision is going to be a matriarch someday.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:51.520]   And so I've got to prepare her for that because she's got to be the strongest, most well-educated,
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.080]   most thoughtful, most well-prepared woman in the world to be a wife and mother.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.560]   And so that's not, like, I don't want a lazy wife.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.280]   I don't want an unaccomplished wife.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.080]   I don't see why, I don't think the standards are any somehow higher that a woman is more
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.000]   noble because, "Well, I finished my PhD and I got this high-powered job."
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.240]   Great.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:12.720]   Good for you.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.520]   Go for it.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.320]   Wonderful.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.760]   That doesn't make you any more noble than anyone else who also works and has a different
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.040]   perspective and is very well-prepared for a different kind of work.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:30.480]   So I think that you're drawing these questions from a straw man that perhaps, by virtue of
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:36.480]   our culture, straw manning the decisions of women into somehow making it seem like they're
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.200]   incompetent.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:45.760]   And I would submit from the men that I know and the men that I listen to, for example,
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.360]   if you listen to the culture, there's this meme that men are intimidated by strong, educated,
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.720]   competent, independent women.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.400]   I don't know any men who are intimidated by strong, educated, competent, independent
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:58.800]   women.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.200]   I'm surrounded in my life by strong, educated, competent, independent women.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.920]   I'm not intimidated.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.120]   It's not a thing.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.720]   Women might think it's not a thing.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.920]   No one's intimidated by it.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:18.800]   The point comes down to the toxicity, that there is a culture that creates toxic women,
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.640]   that hate men and despise men rather than love them and appreciate them.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:31.120]   I think it's an unfortunate artifact of the cultural formation things, that women live
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.920]   in fear of men, and then they learn to hate men in many cases, and then they despise men,
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.040]   and the men just observe it and say, "Yeah, I'm not intimidated.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.480]   I'm just not attracted."
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   And I don't think those have to be the case.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.240]   I know lots of strong, independent, accomplished, beautifully educated, very successful women
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.480]   who are wonderfully sweet, and attractive, and kind, and you love being around them,
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.080]   and you love talking to them.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.640]   These things are not necessarily in competition.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.880]   They're not incompatible.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.760]   They just need to be thought about and intelligently managed.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.960]   Now, the next question, do you want men in positions of risk where it goes unchecked?
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.720]   For example, banking and investing, health care politics, uncharted technology.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:23.680]   It's a strange question, because it implies that men are unchecked if they're in those
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.480]   situations.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:31.600]   I'm not going to argue this one too forcefully.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:40.160]   What I would say, though, is the best people to check men are generally men, and men are
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.120]   most willing to check one another if women are not present.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:53.040]   So I think you have a misunderstanding of male culture and a misunderstanding of what
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:00.880]   changes when men and women are in mixed company as compared to men in a male-only environment.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.120]   Men love to correct other men.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:12.240]   Men will always stand up and check other men when they see excess.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.640]   History is full of that.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:21.600]   And I would just ask you, ask the men in your life where they're more likely to speak up.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.320]   It's in a masculine environment.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.440]   When you're in a genuine, in a true men, and by true, I just mean men are only there, and
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.840]   men are only there, and men are only watching and talking to each other, men generally have
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.880]   no problem standing up for one another because they're not performing.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.240]   And they do that because they care about the issue, not about the people.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:48.400]   When women are introduced into that environment, I don't know, maybe there's benefits to it,
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.160]   but I'm going to guess that it's probably more negative because it changes the cultural
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:52.560]   environment.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.280]   Because now men engage in performative stuff for women, and they're thinking about how
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.400]   the women perceive them instead of focusing on the actual issue at hand.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.960]   One of the things that's unique about male culture is that you can get a group of men
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:10.160]   in the room together, and those men can have a literal yelling match with one another.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:15.040]   And then they can solve the underlying issue, and boom, it's done.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.320]   It's forgotten.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:16.800]   It's forgiven.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.600]   There's no, it's just, we don't, no grudges held.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.000]   It's done.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:27.440]   Men can interact with each other in the sharpest and most externally like divisive seeming
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.080]   ways, but they're focused on finding the truth.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.760]   And that's what you want in an environment where there's a potential for abuse.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.800]   I can't prove it.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:44.960]   I would say that it's probably more negative to have men and women tiptoeing around things,
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.320]   trying to figure out how to talk to one another in a professional context when really important
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:55.920]   risk is on the line, as an example in banking and investing and in healthcare and in politics
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.520]   and things like that.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.440]   Let me bring in here in this context one paragraph from an excellent book by Dr.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:08.560]   Leonard Sachs called "Boys Adrift," and he's talking in a chapter about team and
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.400]   competition with men.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:15.760]   And this is an interesting, he's talking about the importance of competition for boys
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.560]   because competition creates motivation.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.000]   And here's his comment.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.920]   "Why doesn't this approach," meaning the approach of encouraging competition among
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.440]   boys, "Why doesn't this approach work as well for many girls?
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.480]   Here's why.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.000]   Most girls value friendship above team affiliation.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.280]   If Emily and Melissa are best friends and you put Emily and Melissa on opposing teams,
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.440]   both girls may be uncomfortable.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:44.560]   Emily doesn't want to make Melissa sad, so she may be reluctant to beat Melissa.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.840]   She'd rather play alongside Melissa than try to make her lose.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.800]   But if Justin and Jared are best friends and you put them on opposing teams, Justin will
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.600]   happily run down the field and knock Jared down.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.320]   In that situation, I've seen Jared get up, dust himself off and say to Justin, "You
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.600]   think that was a good hit?
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.000]   Ha, I'll get you better next time."
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   That kind of good-natured competition actually builds their friendship.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.800]   Boys are more likely to understand that friends don't have to be teammates and teammates don't
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.000]   have to be friends.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.920]   And boys are more likely to be invested in the success of their team regardless of whether
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.840]   any of their friends are on the team.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:25.040]   I'll read another segment in a moment, but I would encourage you the books by Leonard
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.040]   Sachs, "Boys Adrift" is one, "Girls on the Edge" is another.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:34.640]   They're both excellent and important to talk about these issues in context so that we can
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:35.440]   think about it.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.480]   So that's my answer to that.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.200]   Now, the next question you said, "Should there be women-only clubs?
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.600]   Why doesn't this matter?"
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:50.480]   My answer is absolutely there should be women-only clubs and you and your daughters need to be
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.200]   in them and creating them and starting them.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:57.760]   This is enormously important for the development of your daughters.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.960]   I'm going to read now from Dr. Leonard Sachs' book called "Girls Adrift," chapter seven,
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.440]   spirit.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.760]   First two introductory paragraphs, "Up to this point, we've addressed areas where I
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.080]   think and hope we can all be in agreement.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:14.800]   Every girl should use her mind to be in control of her emotions rather than her emotions controlling
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.520]   her.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.720]   Every girl should strive to be physically fit within healthy limits.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.080]   While we may not always agree about the best strategies to achieve these objectives, we
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:27.600]   all agree on the objectives for every girl to fulfill her physical and intellectual potential.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:31.600]   But when we turn to matters of the spirit, some parents are uncomfortable."
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.240]   And he goes on, "When I'm speaking to parents and I say something like, 'For some girls,
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.560]   life is about more than just mind and body, the core of their identity is all about the
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.480]   spiritual journey,' I see some parents grow visibly restless.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.400]   It's easy to understand why.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:51.920]   10 or 20 or 30 years ago, some of these parents were themselves teenagers who rebelled against
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.680]   their own parents' attempts to indoctrinate them into a particular religion.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.920]   Often, they don't see the point of religious involvement or even spiritual engagement in
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.440]   the 21st century."
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:07.760]   And he goes on and he talks about how girls develop in their spirit and gives various
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.480]   examples.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.000]   And here's a subsection called "A Community of Girls and Women."
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.480]   "A community of girls and women.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.560]   Community matters.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.200]   The kind of community in which your daughter engages will shape the person she becomes.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.720]   In chapter two, I described how a girl growing up 40 or 50 years ago was more likely to be
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.120]   involved in communities that included adult women, whether at church, in her extended
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.880]   family, in a sewing circle, or just sitting on her neighbor's front porch.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.160]   Today, a girl's community is more likely to consist primarily of other girls her own
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:40.560]   age.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:47.280]   That means girls talking mostly with other girls, but girl talk can be toxic to girls,
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.640]   even when they don't mean it to be.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:54.160]   When girls talk with one another, the most popular topics tend to include their own personal
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.120]   problems.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.120]   That's as true of nine-year-old girls as it is of 19-year-old women.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:04.000]   All too often, the sharing and self-disclosure can spin into an obsessive rehash of negative
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:04.960]   emotion.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.640]   As the old saying goes, "Rolling in the mud is not the best way of getting clean."
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.600]   "When girls are talking about these problems, it probably feels good to get that level of
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.000]   support and validation," says Amanda Rose, professor of psychology at the University
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:18.880]   of Missouri.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.360]   "But they are not putting two and two together, that actually this excessive talking can make
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.320]   them feel worse."
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.160]   Dr. Rose and her colleagues call this phenomenon "co-rumination."
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.880]   It seems to be increasingly common among girls today, but remains rare among boys.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:40.480]   The essence of co-rumination is that talking with same-age peers about personal problems
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.000]   makes girls more anxious.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.120]   Tessa Lee Thomas, 13 years old, gave a reporter an example of how it can happen.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.200]   "Sometimes we get into disagreements, and we have to settle them.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:54.960]   My friends think that my other friend did something wrong, but she didn't do something
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.680]   wrong.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.760]   Sometimes it makes the situation worse than where we were when we began.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.920]   It spiraled into something bigger than it was."
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:07.040]   That's what can happen when girls counsel other girls, because girls providing counsel
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.080]   to same-age girls isn't the right kind of community.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.480]   The right kind of community bridges the generations, connecting girls with women.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.640]   The right kind of community involves girls learning from women their mother's age and
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.240]   their grandmother's age.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.560]   Older women can provide your daughter with mature context and perspective.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.440]   Girls who are the same age as your daughter can't do that.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.040]   It doesn't have to be anything formal or structured.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.120]   Sophia was a high school girl working part-time as a receptionist at a medical clinic when
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.600]   she told me how much she valued the opinions and support provided by her co-workers at
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.640]   the clinic, all of whom are adult women.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:48.000]   She had a huge crush on a guy at her high school, and he was taking advantage of her.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.680]   The other girls at the high school saw nothing wrong with what was going on.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.080]   In fact, they envied her because he was popular and athletic, and he wasn't being physically
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.600]   intimate with anybody else.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.480]   But he wasn't making any promises to her either.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.400]   When she told the older women in her office about it, they offered a different perspective.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.640]   Quote, "If you act like a doormat, don't be surprised when he steps all over you,"
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.600]   one of them told her.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.080]   Quote, "If you let him treat you like a piece of meat, don't be surprised if he chews you
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.080]   up and spits you out," said another older woman.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.720]   Sophia broke off the relationship, if you could call a series of late-night booty calls
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.840]   a relationship.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.120]   He wasn't phased at all.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.560]   He was like, "Okay, whatever.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.840]   I was getting tired of it anyhow."
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.960]   I think he said that just to be mean, but it proves that the women at work were right.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.640]   He wasn't serious about us, about having a relationship.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.400]   He was just using me.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.200]   How does a girl become a woman?
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.000]   What does it mean to be a "real" woman?
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.960]   These are questions that almost every enduring culture has answered by providing a community
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.440]   of women to show girls the way.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.960]   I'm not talking only about mothers teaching their daughters, but about a community of
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.640]   women teaching the girls.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.360]   We used to have many such communities in the United States, formal and informal.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.800]   Quilting circles, sewing circles, all-female Bible study groups, all-female book clubs,
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.120]   Girl Scout troops, the variety of women's clubs that operated in association with the
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.840]   General Federation of Women's Clubs, and so forth.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.840]   Remnants of such groups still exist, but girls today are much more likely to hang out with
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.000]   other girls their age than they are to mix socially with women their parents' age.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.040]   I'm going to insert Joshua's snide comment.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:29.280]   Because their mothers are all at work and don't have time to facilitate the cultural
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.120]   groups that they should be facilitating, because their mothers are all busy at their jobs.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.080]   Forgive the snide comment.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.040]   Girls teaching same-age girls what it means to be a woman is a new phenomenon in human
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.920]   history.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.640]   It's equivalent to the blind leading the blind.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.200]   Teenage girls don't have the wisdom, experience, and perspective that a 35-year-old woman or
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.120]   a 65-year-old woman can provide.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.600]   Many cultures have rituals to mark a girl's passage into womanhood.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.000]   The Quinceañera in many Spanish-speaking cultures, the relatively recent emergence
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.240]   of the bat mitzvah in many Jewish communities today, and Kenalda'a among the Navajo are
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.040]   three examples.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:13.360]   But as the demise of the early 20th century debutante ball illustrates, these coming-of-age
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:19.520]   rituals for girls can be empty or even counterproductive if the focus shifts from identity to surface,
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.120]   from a focus on who you are to a focus on how you look.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.680]   And even with the best of intentions, a one-day ritual like a bat mitzvah or Quinceañera
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.800]   isn't enough.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.960]   One day or one week isn't enough.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.800]   Girls need a community that lasts.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.680]   Some girls' schools understand this.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.400]   A girls' school can easily provide an authentic community of girls and women, as long as the
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.280]   leadership of the school understands the reality that the school's mission must go beyond
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.480]   academics.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.600]   Men may be fine for teaching girls English or Spanish or mathematics or social studies.
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.760]   Indeed, some of the most effective and most popular teachers I have met at girls' schools
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.800]   have been men.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.240]   But only a woman can teach girls what it means to be a woman, how each girl must figure out
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.920]   for herself how she will express and balance her inner feminine and her inner masculine.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.480]   I have visited a number of girls' schools, such as Lauriston in Australia, Oakcrest School
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.000]   in Virginia, and the Pace Center in Orlando, that consciously, thoughtfully, and intentionally
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.400]   provide that community of women for girls.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.560]   But the great majority of girls attend a co-ed school.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.760]   You can't expect most co-ed schools to have much interest in creating all-female communities.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.000]   You may have to take the lead yourself.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.480]   You need to create an alternative counterculture in which it's cool for girls to spend time
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.000]   in a community of women.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.920]   If your daughter attends a co-ed school, then you might look to your church or synagogue
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.920]   or mosque to provide that community.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.080]   If you don't belong to a local church or synagogue or mosque, consider joining one.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.000]   Not for your sake, but for your daughter's.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.200]   If your church or synagogue or mosque doesn't offer an all-female religious retreat, try
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.640]   to organize one.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.880]   Remind the leaders of your congregation that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam each have
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:05.520]   long traditions of celebrating all-female religious communions in community.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.000]   No men allowed.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.600]   Most churches and synagogues and mosques in North America offer youth groups for children
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.800]   and teenagers.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.320]   These groups are usually co-ed and stratified by age.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.320]   A typical youth group activity nowadays is a pizza party or an outing to the bowling
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.800]   alley for all the ninth grade girls and boys together.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.480]   But everything we've learned suggests that a better approach might be to offer a single
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.000]   sex group, not stratified by age.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.800]   In fact, it might be time to rethink the whole idea of the church youth group or synagogue
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.800]   youth group or Muslim youth group.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.720]   These groups should not be about teens hanging out with teens.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.080]   If teens want to hang out with teens, most of them don't need any help from the church
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.840]   or the synagogue or the mosque.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:54.480]   The church or synagogue or mosque should offer opportunities for activities that the kids
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.880]   can't easily arrange by themselves.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.040]   For example, an all-female hiking trip along a stretch of the Appalachian Trail or an all-female
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.480]   canoe trip with girls from age 11 on up to grandmothers.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.800]   You don't have to tie into an established organization or religious group to do this.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.720]   Organize a get-together with half a dozen girls and at least two adult women.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:18.960]   You might create a sewing circle if you or a friend of yours knows how to sew.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.560]   You could organize a once-a-month cooking or baking club with the club meeting at a
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.240]   different girl's house each month.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.320]   In December, you make holiday treats.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.840]   In the summer, you make slushies and smoothies, something different each season.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.040]   My wife, my daughter, and I recently visited my brother's family in Shaker Heights, Ohio.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.960]   When my brother's wife, Linda, heard that my daughter, Sarah, likes to knit,
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.320]   Linda invited Sarah to come with her to a little shop in Shaker called Around the Table Yarns.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.040]   When Sarah entered the shop, she encountered a single large table with women of all different
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.880]   ages, including one other teenage girl seated around the table.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:55.760]   One grandmother was knitting an elephant for her grandchild.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.840]   The room was lined with cubbyholes filled with skeins of yarn for sale,
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.120]   from inexpensive cotton thread to luxurious cashmere.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.800]   But you don't have to pay anything or buy anything in order to sit at the table and knit.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.840]   Anybody is welcome to come in and sit down, as long as you want to knit.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.280]   The two owners, Pam and Beth, will be happy to help you with any problems
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.120]   you're having with your knitting project.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:17.840]   No charge.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:21.360]   Linda told me later, "I've made so many friends there.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.920]   I meet someone new almost every time I go.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.200]   You can talk about your kids, your family, your vacation plans.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.720]   Nobody looks at their phones.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   We're really just enjoying each other.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.480]   At Starbucks, everybody is looking at their phone, or they're talking to the one person
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.760]   they brought with them.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.960]   At this shop, people are sitting around the table and talking.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.160]   With everybody.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.520]   That's what the place is for.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.960]   Sometimes people bring in home-baked cookies to share.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.600]   It's a relaxed place to create bonds across generations, where a 13-year-old girl like
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.560]   my daughter can easily strike up a conversation with a 74-year-old grandmother, and everybody's
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.440]   having a good time.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:00.720]   If sewing, knitting, and baking seem gender-stereotyped to you, then come up with something else.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.040]   Maybe a backcountry hiking or fishing trip.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.080]   It's not about the activity.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.320]   The sewing, the knitting, and the baking are only an excuse to get women and girls together,
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.160]   to create an opportunity for connection.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.880]   Your group should bridge the generations.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:19.920]   That means ideally involving not just other parents, but also grandparents.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:24.000]   Encourage your daughter to develop friendships with women your age and your mother's age.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.040]   Sometimes we just need to rediscover old ways of connecting girls with women.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:32.800]   Sewing circles were never primarily about sewing.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:37.840]   They were about women and girls helping each other, which included helping girls to negotiate
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.840]   the transitions through adolescence and into womanhood.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:46.080]   The challenges are different today, of course, but the value of a mature adult perspective
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.040]   hasn't changed.
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:52.560]   Your daughter may know more than you do about how to upload videos from a cell phone to
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:58.720]   a YouTube channel, but you know more than she does about how alcohol affects the behavior
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:43:59.760]   of teenage boys.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.960]   She needs your perspective and the perspective of other adults your age and older.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:10.640]   Don't let your daughter fall into the trap of thinking that her knowledge is a substitute
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.840]   for your wisdom.
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.560]   As Bly and Woodman observed, the average 12-year-old girl today knows more about the
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:22.480]   varieties of human sexual experience than the average 60-year-old knew in 1890, for
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.680]   example, regarding oral sex and anal intercourse.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.160]   But knowledge is not the same thing as wisdom.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:33.520]   Most girls today don't fully understand the harm that sex can do to a girl, to her
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.920]   spirit, if it's sex at the wrong time in her life or sex with the wrong person.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.760]   That understanding is not a matter of knowledge.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.120]   It's a matter of wisdom.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.520]   Very few 12-year-old girls, or boys, have that wisdom, and it can't easily be taught
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.520]   in a sex education class.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.800]   That's why they need you and other adults your age.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:59.600]   I was discussing this topic with Rev. Alan James, who has hosted me on several speaking
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.360]   engagements in Minnesota.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.480]   When Rev. James was pastor of the Small Presbyterian Church in Maple Plain, Minnesota, he helped
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.360]   to organize summer canoeing trips, girls with women, and separate trips for boys and
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:11.860]   men.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.320]   In a typical trip, eight girls and eight women would gather at the headwaters of the
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.360]   Namakagon River in Wisconsin.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.520]   They would canoe down the Namakagon to the St. Croix River, which divides Wisconsin
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.320]   from Minnesota.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.440]   That canoe ride is on the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway, managed by the National Park
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.240]   Service, and the Park Service maintains many beautiful campsites accessible only from the
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.120]   river.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.920]   A typical trip begins with one girl paired with one woman, and together they canoe to
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.720]   the first stop, about two hours downriver.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.400]   They pull the canoe off the river at the designated campsite and wait for the other
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.600]   pairs to join them.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.280]   They all make lunch together.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.200]   Then the girl gets back in the canoe with a different woman for another two-hour trip
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.160]   downriver.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.320]   They pull off the river at the next campsite, where they gather brush and prepare a campfire.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.520]   All the girls and women then cook supper together.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.280]   They sit around the campfire, tell stories, sing songs.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.720]   Then they go to sleep in their tents, three days and two nights.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.440]   Each two-hour trek downriver, the girl is paired with a different woman.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:18.000]   Two hours in a canoe on a quiet, beautiful river is a great opportunity for a girl to
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.840]   talk to a woman, to listen to a woman, and to learn from a woman.
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:27.360]   Rev. James told me that the river excursions were very popular in his day, but that his
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.760]   former church no longer offers them.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.880]   He isn't sure why.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.640]   I think I know why.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:37.680]   Parents today are less likely than parents in previous generations to tell their daughter
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.360]   what the daughter will be doing this summer.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.600]   Instead, today's parents are more likely to ask the daughter what the daughter wants
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:43.920]   to do.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:49.360]   And very few girls today will answer, "Well, what I'd really like to do is spend three
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.440]   days canoeing down the Namakagon River with some random group of women from the church
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.320]   who I don't even know."
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.800]   Instead, the girl says, "I'd like to do the summer session at Stanford University
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.240]   for top high school students.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.560]   I think that would look great on my college application."
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.120]   Or she says, "I'd like to go to the summer intensive field hockey program.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.680]   I think it would improve my chances of getting a scholarship at an NCAA Division I program.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.800]   I'm thinking UConn."
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.640]   Or she says, "I want to work on my YouTube channel.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.880]   I want to be the next JoJo Siwa."
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.800]   If you don't know who JoJo Siwa is, you might start by watching her YouTube channel,
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.280]   YouTube video Boomerang, which she made at 12 years of age and which has had over 840
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.480]   million views on YouTube.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:34.320]   These experiences at Stanford, at the hockey field camp, or in the bedroom making a YouTube
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.120]   video are very different from one another.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.560]   What they have in common is an emphasis on performance, on impressing other people with
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.080]   how amazing you are.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.640]   None of them invites or requires a spiritual journey.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:54.640]   None of them will nurture your girl's core sense of identity, her sense of who she is
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.880]   as something separate from what she does.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.040]   Contemporary North American popular culture does not value bonds across generations.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.720]   There are very few shows on broadcast or cable TV, very few popular videos on YouTube that
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.880]   portray their value and significance.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:16.400]   That means you can't wait for your daughter to ask for an activity that nurtures and promotes
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.760]   intergenerational bonds.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:23.680]   You have to find such an activity, creating it from scratch if necessary, and then offer
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.240]   it to her.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.960]   That's what Yolanda Zhang did.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.400]   She created a program called Girl Strong, specifically to grow these bonds across generations.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.840]   Her program has five components, or pillars.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.680]   One of the five pillars is a weekend overnight mother-daughter retreat at Albion Hills Conservation
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.720]   Park, about an hour's drive northwest of Toronto.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.120]   The weekend includes a ropes course where girls have to work as a team with their moms
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:54.160]   to walk along ropes suspended midair, building shelter and starting a fire using materials
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.720]   nearby, using a rope swing to get from one platform to another, and so forth.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.480]   Parents are enthusiastic about Zhang's program.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.480]   One mother described how the program has "done wonders for my daughter.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.160]   Her teachers at school have all remarked at how much she is coming out of her shell."
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.200]   Another mom reports how her daughter, since participating in the mother-daughter weekend,
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:19.360]   now amazes her with her ability to speak confidently in front of strangers.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.000]   One weekend won't change everything, but it's a start.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.040]   And not every parent can be a Yolanda Zhang, but you must try to find a program like hers
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:29.760]   for your daughter.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:36.800]   "If we choose, we can accept our unique place in history," wrote Bly and Woodman.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.200]   For the first time in history, there is a general international consensus among educated
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:46.240]   people that girls and women have a fundamental right to equal opportunity.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.480]   For the past three decades, most of us have assumed that the best way to ensure equal
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:56.240]   opportunity is to pretend that girls and women are more or less the same as boys and men,
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.160]   that we should instruct them in the same sports in the same way and that they have the same
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.040]   spiritual needs.
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.160]   That assumption hasn't worked very well.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.880]   In matters of the spirit, as in athletics, simply lifting the strategies that have been
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.080]   used for boys and applying them to girls in gender-blind fashion doesn't work well for
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:15.200]   many girls.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.200]   We have to recognize that girls need girl-specific interventions.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:24.560]   Sewing circles might not be the best way to engage boys in a community of men, but I'm
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.080]   hearing about some communities where it seems to be a great idea for girls.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:34.880]   If girls are not healthy spiritually, they may find themselves not so much living as
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.080]   performing.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:40.320]   I discussed in Chapter 2 how easily this can happen in the era of social media.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.960]   The technology of social networking sites and texting make it easy for girls to think
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.040]   they are living their own lives, when in fact they are really putting on a show for their
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:49.520]   peers.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:55.920]   Even back in the 1990s, years before modern social media even existed, Marion Woodman
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:01.520]   wrote that most girls "have been performing since they were tiny children.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:07.760]   They don't know that there's any other way to live except for the voice inside that's
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:11.440]   saying, 'If this is it, it's not worth living.'
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:16.800]   Today, that problem is more severe."
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:23.920]   I would encourage you to read Girls on the Edge.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.560]   It's a great book.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:28.080]   But the point is, absolutely.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:37.360]   Women need women-only clubs, just like men need men-only clubs.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:45.040]   I would love to be living next to that knitting shop, and I would be getting my wife and daughter
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.600]   in there as often as possible.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.320]   I do now.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:56.000]   Every single time there's any conceivable female event, my wife has a little club.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:56.960]   She calls it Book Club.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:00.080]   But they don't actually read any books.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.680]   It started as a book club around one book, and then it just turned into a group of women
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:08.480]   who got together regularly, and they don't read books, but they still call it Book Club.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.960]   But it's just a way of girls getting together.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.600]   And this is really, really important.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.680]   And it's doable to create in an ad hoc basis.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:22.320]   If you have a healthy church or a healthy homeschool co-op or a healthy community, then
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.320]   naturally women who are wise understand we need this.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:30.720]   My sisters always did it by hosting tea parties, and they would regularly host a tea party,
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:34.880]   and you get everyone from the 85-year-old to the 5-year-old all together to drink tea.
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.320]   And so you try to find a female version of that.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.800]   And men need it just as much.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.520]   The problem is, as I said in a different episode, those places have disappeared.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:47.760]   The closest I can come up with is a cigar lounge.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:53.200]   I love going to cigar lounges, primarily because they're one of the very few male-dominated
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.240]   places I can find.
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:53:00.000]   I used to go to a barbershop in Florida, and the barbershop was for years – it was a
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.760]   traditional men's barbershop.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:07.920]   There were no female barbers, and it was all men, all male patrons.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:12.000]   And occasionally a woman would come in with her child and cut the baby's hair, the child's
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.120]   hair, but it was all men.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.840]   That was the barbershop I grew up being taken to by my dad, and it was great.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:20.880]   And then in comes a woman barber.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:21.760]   Okay, fine.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.240]   Women are perfectly capable of cutting men's hair.
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:25.120]   They do a great job.
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.440]   They probably do a better job, for all I know.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.680]   But it destroys the environment.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:33.440]   And then the woman has her female clients and the male clients, and I don't go to the
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.400]   barbershop anymore.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.280]   It's gone.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:40.720]   And so this is what has happened, is that it used to be that men had places to go, and
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.240]   they were respected.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.720]   And then women said, "Men can't have places.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.000]   I got to get in there, because they're going to have a good old boys club, and I'm going
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.560]   to be out."
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.120]   And now men are falling apart, because they don't have places.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:59.680]   And all of everything that was written by Dr. Sacks for girls is every bit as valid
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:00.240]   for men.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:08.240]   Men have to have those environments in order for us, as mature men, to train and correct
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:11.520]   and help facilitate the growth of our boys.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.200]   That's what men do.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:15.120]   Men need that.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:16.800]   And women need it too.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:21.440]   From time to time, I speak in council with single mothers who have sons.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:27.840]   A single mom desperately needs there to exist men's groups, where men in a positive environment
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:31.120]   are going to bring those boys in and bring them in.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.520]   And so this can be done.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.320]   And traditionally, it has been done in positive ways.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.640]   And it can still be done, just not formally.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.560]   So in a church, and I grew up in a church, and we had our church meetings, but then we
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:43.680]   had a men's prayer meeting.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.600]   So once a week, every week, we'd get together very early in the morning, and we'd pray for
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.520]   an hour or two, and then we'd have breakfast together.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.880]   And it was just men.
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:54.400]   And we would have men's leadership meetings and things like that.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.160]   And today, I look back and I realize how important those things are.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:01.040]   They're fundamental to the flourishing of men.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.520]   And they're fundamental to the flourishing of women as well.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.720]   So then your next question.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.760]   What about the men-only clubs, strip clubs, gyms, ball fields, bars, where damage arises
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.920]   from these locations and interactions?
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:16.400]   For example, my husband is prone to over-drinking, yet wants to spend time with guys, and this
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400]   tends towards bars and drinking activity.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.000]   Is this a valuable activity?
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.480]   Well, first of all, I would point out that none of those are men-only clubs.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.440]   A strip club, by definition, is not a men-only club.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.400]   It's a strip club where there are naked women and men.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:36.560]   And then today, as I understand, there are lots of women who go to those as well.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:39.520]   These are obviously leeches on society.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.080]   Any sane and healthy society should obviously eradicate these institutions, and they should
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.040]   be gotten rid of.
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.000]   They're not healthy, they're destructive, and they destroy men.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.920]   Now, gyms or ball fields, where do you find a male-only gym?
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:57.840]   If it could be done legally, I know lots of men who would happily pay double or triple
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:03.280]   to go to a male-only gym, just for the chance to work out without women constantly around,
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.920]   especially in today's scantily clad culture.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:09.920]   Men and fathers want to go to the gym to work out.
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.840]   So it can be achieved a little bit with having a super gritty gym.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.240]   If you find a really, really gritty gym that's just repulsive to women because it's ugly
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:22.960]   and it's dirty and there's concrete and there's rust, then that's one way that men try to
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.640]   create things that repel women.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:27.360]   But most modern gyms, there's no chance.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.520]   They're not a male-only space.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.040]   So I can't even answer the question.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.240]   Bars are not male-only.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.320]   I don't know of a bar that is male-only.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:39.440]   If it were, my guess is there'd probably be – I mean, I don't have any evidence for
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:45.360]   this, let me not go beyond what I can say, but a male-only environment is probably a
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.440]   healthier drinking environment than a mixed-sex bar because men are not trying to drink to
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:55.440]   screw up their courage, to suppress their inhibitions to go and approach that woman.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:57.840]   They don't fall into such nasty things.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:04.320]   I am not in any way saying that men don't have toxic traits and sin that happens in
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.080]   men's cultures.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:11.840]   There's all kinds of bad things that can happen in a male-only environment, but probably
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.680]   not so many as you might think that would happen in an exclusively male-only environment.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.880]   So I'm not arguing for entirely separate lives, but men do need these places.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:29.920]   And what's interesting is that a lot of times the damaging effects are caused by men's
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:31.600]   lack of spiritual development.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:34.720]   So for example, let me give a simple example.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.520]   I grew up in a very mature, very masculine environment.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:47.920]   I have strong relationships and the ability to talk extensively with other men without
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.960]   any problem.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:56.320]   Just for context, one time I drove from Florida to Tennessee to attend a conference and I
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:00.240]   invited my dad along and he just came along just so we could spend the time in the car
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:01.040]   to talk.
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:04.640]   So we drove from West Palm Beach, Florida to Nashville, Tennessee, which I don't remember
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.880]   how long that drive is, but it's a long time.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.640]   And we talked nonstop on the way up.
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.520]   We didn't listen to music.
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:10.640]   We didn't listen to podcasts.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.200]   We talked for whatever it was, 14 hours straight.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:14.800]   And then we attended the conference.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:18.400]   We ate every meal together at the conference and talked there.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.480]   And then we drove home and we talked for 16 hours straight on the way home.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.560]   No problem whatsoever talking.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.680]   I would have no problem with the men that I grew up in, the men in the church.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:31.360]   Most of my relationships saying to people, "Hey, let's go and let's go and talk."
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:38.320]   So for me, saying to someone, "Let's get together for fellowship" is a totally normal
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.920]   thing that I'm happy to do with men.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:40.960]   Let's get together for fellowship.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.480]   We don't need any excuses.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:43.840]   We don't need any crutches.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.640]   I don't need any excuse or crutch to say that.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.280]   There's a lot of men who are very spiritually underdeveloped.
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.120]   They don't have the ability to do that.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.400]   So they need a crutch.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:59:00.960]   And Joshua's theory on coffee, cigars, and alcohol are that these are excuses that men
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:06.160]   use to say to another man, "Hey, let's spend some time together."
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:07.040]   But it's easier.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:11.600]   It takes quite a lot of maturity to say, "Let's go and fellowship for an hour or two."
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:15.200]   It's much easier to say, "Let's have a coffee" or "Let's go and have a drink."
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:18.480]   That's what men are desperate for a lot of times when they go drinking.
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:21.600]   They go to the bar because they're trying to have some conversations.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.000]   And I don't think that these things are necessarily bad things.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.040]   So I don't usually employ the language of, "Let's go fellowship for an hour."
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.160]   I do that with my dad.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:30.560]   But, you know, we'll have a glass of water and sit down.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:33.440]   But I don't say to him, "Let's go and have a beer together."
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.360]   But I do say that to men, "Let's go and have a drink.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.400]   Let's go and have a cigar."
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.280]   Because these are tools that facilitate conversation and fellowship, which is what people are looking
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:41.840]   for.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:47.120]   So what I would say is that if someone is prone to over-drinking, then they shouldn't
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:47.440]   drink.
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.200]   That's a separate conversation.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:54.560]   But there's probably a better chance of getting rid of the drinking by having a good
[01:59:54.560 --> 02:00:01.440]   opportunity for there to be some kind of club that existed, a men's-only club.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.360]   Not a strip club with naked women, but a true men's-only club.
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:09.760]   And if you see where guys do this, again, they do it in a cigar bar or a game lounge
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:11.600]   or a pool hall, something like that.
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:15.040]   The men go there not because they're looking for the alcohol.
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.600]   They're looking for the camaraderie and the companionship.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:20.640]   I hope this is useful.
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:22.640]   I'm investing my time into this because I care.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:24.080]   I hope it's useful to you.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.080]   The next question I'm going to answer more quickly.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:29.520]   "What do you do with your listeners who have no ability to benefit from the teachings
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.560]   that are men-focused?"
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:38.000]   I encourage those listeners to go somewhere else and find something else that is useful.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.520]   That's what you have to do.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:46.000]   What I would say, however, is that even if you are a woman, you will probably learn something
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:55.280]   from what I have to say because I am consciously not filtering myself to appeal to a male/female
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:55.780]   crowd.
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:01:01.520]   I generally try to imagine myself speaking to a man and try to speak the way I would
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:04.080]   speak to men, knowing that women can listen in.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.120]   And that's totally fine.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:12.480]   So what I would say is that you will hear something different from me because I'm trying
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:21.600]   to speak as truthfully and in as non-censored a way as I possibly can, rather than trying
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.640]   to curtail my words to speak to women, which is generally what men will do.
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:30.640]   Men don't enjoy conflict and they don't enjoy conflict with women.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.560]   So what they generally will do is they will censor their speech and the things that they
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:35.680]   say to women.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:37.040]   They won't say what they think.
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.640]   They won't say what they believe.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:42.880]   It's easier to say something patronizing so the woman will leave you alone and then
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:43.920]   resort to silence.
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:48.880]   That's a normal way that men handle women.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:54.560]   So what I would say is you listen and you ask me questions, which is smart, and I'm
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.440]   trying to give you the truth as I best understand it, as best I'm able to.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.000]   Then you say, "What about the male listeners who have daughters?
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.680]   How do you speak to them to help their daughters and be invested in their development?"
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:09.440]   As much as I possibly can, I care about the issues enormously.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.960]   That's why I'm spending time on it.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:18.240]   My observation is we are some—I was going to say much more in tune.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:23.280]   Let me just modify that and say we've spent a lot of time on trying to help our daughters
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:23.760]   flourish.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:30.640]   That's well and good and right, and maybe that corrective action was necessary.
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:31.760]   I'm totally open to that.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:35.280]   Our boys are not flourishing right now.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.200]   They are dying.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.480]   In many cases, literally.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:49.040]   If we want to have a future for our culture and our society and our community, we have
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.240]   a lot of work to do.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.360]   That's why I'm talking about it.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.400]   I care about women enormously.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.400]   I care about the success of women.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:06.560]   I'm particularly burdened that we're not talking to men and about men and their problems.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:10.800]   I am astonished—I'll use just an example, the Andrew Tate phenomenon.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:19.280]   I am astonished at how many women are surprised at the appeal of a man like Andrew Tate.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:24.080]   It should be obvious.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.720]   Any guy like me who's a millennial, grew up in the culture we grew up in,
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.320]   I'm not astonished at all about the appeal of Andrew Tate.
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.320]   I understand the appeal viscerally.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.880]   I'm not astonished at all at the appeal of the Incel movement and the Red Pill people.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.280]   I understand these things very, very viscerally.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:49.440]   I also happen to think that the solutions recommended by these movements are wrong,
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:55.760]   harmful and destructive, and aren't going to produce any good outcomes.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:03.840]   So, if I see that, then I have a responsibility as a man to try to come up to understand the
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:08.800]   problems, to empathize with them, and then try to chart an alternative course that I
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:11.280]   think is healthier, and time and results will prove.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:13.840]   I conclude with the final question.
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:17.040]   What about the young men who damage society in the name of power/vanity?
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:23.200]   Why glorify them in this podcast episode, number 1016?
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.760]   I don't know that I glorified them.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.440]   I'm not sure exactly who you were responding to.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.720]   So, if I glorified somebody who is damaging society in the name of power and vanity,
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.000]   then I apologize for that, because I don't ever wish to glorify people who are damaging
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.800]   society in the name of power and vanity.
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:48.800]   I desire to confront those people and take them down, and I've demonstrated in various
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.760]   ways in my life that I'm committed to do that, even at personal harm.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.720]   So, if I did that, I'm not sure what you're alluding to, then I do apologize for that,
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:58.080]   because I never want to do that.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:02.640]   So, you can tell me how I did that in that particular podcast episode.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:13.920]   However, what I would say is, if you want to have the young men who are damaging society
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:21.040]   in the name of power and vanity controlled, taken out, and put in their place,
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:25.120]   you aren't going to do it.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:28.320]   It's going to be the men who do it.
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:38.960]   I can't think of any example in which that I could draw to bear to say, "Here is how
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.680]   a woman has taken control of young men who are damaging society."
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:54.640]   That difficult and distasteful work can probably only be done by men.
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:59.760]   It will probably be done by men whose wives are bending their ear and making sure they
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:04.320]   see what's happening, and that's the best expression for women, but if you're going
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:08.000]   to take out those young men, it's probably going to be mature men who do that.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:10.640]   To me, that's important.
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:17.680]   So, if you want to have mature men who take out young men who are damaging society, then
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:22.320]   we've got to work really hard on cultivating the young men.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:28.880]   Let me give a very graphic and very sad example of this that kind of demonstrates the destruction
[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:29.440]   that we see.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:35.200]   You asked earlier in your questions, and you said, "Do you want men caring for your
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:35.680]   daughter, wife?"
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.880]   And I answered all those questions.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:38.320]   "Do you want men in positions of risk?"
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:46.000]   I would also say we have a duty to protect women, and when men protect women, it's
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.360]   not because they're always trying to subjugate women.
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.880]   It's because they want to protect women.
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:54.960]   My brother sent me a link to an article yesterday of a story I hadn't heard of previously,
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:55.840]   a horrific story.
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:59.440]   It happened a few years ago in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:11.680]   There was a therapist, a female therapist, who went to the house of a patient of hers
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:14.720]   who she was providing psychiatric treatment for.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:20.480]   This young man, a disturbed young man for whom she was providing psychiatric treatment
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:28.400]   for, kidnapped her, raped her, and tortured her over the duration of a period of about
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:32.880]   12 to 15 hours, something like that, if I've got my facts straight.
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.160]   The police were called to the house.
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:42.560]   There was a catastrophic breakdown of policing procedure because the deputies knocked on
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:49.120]   the house and tried to figure out what was going on, and the man had put up black plastic
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.840]   tablecloths covering the windows so nothing could be seen.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:56.800]   While the police were outside the house, the woman successfully screamed, and they heard
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:01.600]   the scream, and they dealt with the scream, but they went on and on trying to figure out
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:10.160]   whether they should go in, whether they shouldn't go in, and eventually the female therapist
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:17.360]   who was locked in the house, her girlfriend had gotten concerned about her and knew where
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:21.440]   she was and finally convinced the police that her car was in the driveway and they should
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:22.240]   go in.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:24.720]   So they went in the door, they walk in the door.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:28.480]   The guy is standing there with a knife at this woman's throat.
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.880]   One of the police officers shot the guy in the head.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:34.720]   He ultimately survived, later pleaded guilty to all of the charges against him.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:46.320]   A horrific story, but an example to say what kind of sane society would ever approve of
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:52.240]   sending a female psychiatric mental health counselor, therapist, whatever it's called,
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:57.120]   to the house of a mentally disturbed young man.
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:03.920]   I'm glad that the victim's girlfriend followed through and finally convinced the police to
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:05.360]   finally enter the problem.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.400]   I'm grateful for that.
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:16.000]   It's insane that the victim's girlfriend would ever allow her girlfriend to be in a
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.120]   situation like that.
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:22.560]   That is a decisional relationship dynamic that is incomprehensible to me.
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.880]   I would never permit my wife to be in a situation like that.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.080]   I would never permit my daughter to be in a situation like that.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:38.800]   I would go across the world to stop any woman in my life from being in a situation like
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:39.040]   that.
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:46.960]   You recall my earlier discomfort with the idea of a female counselor or psychiatrist.
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:50.000]   There's probably many great ones out there.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:58.720]   This one, however, for a counselor to show that lack of judgment is incomprehensible
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:09:59.120]   to me.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:04.000]   I hope that she's able to recover from her injuries.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:11.520]   I wish deeply for justice to be done to the evil man who has harmed her.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:20.720]   He is in no way to be his crime and his evil is in no way made less evil because of her
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:21.840]   poor decision making.
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.520]   I wish for him to be executed for his crime.
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:30.720]   My point is simply we play with cultural norms at our peril.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:36.640]   And when we change them, we had better understand what we're doing and why we're doing it.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:45.760]   And a culture that ultimately sends a female mental health counselor unaccompanied to the
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:51.840]   house of a mentally disturbed young man is a culture that does not wish to continue to
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:52.080]   live.
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:57.120]   It's a culture that has already agreed to its own end and it's just a matter of time.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:01.600]   That's the flip side.
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:07.360]   That's the flip side.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.400]   And right now we're in an extreme counter-reaction scenario.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:19.040]   Men have pretty well lost their will to protect women at the moment, speaking broadly.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.880]   Not all.
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:22.160]   Not in all circumstances.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.080]   Society has lost its will to protect women.
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.000]   There are probably no easy answers.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.800]   I mean, let me say that with more confidence.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:34.960]   There are no easy answers in this.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:37.840]   There are opportunities for abuse on all sides.
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:40.080]   There are opportunities for abuse towards men, towards women.
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:47.840]   We cannot let the extreme factions of our society be the ones to say, to control the
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.120]   dominant narrative.
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:58.720]   Thoughtful, intelligent men and women like you and me, we are the ones who need to be
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:06.400]   talking about these things soberly, openly, forthrightly, bristling our way through the
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:13.120]   arrows of the internet if we want our societies to succeed and to flourish.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.840]   We all want our boys and our girls to flourish.
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:22.080]   They're not flourishing at the moment and we got to figure out why.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:26.480]   We can't just accept the fact that probably the top 20% are going to flourish no matter
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:33.760]   what, we need to focus on that middle 60% that we can save, that we can improve with
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:36.080]   a strong, rational society.
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:38.560]   I don't pretend to have all the answers.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.320]   Those are my answers to your questions.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.960]   Don't argue against a straw man.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:50.560]   A man who says that women should be honored and appreciated for their contributions as
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:55.600]   mothers and their contributions in the home is not saying anything more than that.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:01.600]   Don't fight against the straw man that somehow a guy who says that is saying that he wants
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:03.600]   women to be ignorant and not know how to read.
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:04.800]   That's another culture.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:05.920]   That's not mine.
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:12.480]   I would like to end that culture, but I would like to not replace it with the culture that
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:20.720]   has countless TikTok videos of women crying unconsolably because of the nightmare that
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.080]   they're living through with their own unrequited hopes and dreams.
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:29.920]   We can do better, and I hope that we can figure out some new pathways in the future to deal
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.520]   with, be appreciative for all the problems in the past that our cultures and societies
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.600]   have solved, but let's solve the ones that are facing us in the face today.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:40.560]   Thank you for your email and for your questions.
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.800]   I hope that I have answered them clearly and directly, and I hope that there's something
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.280]   useful to you in them, in my answers.
