[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760]   Jesus told us to bind and loose, but is this practice relevant for the church today?
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.240]   Pastor John joins us over Skype to address this question from a listener named Joe.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.640]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.280]   Jesus told the disciples that whatever they bind or loose on earth would be so in heaven.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.240]   The church has the keys to the kingdom of heaven, meaning whatever you bind on earth
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.760]   shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640]   Matthew 16, verse 19.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.440]   So what can a local church bind and loose and what could me and a Christian friend bind
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   and loose?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.080]   Does this text have any relevant application to the church today?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.080]   Yes.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.080]   The answer is yes, it's relevant.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.680]   It is relevant for today.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.480]   It's always been relevant in every age of the church.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.480]   It's relevant.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:01.400]   But yes, Joe, if you are a true follower of Jesus, you and your friend is a true follower
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.400]   of Jesus can bind and loose in the way that Jesus means it here.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.600]   So let's read it, make sure we get the whole context, and then I'll try to explain what
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.760]   I think it means and how it's relevant.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.960]   Jesus said to his disciples, I'm reading Matthew 16, verses 16 to 19.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.440]   Jesus said to his disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.480]   Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.680]   And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.000]   revealed that to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.720]   And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.840]   of hell shall not prevail against it.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.920]   I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.120]   be bound in heaven.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.240]   Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.600]   So Jesus asked the disciples who they believe he is.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.960]   He's getting at the core issue of discipleship, the identity of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.600]   Whatever else Jesus teaches, if they don't get this right, they don't get anything right.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.120]   It will all be distorted if it's not built on this central bedrock of Jesus teaching
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.040]   who he is.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800]   So Peter answers correctly.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   You are the Christ, the Messiah.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.640]   The Son of the living God.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   You're the Messiah.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.560]   Not just any ordinary human Messiah, but the unique, divine Son of God.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.640]   And then Jesus makes clear that Peter did not come up with this on his own.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.680]   Flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:14.600]   In other words, this central bedrock core of Jesus teaching, namely his true reality,
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.560]   is a work of God in the mind of Peter, not a work of man, and therefore he calls Peter
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   blessed.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.960]   You're blessed because God has given you this insight.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:36.720]   Then Jesus makes a play on words because Peter's name, Petras, means rock or stone.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   So Jesus says, "You are Petras, and on this rock, Petra, this bedrock," they're not the
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.920]   same words, I'll come back to that.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   They're almost the same.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   There's a word play, not another word identity.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.840]   You are Petras, and on this Petra, you are a rock, and on this bedrock, I'll build my
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800]   church and the gates of hell so not prevail against it.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.080]   Now before we jump to the conclusion that Peter alone here is made the foundation of
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.360]   the church, notice three things.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   Number one, Jesus did not say, "On you I will build my church," which he very easily could
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   have said.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.000]   He said instead, "On this bedrock, Petra, I will build my church."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.160]   Second, even though Jesus says to Peter, "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.240]   whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   be loosed in heaven," that very same thing Jesus says to Christians in general with the
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.160]   very same words in Matthew 18, two chapters later.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.400]   Verse 18, "Truly I say to you," plural, not you, Peter, you plural, "you who are gathered
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.480]   in my name, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, whatever you loose
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.640]   on earth shall have been loosed in heaven," Matthew 18, 18.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   That's the second observation.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.160]   Here's the third.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.720]   Jesus does not say, "You are Petras, and on this Petras, I will build my church."
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.400]   He says, "You are Petras, and on this Petra, I will build my church."
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.200]   Petra has a different connotation than Petras.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.480]   It's not a loose stone.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.360]   It's bedrock stone.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360]   Here's what I mean.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:36.120]   In Matthew 27, 60, where it says that Jesus' tomb was cut out of the Petra, the bedrock,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.360]   that doesn't mean it was cut out of a loose stone.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   Like here's a stone.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.280]   It's maybe weighs 10 pounds.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.760]   It's found on the side of the road, and he cut a grave in that stone.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.440]   Well, that doesn't work.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.280]   What he means is the side of this mountain is stone.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   Like this is a massive bedrock where you'd build something, and so you carve into this
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.360]   bedrock a grave.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.280]   That's the connotation of Petra.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.360]   It's not a loose stone like Petras.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.880]   Petra is bedrock.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.440]   The same word is used in Matthew 7, 24.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.560]   Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.280]   built his house on this bedrock.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:31.640]   Not a pile of stones, not gravel, but the bedrock ground in the side of the mountain
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.400]   that you dig down to until you got a good foundation.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.620]   The bedrock is solid, permanent.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.280]   It's the teachings of Jesus, which he says can never pass away.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.600]   My understanding in view of those three observations is that the bedrock on which the church is
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:07:00.340]   built is the bedrock of Jesus' teachings with the rock-solid core of his identity.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.960]   You are the Messiah.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.520]   You are the Son of God at the center of those teachings.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:14.320]   Since Peter is the one who made that confession in this case, he's treated as the representative
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.100]   of all those who would faithfully lift up the teachings of Jesus and the word of Jesus
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:29.360]   with the true reality of who he is at the center or as the bedrock of the church.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.240]   So it's these teachings of Jesus that are the keys of the kingdom.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.280]   He says, "I give you the key," or the keys of the kingdom, which means that when you
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:46.600]   speak, Peter, or according to Matthew 18, any faithful Christian who speaks the words
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.340]   with the bedrock of Jesus' identity at the center, when you speak those words faithfully,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:02.560]   you are using the keys of the kingdom to open the kingdom in people's lives.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.720]   There's a clue that I think confirms we're on the right track from Luke 11, 52.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:16.240]   "Woe to you, lawyers," Jesus said, "for you have taken away the key of knowledge.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:24.080]   You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering."
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   This is the key of the kingdom, the key of knowledge, the key of the teachings of Jesus
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   with the reality of Jesus himself at the center.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.400]   That knowledge, that faithful proclamation of the word of Christ with Christ's identity
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.560]   at the center, truly taught, opens the kingdom to people's lives.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.840]   That knowledge, withheld or distorted, closes the kingdom to people.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.480]   When Jesus says, "Whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven," which is
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:07.320]   the right, future-perfect translation of the verb tense, "Whatever you bind on earth shall
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.120]   have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven,"
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:21.140]   he means that in all of this human key-turning, turning of the keys of the knowledge of God,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.640]   we are doing what God has decided should come to pass.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.120]   Our teaching is essential; God's will is decisive.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.120]   So Joe, you and your friend, and I would say all faithful Christians, can take your stand,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:46.680]   and you should take your stand, on the bedrock of Jesus' word with Jesus himself, his reality
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.960]   at the center, and speak it.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:57.400]   And in so doing, you will turn the key of heaven in people's lives and open the kingdom
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   to them.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.000]   And Joe, thank you for the question, and thanks for listening.

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.200]   We have another important Bible question up next time.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.820]   Does the coming of the Mosaic law into history actually empower our sin nature?
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.760]   Does it make our sin stronger?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.640]   Seems like that's the case in the New Testament.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.280]   And that is our next question up on Monday.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.960]   We'll see you then.
