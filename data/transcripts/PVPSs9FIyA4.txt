[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   - All right, Jesse, I think we have time
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.840]   for one last question.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.480]   So let's see what we have here.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.120]   - All right, the last question is a new father
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.600]   and he's got some questions about managing that
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   and doing some deep work.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Judd
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   and I'm a long time fan of your work.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.460]   In a recent podcast, you said nothing has negatively impacted
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.520]   your productivity as much as being a new parent.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   I'm a father of two children under the age of two
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.840]   and I'm experiencing the same thing.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600]   Do you have any tips for parents of babies
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.440]   to help navigate the challenges of being a new parent?
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.960]   While I love being a father,
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.320]   the sleepless nights and near constant attention
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080]   the girls require have seriously reduced my ability
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.280]   to do deep work.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280]   They've also killed my creativity and ability
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.540]   to come up with Greek mythological references,
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.040]   for which I apologize.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.880]   Thanks so much.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.460]   I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.960]   - Well, I mean, I think in order to reprioritize
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.880]   mythological references,
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.280]   toddler boarding school is what we need.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280]   Where you send off your daughters,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.100]   they'll come back for the summers and for the holidays,
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.480]   and then you can really focus
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.320]   on good mythological references.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.380]   No, Judd, I think it is, there are seasons.
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380]   And there's a big idea from slow productivity,
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560]   seasonality at multiple scales,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.640]   from the week to the month,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.480]   to the years, to multiple years.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.680]   Two young kids under two,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.960]   this is a season in which you're not
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.360]   writing the great American novel.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760]   I think that's okay.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.500]   Life is long.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.360]   You have babies.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.600]   It's batting down the hatches time.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.880]   Now I had seasons like that,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.720]   obviously with young kids,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480]   I had a season, I think the pandemic
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.160]   caused some seasonality for me.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   Our schools were closed, there's chaos,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.240]   and I had to pull back on a lot of things.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.320]   And in the grand scheme of things,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.900]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.060]   That was a slow season.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.360]   Different seasons are different.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   I mean, when my kids finally all go off to college,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   I know exactly how old I'll be when that happens.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.760]   We've done this math, trust me.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.360]   I'm either going to explode into a frenzy
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.480]   of productive output.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.960]   I'll be writing three books a year,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   or I'll just die.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.780]   It'll be one of the two.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.680]   I'll either just be at the end of the finish line and die,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   or I'm gonna be writing three books a year or something.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.720]   And I see different seasons are different.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.980]   So first of all, I just wanna give you that,
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.560]   I wanna give you that reassurance.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.980]   I think it's fine to slow down.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.620]   And this is a very important thing in your life.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.080]   Give it some focus.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.800]   Now, keep a handle on the other things.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.080]   You don't want the work you have to do
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.640]   to become a major source of stress right now.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.460]   So go watch my core ideas video on time management,
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.040]   for example, and make sure that you have
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.720]   a ship shape organizational system
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.520]   so that you have the breathing room necessary
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.120]   to not work so much and not have it be a crisis.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.540]   The only other advice I'll give,
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.400]   and I gotta be wary about giving parenting advice.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.480]   I get yelled at a lot, but I gotta tell you, sleep training.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.340]   And don't yell at me, anti-sleep training people,
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.780]   but you've got two kids, you guys both work,
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.340]   you gotta do sleep training, right?
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940]   I'm very trepidatious.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220]   Jesse can say I look very trepidatious
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.740]   because the parenting advice gets you in a lot of trouble.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.260]   If your strategy is just, I think eventually
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.540]   the kid will figure it out and start sleeping,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.620]   they will torture your soul.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.460]   And they'll fake you out and they'll start sleeping more.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.980]   And then you'll all be high-fiving
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.300]   and telling your friends how good you are,
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.780]   like your kids are good sleepers.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.700]   And then they'll just twist a knife
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.480]   and start getting up at four and getting up at two
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.500]   and getting up at nine.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.820]   And so this was my wife and I's survival strategy
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.700]   is we're doing a lot for these kids,
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.380]   but these kids need to do one thing for us,
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.540]   and that is they're gonna have to go
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.420]   through some sleep training.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.380]   So don't put up with four years of not sleeping.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.140]   A lot of people do.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.820]   You could make that four months
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.940]   if you're willing to think about sleep training.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.420]   Any complaints about that, that always upsets parents.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.260]   So you can send all your complaints
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.260]   to jesse@calnewport.com and really, really let me have it,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.580]   but send those to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.580]   All right, Judd, well, good luck and congratulations.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.980]   And yeah, go easy on yourself
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.580]   and look into sleep training.
