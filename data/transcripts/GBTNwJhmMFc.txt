[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   All right. Hey, can you introduce yourself? Yes, sure. My name is Kenechukwu Onwe, but
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.360]   Kene for short. Originally from Nigeria, but currently a student at the seminary,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.440]   Master's Seminary. All right, and you've been using the LSB. What do you think?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.400]   The LSB has become a gem, actually. I was considering getting one last year. I
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.920]   ended up being gifted one, and it's been good. It's become my primary
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.600]   preaching Bible, and I got to say my favorite thing about it is not only
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.680]   having enough margin, but I decide to scribble, but also I love that the
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.040]   references are in caps, because then I know that this is pulled from somewhere.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.080]   The biblical author is pulled from somewhere to make the argument. So yeah,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.200]   it's a helpful tool. It is very helpful. All right, great. Thanks for stopping by.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.280]   Thank you. That's perfect.
