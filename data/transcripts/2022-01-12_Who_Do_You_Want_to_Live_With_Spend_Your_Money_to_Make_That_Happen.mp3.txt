[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I'm your host.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Today on the show, I want to share with you
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   some of the building blocks
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   of a good, rock-solid financial plan,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   but I would bet that they're not what you think they are.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   See, for many years, I worked as a financial planner,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   which means that I talked to people about their money,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   and we talked about their financial goals.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And what I learned in that process
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   of sitting face-to-face with hundreds and hundreds
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   of people talking about their money
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   is that frequently, the goals that we have with money
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   are disconnected from the actual goals that we have.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   See, we sit down and we say,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   "I want to have a certain amount of money.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   "I want to have an amount of savings in the bank.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   "I want to have an income of a certain amount."
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But we don't stop and think about
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   why we want to actually have that money.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I want you to imagine something.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Imagine that you set a financial goal.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I want to have a million dollars.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I want you to picture what a million dollars
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   of physical cash looks like, physical bank notes.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   If you're having trouble picturing exactly how big that is,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   let me give you a couple of mental images to help you.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Let's assume that you're going to do this with $1 bills.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   A million dollars of $1 bills would create a cube
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   of about 4 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So picture a pallet, an ordinary pallet,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   which is 48 inches by 48 inches,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   stacked up about 48 inches tall with $1 bills.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Or if you prefer your currency in $100 bills,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   you could fit a million dollars
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   in a relatively modest-sized briefcase.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I think it's like 43 inches tall.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   If you were going to stack it all up,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   take them out and set them beside each other,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   then you can fit it into a briefcase.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But I like the idea of a pallet of $1 bills.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So picture in your storeroom, your pantry,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   your garage, somewhere like that,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   you sit down and you put a pallet on the floor
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and you start stacking $1 bills.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And you stack and you stack and you stack and you stack
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   until you reach a pile that's a 4-foot cube.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Now you have a million dollars.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You've achieved your financial goal.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So here's my question.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Now what?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Now what?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Maybe your goal is $10 million.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Okay, put 10 of those in your garage
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and assume that you've achieved that.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Now what? Now what are you going to do?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   When you start to think about this,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   you realize that the only point
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   of establishing a monetary goal
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   that can be measured with numbers
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   is to actually use that money
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   to accomplish something,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   to achieve something that's important to you.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So what are you likely to want to accomplish
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   when you have achieved your monetary goal?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Now some people's vision
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   of what they want to accomplish is to
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   sit on the beach and do nothing all day.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That's fair.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Lots of people enjoy sitting on the beach
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and doing nothing all day.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   In my experience, the kind of people
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   who want to do that for the long term
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   aren't usually the same kind of people
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   who actually accumulate any significant amounts of money.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   If you want to sit on the beach and do nothing all day,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   you can find millions of people
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   all around the world doing that on a daily basis,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   living day to day, hand to mouth,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   making just enough to fill their bellies
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   with some food and sit on the beach
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and do nothing all day.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So you don't actually need a million dollars to do that.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Sometimes people say, "I want to travel the world,"
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   or, "I want to take that stack of a million dollars
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and turn it into a beautiful house."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And these are all fair goals,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   but I want you to really think about it.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Put it into a physical sense.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Imagine those pallets of bills sitting in your pantry.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What are you actually going to do with them?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Over the years, I've gone through these exercises myself,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   as I've worked through them with individuals,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I've found again and again
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   that there are a few common themes.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And I want to expand those themes
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   because I believe that if you understand
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   what those themes are,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   then you will be able to do a better job
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of spending your money in a satisfying way.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Today I want to begin with one of what I call the big three.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   These are the big three questions,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   the big three decisions that you will want to make
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   before you engage in any hardcore,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   numbers on the paper, financial planning.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The first question for you to answer is this.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Who do I want to live with?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Who do I want to be present in my life?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   What are the people, who are the people
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   that I want to be surrounded with in my day-to-day life?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   This is the first question for you to consider.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   If you're a particularly dedicated student,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I'd encourage you to take a moment
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   and write it down on a piece of paper.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Put this into your journal.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Open a note on your phone
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and start writing down the kinds of people
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   or the specific people that you want to be involved in your life.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Make a note of the people that you want in your life.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Because I believe that one of the best uses of money,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and in fact, one of the first sets of decisions
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   that you should make before you even think about
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   the rest of your money is,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   who do you want in your life?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And in the rest of this show,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I'm going to give you various expanding ideas,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   expanding questions, expanding examples
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   to expand on this theme of things
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   that you might want to consider.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   We begin with those people that are
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   the most intimate in your life.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   For most of us, the most intimate people
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   would involve some form of a romantic partner.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And I would encourage you that
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   this is one of the decisions
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   that will make the biggest difference in your life.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Meeting somebody that you want to spend your life with,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   maintaining a good relationship with the right person,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   the kind of person that builds you up,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   the kind of person that complements you
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   in your uniqueness.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   This practice of meeting and maintaining
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   a high-quality relationship with a romantic partner
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   is bar none one of the most important
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   and best decisions that you can possibly make.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So let me begin first
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   to those who do not yet have
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   an appropriate romantic partner.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I want to encourage you that it's perfectly fine,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and in fact, I advise it, for you to put it down
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   as an actual goal,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   an actual thing that you want to accomplish.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And to pursue this with focus.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   There are a few ideas when it comes to
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   finding and attracting a suitable spouse.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   There are a few ideas that people often take to extremes
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   where they ought not to go.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   For example, there is an idea that
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   you should be whole in and of yourself.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   You should be a whole person.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And that you shouldn't come to a romantic relationship
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   expecting your partner to
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   make you more than you are,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   or to fill in your gaps, etc.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Is this true? I think it is true.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That you should be a whole and independent person.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And you don't want to expect your partner
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   to try to fill in some weakness that you have.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   But that doesn't mean that you're not going to be expanded,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   that your capabilities are not going to be expanded,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   that you're not going to have a more satisfying life and lifestyle
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   if you can find and attract an appropriate partner.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   One of the marks of a good relationship is often that there's synergy.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   One plus one is something more than two.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And if that's the case, then you're better off
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   first quickly becoming a whole person,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and then as quickly as possible
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   attracting an appropriate spouse.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   So, could you or should you spend money on making that happen?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Sometimes yes and sometimes no.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   But here I would encourage you that if you are unmarried
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   and you desire to be married,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   or if you're looking for simply a romantic partner,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   ask yourself if you can't spend a little bit of money
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   to improve that process.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Ask yourself if you shouldn't spend a little bit of money
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   to improve that process.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's funny, I think sometimes I find myself being the guy,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   kind of the anti-frugality guy,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   frequently telling people, "Listen,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   why are you saving so much money and neglecting something
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   that is also important to you?"
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I frequently find myself talking to people and saying,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   "How nice of a car are you driving?"
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Like it or not, people judge you by the car that you drive.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   "Do you dress well?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Like it or not, people judge you by the way that you dress.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "Are you involved in activities that are going to be appropriate
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   to helping you establish and expand your social circles?"
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   These things often cost money, but they are good uses of money.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Spending money on dates,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   spending money on going to places where you can find dates,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   these are good uses of money.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And then if you desire to marry,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   spending money on getting married,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   whatever that entails, is a good use of money.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   If you're thoughtful and careful,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   this can be some of the best money that you spend.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   What about people who are already married
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   or already in some sort of romantic relationship?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Well, in this case, I think some of the best money that you spend
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   is making sure that your marriage has the things around it
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   that will put the best probability of it thriving.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You should be happy to spend money on strengthening your marriage.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   That could mean everything from living in a certain place,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   living in a certain style of life,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   living in a certain home.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It could mean things like prioritizing the cost of a babysitter
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   so you can go out on date night
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   or arranging quarterly weekend getaways,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   whatever those things are that are appropriate for you.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Spend money on your marriage.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   This should be a high priority.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Spend money on your marriage.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I always love the turn of phrase that Zig Ziglar had years ago.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   He called it courtship after marriage.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Strangely, marriage is one of those things
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   where I very rarely have to tell someone to,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "Hey, go ahead, spend money on someone you're seeking to attract
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   into a marriage relationship."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   But then all of a sudden, the date nights get cut out,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   the fun gets cut out,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and we wonder why the relationships lose their spark.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   If you can spend money
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and improve the quality of your intimate relationships, do so.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   That's a good use of money.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Now let's expand out.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   The next most intimate relationships that we have
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   usually involve those relationships with our children.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   As people grow, especially as parents age,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   they often find themselves wanting very much
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   deep, high-quality relationships with their children.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I believe that some of the best money that you can spend
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   is on cultivating the relationships that you have with your children.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   This begins in the very decision to have children.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   There is a strong, strong antenatal trend in our societies.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   This last year in the United States,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   the lowest birth rate in recorded history.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The lowest birth rate in recorded history.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And when you ask people why,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   frequently they list financial concerns
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   as one reason why they don't want to have children.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   When you study what people say about not having children,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   they say, "I just don't feel like I'm prepared.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I just don't feel like I'm ready."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And often they cite finances as a component of that.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   There's no question that children place new pressures on your finances.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   They place pressures that are very, very strong,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and those pressures come at you in many, many ways.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And yet it's one of the strangest trends of our time,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   the fact that there's often more money available to you and to me in our lives
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   than at any point in human history.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And there's more money available to us for our children
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   than at any point in human history.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And yet as the richest generation in the history of the world,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   we find ourselves looking around and saying,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   "I can't afford to have children."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I personally don't believe in the concept of waiting to be married
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   until you can "afford" it,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   and I personally don't believe in the concept of waiting to have children
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   until you can "afford" it.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   There is a balance.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I, of course, would advise many people and say,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   "Why don't you establish yourself before getting married?"
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I would tell people often, "Why don't you work extra
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   so you're not living hand-to-mouth before you add more mouths to the table?"
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But those changes should be very, very short,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and at least 80% of the time,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   the people who are worried about it
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   are the ones who don't have anything to worry about in the first place.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   The money that you spend on your children
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   will often be some of the highest payoff money that you'll ever be able to spend.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   The money that you spend on the actual care of your children,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   the things that your children need,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   many people find that as they age, they're so grateful they've done it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Very frequently, when you talk to an older, wealthy person,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   you will find that most of their care, most of their attention,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   most of their time is oriented around
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   things that they want to do with their children and their grandchildren.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   This is natural and normal,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   but if you know that you're going to end up there,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   then put in the time now, spend the money now to get the best results that you can.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I can't tell you exactly how to spend that money.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   That's up to you,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   but I do know that it's some of the best money that you can spend.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   If your children are older, out of your house,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   make sure that you live appropriately close to them,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   or in an appropriate way,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   you've gotten the best relationship that's possible for you.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Some of the best money that you can spend is
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   in enhancing and developing the relationships that you can have with your children.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   That money might be spent in moving to another city or buying a place in another city
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   so you can regularly visit your children.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It might be spent in simply going closer to where they are.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It might be spent in a vacation home where you can invite your children to be with you.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   But being together with your children is a great use of money,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and very rarely will you ever make a mistake when you spend money
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   on being appropriately close to those that you love.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   What about your parents?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   One of the best things that you can do to improve your general sense of happiness and satisfaction
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   is live at an appropriate distance to your parents.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Sometimes this means as close as possible, right next door.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Sometimes this means farther away than where you are right now.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Think carefully about where you'd like to live with regard to your parents,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and prioritize living there as a really good use of your money.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Make sure that if you want to be closer, you're closer.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Whether that means you move mom and dad closer to you,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   or you move closer to mom and dad, or arrange some third option, do it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   If you need to be farther away, do it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   If you need to limit their influence, do it.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   If you need to encourage their influence, do it.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Prioritize with your money the relationships that are most important to you.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Let's move on. What about your circle of intimate friends?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Your circle of intimate friends can be one of the most powerful influences on your life.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   This is something that's worthy of your attention, your time,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and to the extent you're capable of it, money.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Attention and time are usually the things that are the most necessary.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Friendships require cultivation. They require time.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   They require effort for you to arrange those circumstances.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   When you ask many people what's the time in their life that they enjoy the most,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   frequently they will hearken back to some form of college experience.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I don't think that in the main this is because they were drunk all the time.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I think this has more to do with the social environment in which they lived.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   If you think about college, it's a time of intense socialization.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Yes, there are certain demands on our time.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   We're required to work, we're required to study, etc.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Those demands are modest in the main,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   but more importantly we're often together with other people
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and we can filter and sort ourselves to be with people that we like.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Our schedules are unencumbered by other obligations.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Therefore, we can engage in all kinds of planned and spontaneous social events.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   That intense socialization leads to some of the happiest memories of our life.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Frequently we don't have a lot of money.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Our car might be broken down.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   We might take trips on a shoestring crammed all in one tiny little junkie car
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   to go away for spring break.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   We might do some wacky adventures, go hitchhiking across the country, etc.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   But that socialization, that focus on enjoying relationships with other people
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   can be very pleasurable.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Then we go and get involved in the more normal adult life
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   and there tends to come this intense social isolation.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Instead of being together with other people, we wind up more separate from them.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   The friends that we once had based upon affinity
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   are often replaced by friendships that come from we work together, coworkers.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   "Hey, let's go out and grab a drink because we've been working late
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   and because we're coworkers."
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Those people that we really like, we mean to get around to calling them.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   We mean to get around to seeing them.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And yet, unhappily, it often doesn't happen quite so much as we would like.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   This can be changed though with attention.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   You can emphasize to yourself the importance of your friends
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   and then you can start to focus on cultivating those relationships.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   If you don't have a base of any friends to start with,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   you can start by focusing on making some new friends.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   If you have some old friends,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   then focus on bringing yourself together with those friends.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   This may mean Thursday night poker.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   This may mean Saturday afternoon barbecues.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   This may mean barbecues at the park where the children can come along
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and where they can be entertained so you can actually hang out with your friends.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   This might mean an annual retreat,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   going ahead and renting the nice ski cabin
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   so that everyone can get together and be together for an enjoyable experience.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But these things are worth spending money on.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   These things make life worth living.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It might mean flying across the country to surprise someone,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   spend a day with them.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It might mean, I would say, the cost of contacting someone,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   but in our day and age it doesn't cost anything more other than time
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and attention to pick up the phone and call somebody.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Prioritize time and togetherness with your friends
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   and make sure that you're with the people that you like.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Let's expand outward.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   What about neighbors?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I think one of the best things you can do is spend your money
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   to build around yourself neighbors that you like.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Finding people who reflect your values,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   finding people who reflect your ideas, your ideology,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   that look at the world through a lens similar to yours.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Perhaps there's a danger in surrounding yourself
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   with too much of an insular experience
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   where all your neighbors just think exactly like you do.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It's good to have a little variety.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   But if you don't like your neighbors,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   you might want to consider changing them
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and moving somewhere where you have more in common with people around you.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   It might mean moving from the country to the city.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It might mean moving from the city to the country,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   from the left coast to the right coast to the middle of the country.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Wherever it is that you feel comfortable,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   do your best to surround yourself with the kind of people
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   that make you feel comfortable,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   that will add significantly to the quality of your life.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Next, coworkers.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Think carefully about your coworkers and your work environment.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   You're going to spend a significant amount of time with your coworkers,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   perhaps more than anything else that you're doing in your life.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Your coworkers will be an ever-present reality.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Make sure that you like them.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Make sure that they're the kind of people that you want to be around,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   that you want to emulate.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Because if they are,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   that can be a tremendous, tremendous source of joy and happiness in your life.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You might be able to spend some money on this.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It might cost you a little bit to look for a new job.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   It might cost you a little bit to move for a new job
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   or to replace a set of toxic coworkers with another set.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   But being surrounded by coworkers that you like
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   will make a major, major quality of life improvement for you.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   So focus on it.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Be in the kind of environment that's a good fit for you.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   If a wild, scrappy entrepreneurial startup is for you, get there.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   If a staid, laid-back, conservative company is for you, get there.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   If riding on the open range is for you, get there.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   If being in the middle of the city is right for you, get there.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And you can expand outward from there,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   thinking of all of the other people that are in your life or that can be in your life.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   But focusing yourself on people and being willing to spend money on people,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   this is some of the best money that you'll spend.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I want to use two extreme examples to clarify why I think this is a useful thing to do.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I know that these are caricatures,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   but I believe that sometimes extremes or caricatures can be useful
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   to help illustrate a concept.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I want you to imagine, first of all, our wealthy miser.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Our wealthy miser is somebody who works, works, works, spends nothing, lives in a shack,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   never has time for other people, never spends money on other people.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   It's someone who is not surrounded by love but is surrounded by money,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   sits at home stacking up his gold coins,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   filling up his mason jars and sticking them in the ground.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   This is our wealthy miser.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   He doesn't have a lot of room for people in his life
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   because he's focused on working and saving and making money and making money.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Yes, he's got some parents somewhere that he once knew.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   He's got an estranged sister somewhere.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   He has a divorced wife somewhere that he doesn't keep in contact with.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   He's got a couple of estranged children that he doesn't have any relationship with,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   but he's got plenty of money, and he sits and counts his money all day long.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Now, imagine our other caricature, that of the joyful socialite.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   The joyful socialite is surrounded by family and friends that love him and that he loves.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   He's got a loving wife with a rich, close relationship,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   the kind of people that make you feel weird because they touch each other all the time,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   and they just seem so happy together.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   He's got a house full of children, and, well, of course, his children aren't perfect.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   But he enjoys being with them.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   He enjoys the hustle and bustle and enjoys seeing their success.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   He prioritizes his friends.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   At least once a night, there's another family in his home for dinner.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Weekends, there's people in his backyard.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Once a quarter, he schedules a trip with his buddies.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Once a year, an annual reunion with his college friends.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Regularly, he's with his parents.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Regularly, he spends time to invest in other people.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   He spends time with his friends everywhere.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   His co-workers love him and respect him.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   His neighbors appreciate him.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   They even take advantage of him sometimes.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   They take his tools and don't return them.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But he's not worried about it because he knows he's got relationships with them.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   I want you to imagine both of those men at 65 years old.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The miser has plenty of money, but his relationships are suffered.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   The rich social life has spent all his money on his friends.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   He's got no money, but he's got lots of friends.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Imagine that both of them are diagnosed with terminal cancer and they're given five years to live.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Which of those men would you rather be?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Which of those men do you think would be able to reflect with greater satisfaction on his life?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   If you had to choose between them, which of those would you choose?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   The good news is you don't have to choose between them.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   They're caricatures.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   They're unrealistic.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You can have a strong social life and also accumulate money.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   You can have money and also accumulate friends.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   But to the extent that you can spend money on rich, fulfilling relationships,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I believe that's some of the best money that you can spend.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And if you had to choose between them, I think you'd be more satisfied
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   by having a life full of the people that you love
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   than by having a life full of gold coins or full crypto wallets.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Whatever monetary token you wish to refer to.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Life is but a vapor.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Here today, gone tomorrow.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And the stuff of life, the richest, most rewarding stuff of life,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   comes from our relationships one with another.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   As you consider what you wish to do with your money in the coming year,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   ask yourself, "How much of my money am I spending on others?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   How much of my money am I spending on the relationships that are important to me?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   How much of my money am I spending on people?"
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Reflect carefully on it and make sure that you're happy with the amount.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And if the number is the wrong number for you,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   don't wait to be rich to change.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Just change.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Spending money to get yourself surrounded by the people that you want in your life
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   is the best money that you can spend.
