[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We get a lot of questions and emails about anxiety disorders and ADD, attention deficit disorder.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   One listener asks if ADD is simply a mental disorder or is there sin mixed in here?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And last time in episode 281, you addressed anxiety, but you wanted to save ADD for a whole 'nother episode,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   so let's talk about that today. What would you say about this disorder?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   The first thing I'd say, I'm thinking back now that what I said in the last podcast about anxiety
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and the use of natural strategies as well as spiritual strategies to both cope and flourish in our own limitations,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   that applies here big time as well. Let's start with the definition.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   This is really big, and I have some exposure to it personally, and I've read some about it,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   so this is my best shot. I'm not an expert in ADD, but here's what I understand it to be.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   ADD, attention deficit disorder, goes by other names as well, sometimes ADHD,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   is a brain configuration that presents unusual challenges because of a combination of deficient focus and hyperfocus.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   In other words, adults, there are whole books on adult ADD as well as children.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We usually think of it as kids, you know, acting out in school and certainly,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   a brain condition that may focus intensely on one thing for hours and be utterly oblivious of a whole bunch of other things.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So there's a combination of hyperfocus and deficient focus, and I would say this condition in the brain,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and I suspect it is physiological, I don't know how all that works in terms of the way the brain is patterned over time
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   as a child, but yes, dimensions of physical shaping in the brain has all the marks of the fall,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   like all of our brains, and their deficiencies. I mean, you can think of all kinds of conditions
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   that are physically affected by the nature of the brain, and that's because the brain is affected by the fall,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and yet, I would say that a structurally different brain is not an act of sin.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So that's the question sometimes, is it a sin to be ADD? And I'm saying no, but like all brains,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   the ADD brain will be prone to sin in certain ways. That's the way to think about it.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And so, like all of us, John Piper is prone to sin in certain ways, that Tony Ranke is not prone to sin,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   because the way my genetic makeup, my background, inclines me to struggle with certain things
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   that you don't struggle with and vice versa. The saint with ADD, I like the sound of that,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   the saint, yes, the saint with ADD will need the grace and humility, it seems to me, to take steps
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   to fight the peculiar ways that ADD inclines him or her to sin. For example, it's not a sin, I don't think,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   to forget a task or to fail to see clutter. But it is a sin when wise and loving people give suggestions
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   to how you might compensate for a weakness, and your pride or your self-sufficiency rejects them.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   This is the interplay between the soul and the brain. This is where the gospel of Jesus is always relevant
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   to our physical conditions. The gospel may not change the structure of the brain, but it will humble the heart
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   to be receptive to counsel and practical help that God has provided in the body of Christ
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and in the natural resources of the world. So the spiritual transformation of the heart's humility
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   through faith in Christ can make all the difference in the world how happily and fruitfully a person with ADD lives.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So in real life, the way ADD and other syndromes work out is that the physical and the spiritual are woven together.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   We are never only physical or only spiritual. Every one of us should strive to know ourselves
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and our peculiar bent towards sinning. It's always influenced by physical reality as well as spiritual.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And then we should embrace, by grace, through faith, embrace all the means of grace
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   and seek to live our humble, loving, helpful lives within the limits and the temptations that we have.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Good. Thank you, Pastor John. And we'll follow up and talk more tomorrow about antidepressants and sleep patterns, diet, and exercise.
