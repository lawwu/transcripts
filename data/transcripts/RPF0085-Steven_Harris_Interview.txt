[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:51.100]   ♪
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.900]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Tuesday, October 21, 2014.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.100]   My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.100]   Today we have an interview with a man named Stephen Harris, who is an expert at all things energy.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.100]   And we're going to talk about very practical and straightforward ways to save money on utility and energy bills.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100]   I hope you find this useful.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.100]   ♪
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.100]   I don't know about you, but as we're just coming back off of the summer here, living down here in South Florida,
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100]   this is our expensive period of time with energy bills.
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.100]   And I have a renewed motivation and focus to really work on saving my energy bills and decreasing them.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.100]   And I've wanted to bring you a very practical resource on the thought process of actually thinking through how to do that.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100]   There are a lot of people probably that could talk to you about it, but one of the people that I thought of
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.100]   that I think is probably one of the most expert people I've ever had the opportunity to come across is a man named Stephen Harris.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100]   And Stephen Harris is an energy expert.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:11.100]   He works now as a consultant, and if it's related to energy, he has some pretty intense knowledge on it.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.100]   Currently he is the founder and CEO of a company called Knowledge Publications,
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   which is the largest energy-only publishing company in the USA.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.100]   And as far as his work history, he came to his current work position to do full-time work on the development
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100]   and implementation of hydrogen, biomass, and solar-related energy systems
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   after spending a 10-year career in the aerothermal dynamics department of the scientific labs of Chrysler Corporation,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.100]   where he focused a lot on some very new types of development of automotive technology.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   I first came across him because he has been a guest multiple times on a show that I've enjoyed listening to very much over the years
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100]   called the Survival Podcast.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.100]   I think he's the number one all-time appearing guest over there.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   And at the end of the show today, I will send you over to some links where you can hear those shows,
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   where he's done a lot of work on emergency preparedness, very, very practical emergency preparedness.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   But his expertise is in the area of energy production.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:26.100]   And again, this is a big deal for me because there seem to be a number of areas that we can target with regard to saving energy
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.100]   that are probably pretty low-hanging fruit for many of us.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.100]   I know I've got some low-hanging fruit in my house and in my household to be able to save on energy bills.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:42.100]   And so my goal is to focus on those things and really build out some savings in that area.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.100]   I think what I've succeeded to do is basically create a primer, an introduction in today's show with Stephen.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   And it's certainly not exhaustive, but it is a good start.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.100]   It's a very good start.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.100]   I do want to give you just a quick outline of what the interview covers.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.100]   My approach in doing the show was basically to use it as a way for me to ask my personal questions of Steve
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.100]   and then allow you to listen in.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.100]   And so I tried to do this in a format of what's appropriate for my personal situation.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.100]   I recognize that many of you will have a very different situation,
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.100]   but I want to have the expertise to be able to create a comprehensive outline for everybody.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.100]   So there's a lot of information in here on warm climates, how to save money on energy bills in warm climates,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.100]   which is where I live.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.100]   And there's also a good bit of information on cooler climates.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.100]   And we talk a lot about insulation, what are the most effective ways to do insulation,
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.100]   what's the low-hanging fruit, where should you start.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.100]   We talk a lot about appliances, what is the low-hanging fruit for appliances,
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.100]   what are the appliances that have a quicker payoff than not.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   We ran through some calculations of how to actually calculate the savings.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.100]   We talked at the end about light bulbs, which I had no idea.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.100]   Just I'll give you the intro in case you don't get there in the full interview.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.100]   But towards the latter part of the interview, we talked about light bulbs,
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.100]   and I thought light bulbs were kind of, "Do them when you can."
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   Steve ran through the actual energy calculations,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.100]   and it certainly seems like the biggest, fastest payoff comes from swapping out light bulbs.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.100]   I never would have thought that.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.100]   I thought it was a bunch of hooey and just do it when you get around to it.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.100]   But he ran through the calculations, and I was very impressed.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.100]   So this interview is going to be--I hope you enjoy this interview.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.100]   If you're interested in more information about Steven and about specific topics,
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.100]   I want to real quick--he sends you a couple of times over to one of his websites called knowledgepublications.com,
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.100]   and this is his company, where they have a number of books that they've pulled together,
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.100]   many that they've published on all kinds of different topics.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.100]   So Steve is a hydrogen energy expert.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.100]   There are a number of books about hydrogen, how to implement it in a practical way,
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.100]   solar energy, fuel cells, how to make fuel at home and make energy at home,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.100]   methanol, alcohol, methane, biomass, heating and cooling your home.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.100]   I would direct you--we didn't talk a lot about heating your home in a cool climate.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.100]   We talked a little bit about it.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   But I would recommend to you--there are a couple of interesting books that he has.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100]   I haven't read them.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.100]   I have ordered his "How to Really Save Money and Energy in Cooling Your Home" book from my house.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.100]   But he's got a book called "Solar Air Heating Systems," and it seems like it's a very thick, pithy book.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.100]   Go and check it out on Knowledge Publications.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.100]   There will be a link in the show notes to that specific book.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.100]   For many of you who are getting ready to head into the winter climates,
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.100]   I think this might be a way that you might be able to take advantage of the free solar heat
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.100]   that falls on your house during the winter to be able to heat your home a little bit.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   And he also has an interesting book called "Movable Insulation."
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.100]   So specifically because we're going into the winter season,
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.100]   go check those books out on his site and take a look at some of the ideas that he has.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.100]   They're fairly comprehensive, and they go through a lot of information
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100]   of some very simple and inexpensive things that you can do to retrofit your house.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.100]   So hopefully that information will be helpful to you.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.100]   Stay tuned at the end.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:19.100]   We talk a little bit about emergency preparedness in the context of preparing for natural disasters,
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.100]   things like that, hurricanes, winter storms, blizzards, things like that.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   I'll mention a couple more comments on that toward the end of the show,
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.100]   but I think you'll be interested in those resources as well.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.100]   Here's Steven.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.100]   So Steven, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.100]   I appreciate you being here.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.100]   Well, I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.100]   It's the first time I've ever been on a personal finance podcast,
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.100]   but you know what?
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.100]   With what I know about energy and how I talk to people,
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.100]   it really makes sense to be on a financial podcast
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.100]   and to look at it through a pair of financial eyes,
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:04.100]   which is what I do and tell people so that people can make intelligent decisions now on their house.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   I'm sure, as you know, you've told people with building wealth,
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.100]   it's not the thunderstorm that comes by that drops all the water or the wealth into your bucket.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   It's the slow and steady drizzle of the rain that fills up your bucket full of wealth.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.100]   And doing things on your home through lighting and heating and cooling changes
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:36.100]   can very much be those very nice steady drops of rain that go into your bucket.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.100]   Right.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.100]   So around here, we're pretty hardcore about trying to optimize everything in life.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.100]   There are only three things that you can adjust to build wealth.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.100]   It's how much you earn, how much you spend, and what you do with the difference between them.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.100]   But we can do a lot with those things.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.100]   So I feel pretty confident in how to save money in a lot of areas,
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.100]   but I feel entirely incompetent when it comes to how to save money on energy bills.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.100]   And so today's show, I'm going to accomplish two things.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.100]   A, it's going to be a little self-serving, is that I need help with this area because my house--
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.100]   I live in a house that was built in 1959, and I live in South Florida.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.100]   And we've just come through the summer season.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.100]   My house is very poorly insulated.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.100]   It's poorly designed from an energy perspective.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.100]   I've got old appliances.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.100]   I've got a 23-year-old hot water heater.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.100]   I've got an old air conditioner.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.100]   I've got an old refrigerator and an old dishwasher, all of which work.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.100]   But I don't have a clue.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:42.100]   So my electric bills were over $200 each month through the summer,
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.100]   and one of them was substantially over $200.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.100]   It was like $260.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   So I've got a lot of room for improvement, but I don't have any idea where to start.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   So it's going to be self-serving for me and also going to help the audience.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.100]   Where do we start as far as saving money on energy bills?
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   How many square feet is your house?
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.100]   It's about 2,000.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.100]   About 2,000.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.100]   In fact, let me check that while a little under that.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.100]   I can't remember whether that's under air or over air.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.100]   I'm not sure. I'll check that for you.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.100]   That's fine. That's fine.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   So where do you want to start?
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.100]   Well, where--so if I'm looking at--what I want to do is I want to provide a framework.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.100]   And if I'm looking at an older house, older appliances, and all of those--
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.100]   I need air conditioning for the comfort of myself and my family.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.100]   How do I figure out what's going to give me the best bang for the buck?
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.100]   Should I go buy a new high-energy air conditioner and invest the money into that?
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.100]   Should I go swap out my 23-year-old hot water heater for a tankless system?
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.100]   Should I swap out my light bulbs for LED bulbs?
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.100]   Or should I go and put insulation in the attic because the attic is poorly insulated?
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   Or should I do some other crazy thing?
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.100]   So how do I even--if I'm looking at a house and I'm recognizing that I need to do an energy audit for it,
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.100]   how would I start? Where do I even begin?
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   Well, you have a forced air furnace for your air conditioner?
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.100]   Yes. Yes.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.100]   Does that work fine for you in the wintertime?
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.100]   We don't use it in the wintertime.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   We just open the windows and we--I don't ever turn on the heat in the wintertime.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:18.100]   Okay. So you are in Florida, and this is really critical to the people listening.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.100]   You're very much in an air conditioning-dominant market.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.100]   Right.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   Where I live in Pittsburgh, we have a distinctive heating season and we have a distinctive cooling season.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.100]   Okay.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   I'm going to try to address this from both the point of view of someone in Minnesota,
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:41.100]   someone in Pittsburgh, and someone in Florida, and hopefully we can really help your listeners.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   Now, the first thing is insulation.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.100]   Keep the heat out. Okay?
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.100]   Okay.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:56.100]   And now, let's say you were living in your house and your AC bills were $100 a month, okay?
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:02.100]   And you've got to look at that and say, "Well, a new air conditioner outside is $2,000,
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.100]   and that will go into my existing furnace if my furnace is working okay.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:14.100]   If I need a new furnace, which they'll try to sell me, I'll have to say no, it's about another $2,000."
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.100]   So you're looking at like $2,000 for a furnace and $2,000 for an AC.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:25.100]   In your case, you would be looking at $2,000 for a new AC because you would keep it in your existing furnace.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:32.100]   So you have to ask yourself, "Am I comfortable with the amount of money that I'm spending every month?"
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:38.100]   Now, I'm guessing that if your AC bill was $100 a month, you'd go, "I'm okay with that."
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   If your AC bill is $270 a month, you're saying, "I'm not okay with that."
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.100]   This is where we are with you right now. You're saying, "I'm not okay with that."
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.100]   So tell me about--is your house a single-floor ranch-style house?
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.100]   Right. Single-floor ranch-style house.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:09.100]   It has a wing that's a bedroom, and it has a wing that's a central living room, kitchen, and a dining room, and then a back room type of thing.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.100]   And then it's got an additional side to it on the north side that has a garage and a laundry room.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.100]   The south side of the house is actually somewhat shaded, which is nice.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:23.100]   There's some big trees there, but then just the south wall, but the rest of the house gets hit with the sun.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.100]   There's no shade on the house.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.100]   You can really feel it.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.100]   Right. If you go up in the attic, it's horrendous, and I can feel the heat coming right through the roof deck or the ceiling right into the house.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:44.100]   So when I go up there, it has some scattered around, blown-in insulation that may be two inches thick in some places and is entirely bare in other places.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.100]   Okay, okay. That makes sense.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:52.720]   Now I have a book for you. It's called How to Really Save Energy and Money in Cooling
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   Your House. And it's at KnowledgePublications.com. That's K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E-P-U-B-L-I-C-A-T-I-O-N-S.com.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.860]   And the, it's purpose for cooling your house is one we'll get to in a little bit. But
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:20.060]   the diagrams of how your house heats up in the book are just precious. And they'll tell
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.940]   you right away what the answer is. I know right away what one of your answers is. You're
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:34.080]   telling me your attic is a sauna. The first thing we gotta do is keep the heat from getting
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:43.500]   into the house. And right now you only have two inches of insulation and you have no insulation.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:54.820]   So the least expensive dollar input would be to have someone blow in more paper insulation,
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:02.420]   which is ground up newspaper insulation. It's really good for trapping heat. You don't want
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.800]   to have to go to the expense of rolling out the fiberglass and everything else. For what
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:18.460]   you want, blown cellulose is your least dollar in to help reduce your heating bill. And I'm
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:27.300]   talking six inches a foot thick. We really want to keep the air from going from the attic,
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:33.420]   the heat from going from the attic and into the house. But that's not the real good answer.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:42.920]   The real good answer is to prevent the heat from even getting past the roof. And most
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.900]   people don't think of this. When I say you insulate your attic, I don't mean you insulate
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.860]   the floor of your attic. You're doing that with the blown cellulose I just mentioned.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:00.040]   If you really want to lower your AC bill, you get someone to come in with a spray foam
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.900]   system. They'll have two long hoses going to a truck, and they'll go up in your attic
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.040]   and wear a suit. And they will spray foam. It's the same stuff you get at Home Depot
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:16.200]   that comes out of a can. Spray it and it foams up, it grows, and then it's real sticky and
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.380]   then it's super insulated and it's hard. You have someone come in and you spray foam your
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:29.260]   attic. And I mean the roof of the attic, what your head would knock into. This keeps the
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:36.860]   heat from getting into the attic in the first place. So if you went up in your attic, it
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.500]   would be almost the same temperature as down in your house minus the air conditioning.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:48.820]   It would be something near outside temperature. And this costs a little bit of money. It's
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:54.500]   more expensive than blown cellulose, but it's a lot better because like I said, we're keeping
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.980]   the heat out in the first place. And some people go, "Oh, my shingles will get too hot
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:09.100]   and they'll..." Oh, shut up. People who know nothing about shingles in this world do that.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.660]   When your shingles are getting hit by the sun and they're cooling down with the attic
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.500]   and everything, they're expanding and contracting. When you have insulation below them, they
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:23.140]   expand and they stay expanded. There's less thermal stress on your damn shingles. It's
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:30.220]   the worst roofing choice in the world than if you don't. So don't listen to the guy who's
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.300]   going to say, "Oh, your shingles are going to..." I know lots of people have done this
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:42.820]   and their shingles have outlasted other people's houses. So go up there and blow in and spray
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.660]   in polyurethane foam. Companies will be happy to do it. You can have them do it when it's
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:56.340]   off season and get it even cheaper. It is the way to go. And if you want to, you can
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.580]   have them spray foam the roof and you can have them spray foam the floor of the attic
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:07.660]   as well. And you're really doubly insulated. Now, here's something for you people in Florida
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:14.180]   what this does. This spraying the foam on the attic turns your entire roof into a composite
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:20.780]   material. It's a sticky glue that hardens, as I mentioned. So it's holding together all
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.940]   your roof joists and the roof itself and everything that's nailed in. It holds it all together
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:34.100]   so your attic is now one piece. And think of this when it becomes hurricane time. You
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:41.540]   now have a super strength roof. The asphalt shingles might get peeled off, but if your
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:51.020]   roof is adequately attached with hurricane straps to the frame of the house, you're golden.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:56.620]   You're really golden. It's going to take a lot to rip that roof off. And if you're doing
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:03.460]   new construction, it's like I'm building my house right now and I'm in Florida, I would
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.900]   spray foam the walls. I would pay the extra money because you'll get your money back in
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.700]   less than five years with spray foam. I would spray foam all the walls. I would spray foam
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.300]   the floor. I would spray foam the attic. I'd spray foam everything with spray foam. It
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.940]   will pay itself off. You'll get all your money back in less than five years. Your house will
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:32.660]   be airtight to the point that you'll probably have to crack a window to get some fresh air
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:38.980]   in. It'll be so airtight that if you've got a fireplace, it won't draft properly. People
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.580]   have to open a window so their fireplace will draft. That's the secret to a really efficient
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:51.940]   house when it comes to heating and cooling is cut out all of the air cracks. It's not
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:20:00.340]   a bad thing. It's a good thing. So spray foam the entire house. And I would do this on a
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.620]   new construction whether I was in Minnesota. Boy, especially in Minnesota, you'll save
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:13.580]   on your heating bill like crazy. Whether you're in Pittsburgh, South Carolina, Florida, Texas,
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:22.860]   Los Angeles, new construction, do spray foam everywhere.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.260]   How would you figure out? Do you know any way to figure out? If I'm trying to compare
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:34.140]   the rate of return between going and getting bags of cellulose from Home Depot, putting
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.260]   them in the hopper and just blowing them in the attic versus hiring a crew to come and
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.860]   do the spray foam, is there any way for me to figure out which is a better move? Or do
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:49.620]   I just have to go with, "Okay, I've got $5,000 to hire the stuff done," or, "I've got $1,000
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.860]   to go and buy the bags of foam?" Is there any way for me to do calculations on that
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.860]   and know?
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:03.380]   Yes, but they're very complicated calculations. And I only know of one guy, if he's still
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.500]   alive, that does those type of calculations and is really good at it and teaches other
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:16.340]   people how to do it. And I can't think of his name, but trust me, even I don't do all
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:23.380]   of his calculations. And I used to be in a thermal group at Chrysler. So the answer really
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:31.780]   is no, there isn't. But you can do it by experiment, because the blowing in of the cellulose is
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:38.980]   your least, lowest dollar cost entry. It's not that expensive. So I would go in and blow
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:47.500]   in my cellulose into my attic and then watch my AC bills. And on my electric bill, they
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.780]   actually show me this year and last year. So I know whether I used more this year than
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.900]   I did last year. Of course, this year was a very cool summer up here in the Midwest
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:05.860]   and the East Coast, compared to last year, which was pretty hot. But still, if you blow
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:14.900]   cellulose up there and your AC bill goes from $150 down to $110, and it stays at $110, and
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.900]   it doesn't go above $110, except for like, you run into August, and you're like, "Oh
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:28.140]   my God, August was so hot," and it goes to $140, well, you probably have made a return
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.700]   on investment with your AC bill.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:38.180]   Have you seen any calculations done as far as what the return on investment could be
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:45.300]   with improving insulation? I have a gut feeling that it very well could be higher than me
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.980]   investing my money in some other places. But I don't know how to actually calculate it.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.260]   Have you seen anybody who's calculated it and come up with any best guesstimates on
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.260]   the subject?
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:03.700]   It all depends upon your instrumentation. Your instrumentation is everything. And your
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:11.860]   instrumentation is what tells you real numbers versus guessing. So right now, your only instrumentation
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:18.340]   is your electric bill. And that's the only piece of information you need now. If you
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:26.060]   go down to Sears, and you get yourself a $50 temperature meter, the one with the little
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:31.420]   laser beam on it, so you can point it at your ceiling, it's a good thing. You can walk
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:39.540]   around, you can point it at your ceiling, and go, "Wow, my ceiling is 105 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.260]   That's radiating right down in here into my room that I'm cooling." Or you might point
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.860]   it up there and go, "Wow, my ceiling is 78 degrees Fahrenheit, and that's what's in the
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:57.100]   room." Then you know your ceiling is not radiating heat down into your house. And you can actually
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:03.460]   walk around with a little IR thermal gun that's just giving you a temperature in Fahrenheit,
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.980]   and you can find out where your heat's coming in. It might be coming in your windows. Your
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.820]   windows might be a significant input of heat into the room. Now, what do you do for that?
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.020]   Well, you can put an awning outside over the window that prevents the sun from hitting
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:28.300]   it, or you can put curtains on the window and close off the heat that way. But if you
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.620]   got some type of instrumentation, it will be your little spyglass, although you might
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:39.460]   be looking like you're looking through a toilet paper tube. It's still a little spyglass into
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:48.220]   the world of thermal that you're trying to go find and detect. So I would definitely
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:55.100]   tell people, "Go get a little $30, $40 IR thermal device." They sell them at Home Depot
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:03.580]   too and Lowe's. And go see on a hot day what's the temperature of your roof inside the house.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:08.540]   What's the temperature in the attic? What's the temperature of the roof in the attic?
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:14.460]   And go get the temperature of the roof in the attic, and you go, "Wow! The wood on my
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:24.500]   roof in my attic is 155 degrees, and the temperature of the blown insulation in the roof is 125
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:30.420]   degrees." And the other thing you might look at as well is you have ventilation in your
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:38.060]   attic. You have like gable vents at the peaks of the roof. You have vents there. Because
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:44.300]   one way of decreasing the heat from... The heat's going to go from the sun to the shingles
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:51.980]   to the wood of the roof to the attic to the insulation to the roof of your room, into
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.380]   your room, into you. That's the path of the heat. You want to find out where can you break
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:05.820]   that path with the least amount of money or with the best return on investment. So going
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:14.100]   up there and finding that, it's like, "Wow! My attic is an oven. It's 130 degrees up here."
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:21.340]   But you get no ventilation. Putting in gable vents with fans that's going to move in 95-degree
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:29.700]   Florida air into your attic. Your attic is now no longer 120, 130-degree oven. It's now
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.380]   going to be the temperature of the outside Florida air moving through your attic. So
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:39.300]   what's going to transfer more heat into... Through the insulation into the roof of your
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:46.820]   home? Is it going to be 95-degree humid Florida air? Or is it going to be 130 degrees of sun
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.220]   from the oven that's up there?
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.620]   Right. If you can get even to the 95-degree air, it's going to be better.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.340]   Yeah. Like I said, the first thing you do is you keep the heat from getting in. And
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:05.220]   that would be putting up spray foam on the roof of the attic. The next thing is keeping
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.540]   the attic as cool as possible through a variety of methods. And one of those is going to be
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:17.940]   ventilation. Another one would be a whole house fan. But a whole house fan is really
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:25.140]   only used generally when it gets cool outside. A whole house fan generally goes into the
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:31.180]   entrance to your attic. And it's like three feet in diameter. And if you're right next
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.900]   to it, it sounds like an airplane motor. It's going really fast.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:35.900]   Right.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:42.220]   And what you do is you open up your doors and your windows. And it's 65 degrees outside.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:49.700]   You turn on the whole house fan and it sucks all that air outside inside the house real
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.820]   quick and blows it up into the attic and out these troughs.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.180]   Do you know if I can integrate... So I actually have a whole... An attic fan, a whole house
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:04.340]   fan. I have both. I have some of those passive things on my roof that spin when the heat
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.940]   is escaping as the wind blows them a little bit as well. And then the eaves are vented
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.420]   and the gable ends are vented. And then I have a whole house fan as well that is set
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   into a central hallway. My understanding on the research that I've done is that if I do
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.700]   the spray foam insulation, that I have to turn the attic into a sealed attic. That I
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.460]   can't keep a vented attic, which would eliminate my being able to use the whole house fan.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.340]   Is that accurate? Is there a reason why that would be the case?
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:39.300]   No. You do not want to seal the attic. You want your attic to be able to breathe. You
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.060]   want moisture to be able to get out of the attic. You want hot air to be able to get
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   out of the attic. So let me tell you, when you make a solar oven, you seal it completely.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:59.140]   You got two layers of glass. You got metal and you got foam insulation all the way around
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:05.300]   it. You point it at the sun and it'll get so hot you can bake a cake in it. The number
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:12.260]   one enemy of a solar oven is air leaks. If I have an air leak, I won't reach 350, I'll
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:21.660]   only hit 250. Your attic is a solar oven. And you want your attic to be a very poor
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:29.100]   solar oven. So you want all of the air leaks, you want all of the ventilation in your attic
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:35.780]   that you can possibly get. All the spray foam is doing is preventing the heat from going
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:42.260]   from the shingles to the wood to the attic. And that's all it's doing. Plus it's making
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.580]   a darn strong roof.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:49.520]   Right. Which is nice. Which is valuable. I've been through a number of hurricanes. You mentioned
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.420]   keeping the heat out. My understanding from third grade science class is that there are
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.100]   three different types of heat. There's conductive, convective, and radiant heat, right? Does
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:04.380]   the spray foam, that would merely address the conductive heat? And do I need to put
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.220]   up additional radiant barriers? They sell the foil barriers. Would I put those up in
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.080]   addition or is that overkill?
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.260]   Those foil barriers are almost scams.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.260]   Really?
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:22.540]   Yeah, they really are. I mean, because the majority of your heat coming in is conductive
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:28.700]   and convective. It's conductive going through the roof, then it's convective going from
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:36.500]   the roof to the air in the attic. And both of those are very strong heat transfer methods.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:44.020]   And the radiant barrier only prevents the heat from, the radiating heat from going out.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:50.980]   It's like, okay, it's zero degrees Fahrenheit outside. You've been exposed outside for 30
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:57.060]   minutes. You're going into hypothermia. I'm an EMT and I come by and I give you a space
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:04.780]   blanket. An ultra-thin space blanket of nothing but mylar. How quickly do you think that's
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.180]   going to heat you up?
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.940]   Not very quickly.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.020]   Not very quickly at all. It's all it's going to do is take your little bit of radiating
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:17.340]   heat from your body and bounce it back into your body. And it's going to try to create
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:25.220]   some dead air space in there to help your convection. But no, I would not recommend
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:33.660]   going with a radiant barrier at all. If you wanted a radiant barrier, it would be outside
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:39.300]   above your shingles. That's where you would block the radiation from coming in.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.020]   Is there any way to do that?
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.020]   No.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.020]   Okay.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   No, but theoretically...
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:49.100]   I guess I could plant trees and I could shade the shingles and that would eliminate the
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.380]   shade, would eliminate the radiant heat. Is that right?
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.380]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.380]   Okay.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.380]   Yep.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.940]   I've gone through, I've tried to design to figure out how to put a latticework of fencing
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:06.860]   across my roof and grow vines over my house and how to get trees growing over it. I've
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.340]   thought through as much as my design capabilities have had, but I haven't come up with a good
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.340]   solution yet.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.700]   Turn your roof into a garden.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.580]   Right. I look at these online, I look at these guys who have living roofs and I mean, it's
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:24.300]   a couple feet thick of dirt sometimes, or they've just got the green roofs. And I think
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.260]   that is brilliant. Like, why don't we do more of that? But I can't figure out how to retrofit
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.660]   my house in an intelligent way to incorporate some of those technologies that are being
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.660]   developed.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:40.100]   Yeah. A roof full of grass. That will stop the heat coming in just beautifully.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.740]   And it seems like it can be in many ways far more durable than asphalt shingles in some
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   cases.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.900]   Oh, by far. Your shingles will love it.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   Right.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.020]   I think asphalt shingles are one of the worst curses ever placed upon a house.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.260]   Why are they so popular then?
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:02.060]   Because that's the way we've been doing it for 35 years.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.820]   What's the best type of roof?
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:13.620]   Well, the best type of roof is a structurally insulated panel roof, which is a piece of
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:22.420]   OSB glued to six inches of styrofoam glued to a piece of wood. That's the best construction
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:27.900]   for a roof, is a structurally insulated panel house in total. But you just put a metal roof
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.820]   on top of that. That's all you do.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:36.220]   Yeah. I look at the metal ones and I seriously, I mean, my shingles are still good, but I
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.060]   will probably lean that direction because it just seems to solve so many problems. And
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:45.220]   the thing I don't understand that I've never gotten the answer to is you can find barns
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.420]   from the early 20th century that have metal roofs. And so why is it that if this technology
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:55.140]   of building a metal roof has been around for a century plus, why do we not use it more
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.220]   frequently? And it's growing dramatically here in Florida, but it's still not standard.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.420]   Yeah, because it lasts forever. Now, if you want to talk about life of a metal roof, you
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   can go to the Roman cathedrals around Europe and in Rome and they will have a copper roof.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:14.140]   And some of those roofs are a thousand years old problems.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.700]   Wow. That's amazing.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:21.860]   Copper roof is really expensive, but you can basically do the same thing with a standard
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:28.100]   metal roof. Now, in your case, when it comes time to put down the metal roof, what's the
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:34.100]   biggest expense in a roof? Generally, it's the material and the time involved. You've
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:40.620]   got shingles and everything else, a big dumpster. When it comes time to have a metal roof, they
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:47.860]   put the metal roof down on top of your shingle roof. And so now you've got two layers of
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.380]   sealant there. You've got a metal roof, and if the roof leaks, you've got a working shingle
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:35:00.460]   roof below it. It might be a 20-year-old shingle roof, but you're putting on a metal roof before
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:05.340]   the shingle roof leaks. So the metal roof is going to turn your shingle roof into a
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:13.980]   50-year, 60-year roof on its own. And so you've got two as one, one as none. And the metal
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.020]   roof goes up in a day, and the old shingles didn't have to come off. And there's your
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.900]   money savings right then and there.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.860]   Made a note. That's a good point.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:32.900]   For new construction, we'll diverge just for a second here. For new construction, all you
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:39.380]   people looking to build, if you can find a builder, if you can find a company, there's
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:48.940]   something called structurally insulated panels, SIPs, SIPs. What they are is they are a composite.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:56.380]   They are a big sheet of OSB, which is like plywood, and it's super glued to a sheet of
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:02.900]   foam, which could be 2 inches, 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches, 12 inches. It doesn't matter.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   And with another sheet on its side, it's like an ice cream sandwich. And they're made in
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:14.740]   big sheets at the factory. What they do is they take the design for your house, and they
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:21.940]   take the computer, and it cuts out the walls and windows and everything for your house.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:28.580]   It goes onto a semi. They bring it out to your house location. They have a crane there,
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:37.460]   and your house is up in 2 days or less. And it's up with a carpenter and 4 helpers. It's
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:46.940]   not up with 4 or 5 carpenters swinging hammers. It goes together very quickly. And then it's
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:53.420]   more expensive than a conventional house. But where's your money in a conventional house?
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:37:00.500]   It's the idiots with the swinging hammers, punching the nails to do stick and frame construction.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:08.780]   So it costs you about 10% more, but your house is up in 2 weeks, ready for the plaster, sorry,
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:14.060]   in 2 days. It's up in 2 days, ready for the drywall people and flooring people to come
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:22.220]   in. And you're in your house in a week or 2 versus waiting 6 months for the idiot builders
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:31.460]   to do their stuff to construct your house. So structurally insulated panels, SIPs. And
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:37.380]   the other one that you might be able to find out there is called insulated concrete forms,
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:45.860]   ICFs. That's where they literally build your walls with Lego pieces of foam, put in rebar,
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:53.580]   have the concrete truck pull up, and they fill the insides all with concrete. And your
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:38:00.420]   basement walls and the walls of your house are done in a day. And then they start the
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.900]   rest of the construction on top of that. Those are 2 very good things for you to look at
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:12.900]   and to contrast with conventional building if you're trying to make a decision on what
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:20.740]   your next house is going to be and you want it to be financially viable both in construction,
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:26.980]   time, and return on investment when it comes to furnace and AC bills.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.500]   I think I'm glad to see some of those technologies being developed because I think a lot about,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.020]   I don't know if you're saying I'm a financial planner, I think a lot about the cost of houses.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.580]   And the biggest cost, I mean there's the initial cost, but then there's also the ongoing cost.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:48.620]   And I think where it seems like much work has been done is in the more eco-friendly
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.340]   older or alternative technology world. So just this week I interviewed a man named Rob
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:39:03.060]   Roy and he lives up, he wrote a book called Mortgage Free and he teaches classes on cordwood
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:08.940]   building methods where they take round log ends and they stack them together with mortar
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:13.300]   and they don't connect, there's mortar on either end of the log end but there's an air
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:18.420]   space in the middle. So the house is very well insulated and 16 to 18 inch thick walls.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:24.780]   And he lives in the northern Maine border, excuse me, northern, I think it's upstate
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:30.780]   New York, excuse me, up by the Canadian border. And his heating costs are, he buys his firewood
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.300]   and spends about 800 bucks a year on heating costs in the northern border. Now he doesn't
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.780]   need air conditioning costs, which is another thing. But I look at that and I say, but I
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.940]   can't do that in West Palm Beach, Florida with Palm Beach County Municipal Building Codes.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:49.820]   There's no chance. So I'm glad to see some of these new technologies that will fit into
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:56.340]   more mainstream looking houses coming out. But it seems as though the demand just isn't
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.900]   there. I still see people, I still see them building houses with concrete blocks around
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.740]   here a lot of times. And I don't understand why the building industry hasn't progressed
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.660]   more quickly. Do you have any insight on why it seems like some of these technologies are
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.580]   so slow to be adopted?
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.460]   Abject stupidity.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:19.460]   You're kind of, you make the nice radical sweeping statements like I do sometimes.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.260]   Absolute abject stupidity. Well this is the way we've been doing it, this is the way I
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.700]   learned it, this is the way everyone else is doing it, this is the way we're going to
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:34.700]   continue to do it. Building codes might not allow it to the newer construction, construction
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.420]   people are not going to be familiar with it. Look, the majority of the construction people
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:45.980]   are not the sharpest nail in the box. Some of the people who run the company and everything
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:52.140]   else might have really good vision and really good understanding, but they're all about
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:57.220]   getting the job and doing the job. They're not a research and development engineer. They're
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:04.020]   a worker. They're not about implementing change because change is risk and what do they want
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:10.740]   when they're building? They want no risk. And it's a variety of factors like that, but
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:17.740]   they all come together to conspire to make it such that it is hard to get new construction.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:24.040]   Now in new construction, if someone tells you this house is eco-friendly, grab hold
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   of your wallet and run away as fast as you can. If they start off telling you, saying
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:37.860]   you're going to have the lowest heating and cooling bills you've ever had with this house,
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:44.620]   continue to listen. But if they start off with this eco-friendly crap, run. Which means
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:50.300]   they've spent a lot of money on some stuff that probably won't work and they're going
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:56.060]   to pass on that cost to you.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:03.060]   One of the biggest ones for me is people often get lumped into camps as far as when it comes
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:10.060]   to environmental things. And on the one hand, I think I'm probably one of the most environmentally
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:17.660]   conscious people. In the sense of it seems stupid to me to destroy the beauty that surrounds
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:25.420]   us and to continue, and it seems smart to me, to preserve it in every way possible.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:31.940]   But what I don't get is why the environmental people haven't simply chosen self-interest
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:38.940]   as their marketing method. And it's essentially become that, well, we have to appeal to someone's
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:44.980]   sense of altruism to sell environmental eco-friendly stuff and play a guilt trip. Well, that's
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:49.460]   not going to do it. Don't tell me my house saves the polar bears. Frankly, I care a little
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:55.260]   bit about the polar bears, but I care as far as I can do it for free. I don't care that
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.980]   much to actually start spending money on the polar bears. But if you can just tell me this
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.980]   house is going to cost you half the money that the other house does, and the alternative
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   benefit of it for "the environment" is better, great, fine, that's an ancillary benefit.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:18.140]   That's how I think about things, is that everything should be win-win. And without launching all
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:22.740]   of the nuance of that argument, I don't see any reason to market energy efficiency as
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:28.680]   eco-friendly or environmentalist in nature. Market it as intelligent design. After all,
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:34.480]   that is what we should be seeking to do, is to engineer everything in our lives to a higher
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:41.180]   level of quality. And that will mean better in every regard for every stakeholder.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:46.300]   You got that 100% correct. I could not have said it better. Environmentalism is a green
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.660]   religion and it's motivation by guilt. It's motivation by making you feel stupid. And
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.340]   it's the only thing you've ever known. It's the only thing you've ever been doing. And
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.180]   they're telling you that you're stupid, that you're bad, and you're wrong, and you need
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:05.040]   to do this. That is not the way you market and get new ideas and new methods involved.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:10.260]   You do exactly what you say. You build it on its positives and its advantages and what
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:17.380]   it can do and its benefits. And that's the way it should be done. But nope. There's this
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:24.340]   girl who's got this really nice, cool little green light that replaces light sticks. And
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:31.100]   she's done a real good job of having some LEDs in there. The LEDs go blink every four
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:37.740]   minutes just to keep the green light sticks glowing really well. And it's a really good
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.980]   design. And she's marketing it saying, "Oh, we have this tremendous waste on light callum
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:48.940]   light sticks. They're horrible for the planet. They fill up the landfill." And it's like,
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:56.860]   "Shut up. There are more milk cartons and diapers thrown away in the landfill in one
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:06.060]   day than there have been of callum light sticks in their entire history, in the last decade,
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:12.100]   just thrown away." And she's motivating by making you feel guilty about using a callum
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:19.820]   light stick and making you think you're filling up the dumpster with the thing when there's
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.860]   bigger fish to fry if you're trying to reduce landfill waste. You don't do it by going after
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:31.020]   the callum light stick. So, just another method of motivation by guilt to get you to throw
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.540]   yourself on your sword so that you'd be paying her money for her thing.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:41.660]   >> Well, that's what doesn't--one more on the same note. What bugs me is when people
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:48.340]   get into what are the emissions of cars and they get into, you know, "Oh, these cars are
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.060]   very unfriendly." And then I go and read some of the papers and read some of the studies
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.740]   and you've got--I don't remember, maybe you know this, but I read a paper one time that
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:02.900]   was comparing the pollution emitted by the 50 largest cargo ships in the world is greater
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.580]   than--was greater than all of the pollution emitted by all of the cars. And I've completely
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:12.820]   made that actual number up, but it was some statistic similar to that. And that's what
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:21.380]   bugs me is that instead of--if--I'm a pretty environmentally sensitive guy and--because
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.740]   I think it's intelligent to be that way. But if you want to get me on board, talk--focus
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.840]   on the 80%--excuse me, focus on the 20% that makes 80% of the difference instead of trying
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.420]   to guilt people into changing their behavior on things that make very little difference
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:41.500]   in the grand scheme of things. And there's a grand paradigm shifting the cargo ships
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:48.020]   over to a new fuel method solely because of economics. They're changing their cargo ships
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:55.340]   to run off of liquefied natural gas, not because of the emissions or anything else, because
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.820]   it doesn't matter what their emissions are, people will still attack them. Right. You
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:05.140]   turn over liquefied natural gas to run in their engines, which they can do very easily.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:10.660]   They just have to add the tanks and the control system, because liquefied natural gas is by
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:18.780]   far many times cheaper than diesel or bunker fuel. Right. So-- Well, it'll work out. Let's
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:24.340]   switch to appliances. So I have a number of very energy inefficient appliances. They're
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:29.340]   old. They all technically work, although my insurance companies require me to replace
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.540]   my hot water heater, so I probably will have to start there just for that. But I don't
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.880]   like to spend money I don't need to spend. But I would like to know, how could I figure
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.980]   out and run some calculations on my appliances to figure out whether I should upgrade them
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:50.380]   before they break for the sake of energy efficiency? Is there a general rule that no, just generally
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.060]   let things live their lifespan, or is there a way to actually calculate it? How would
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.900]   I make those decisions? Well, again, it comes back to instrumentation.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:04.420]   And the point is, you basically got none. Right now, there's stickers on all new things
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.980]   that come. There's stickers on hot water heaters, or stickers on refrigerators, or stickers
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:16.660]   on freezers that tell you the average number of kilowatt hours, or BTUs, this thing uses
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:22.980]   in a year. You can use that to compare and contrast devices you're looking at, but if
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:28.540]   you don't have that sticker on your hot water heater, it's kind of hard to contrast that
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:35.980]   with your hot water heater and to see how much money am I going to be saving. If your
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:42.460]   hot water heater is 20 years old, and mine is, and it still continues to work just fine,
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:50.020]   let me think, how could you measure that? I do have a fluke meter. I don't know how
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.900]   to use it. It's my dad's, but he's an electrical guy. He can probably help me use it. Can I
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:49:00.540]   measure something with that? Or getting one of those kilowatt volts? I mean, that wouldn't
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:05.260]   work on the higher voltage stuff. Your hot water heater is electric?
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:12.340]   It's electric, yes. Oh, I thought it was gas. Do you have the option
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:17.260]   of going with propane or natural gas? I could, yeah. I have a gas dryer.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:22.660]   Oh, go natural gas. Without question.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:33.460]   Without question. It takes one kilowatt of energy is 3,412 BTUs. We're talking about
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:41.340]   your hot water heater is 240 volts, and it's multiple kilowatts of energy. One BTU heats
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:57.980]   up one gallon of water, one degree Fahrenheit. Let's say we got 3,412 divided by 100. It
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:06.380]   would take you one kilowatt of energy to heat up 34 gallons of water, 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:10.540]   Let's say your bath was bigger than that. Let's say it'll take approximately a kilowatt
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:19.020]   of energy with the losses to heat up one full bathtub of water for you, being rough in numbers
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:24.980]   here. Well, that will cost you 10 cents right there, or 12 cents per kilowatt hour, because
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:30.100]   you're using that kilowatt hour to heat up your bath. I've done this for a friend of
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.380]   mine for his hot tub. I said, "Pat, every time you fill up your hot tub, it's costing
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:43.420]   you 50 cents." It would take two or three hot water tanks to fill up his hot tub. There's
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.500]   your return on your investment. All you've got to do is look on the hot water heater,
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:54.580]   and something will tell you that it's a 5 kilowatt or 4 kilowatt hot water heater.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:09.420]   Let's do this number intelligently for you. 100,000 BTUs, which is called the therm, divided
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:18.180]   by 3,412 is 29 kilowatt hours. Let's call it 30 kilowatt hours. 30 kilowatt hours times
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:37.380]   12 cents is $3.60 per 1,000 BTUs. The number we use the most is MMBTUs, which is million
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:46.820]   BTUs. Your hot water heater at 12 cents per kilowatt hour costs you 36 cents per MMBTU.
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:56.340]   Natural gas pricing, with all the piping and the delivery charges and everything else,
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:07.460]   comes out to be between $8 and $10 per MMBTU, per million BTUs. There's your cost savings
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:13.220]   right in front of you. I just did it with a calculator dramatically. Going to natural
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:19.500]   gas with your furnace will be a dramatic savings, a savings that you'll see get your money back
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:26.420]   in two years versus going with electric heat. Electric heat is the most expensive form of
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:37.500]   heat you're ever going to get. I also have an electric stove. Is that blanket
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.460]   rule? Electric heat is going to be the most expensive. If you have a choice between natural
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.580]   gas and electric heat, go with natural gas. Is it a blanket rule?
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:52.380]   Yes, it is a blanket rule, especially when you're doing new construction. Go with natural
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:53:01.460]   gas on everything and electric on as little as you possibly can. You're looking at replacing
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:10.660]   your electric stove. You have to look at it like, "I use hot water every day. I use hot
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:18.060]   water in everything that I do every day." There's a real big expense right there. How
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:27.020]   often do I turn on the stove? Most of the time I use the microwave. How often do I bake?
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:34.980]   How often do I use the countertop? What's a new stove going to cost me? A nice stainless
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:44.100]   steel GE natural gas stove is going to cost you $1,000. Then you're going to have to have
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:51.540]   a plumber run a natural gas line to where your stove is. This will increase the value
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:57.380]   of your house slightly, if you're considering resale value of your house, by having electric
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:09.940]   and natural gas at your stove. Some people love to cook on stove burner on gas and bake
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:16.580]   on electric. There's even ovens out there that do that. Some people are gas lovers.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:22.620]   Some people are electric heat stove lovers when it comes to cooking. You've got to look
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:28.260]   at it like, "How often do I use my stove?" My stove might take 2.5 kilowatts of power
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:32.300]   every time I turn on the burner, but I'm only turning on the burner to cook something for
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   20 minutes. When I'm baking in the oven, I'm baking and it's taking a lot of energy, but
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.580]   the stove is not on all the time. It just heats the oven up to 350 and then maintains
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:55.700]   it. It's not like it's sitting there sucking 25 cents an hour in electricity all the time,
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:55:00.780]   because it's going on and off, on and off, on and off to maintain the heat. Your return
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:08.740]   on investment on replacing your electric stove with natural gas is pretty low. It would be
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:14.260]   10, 20 years to get your money back doing that.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:19.580]   If you look at your hot water system, your return on investment is going to be pretty
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:23.500]   darn quickly. How many people in your family?
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.740]   My wife and I and our one-year-old son.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:34.020]   You're not using a great deal of hot water. You don't have four teenage girls. You have
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.020]   one bathroom or two?
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.020]   Two.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.020]   With showers?
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.460]   Yes.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:46.020]   You might consider what's called an on-demand hot water heater. They cost just a few pennies
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:51.540]   more than a regular hot water heater, but they're simpler to install. They go on the
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:59.540]   wall. They vent directly outside, through the chimney. They keep only a quart of water
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:06.820]   hot all the time. The second you turn on the hot water faucet, that water rushes out to
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:12.900]   give you your instantaneous hot water. The burner comes on and it's instantaneously heating
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:19.820]   the cold water to hot water to continually give you hot water for as long or for as little
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.620]   as you want it.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:29.620]   If you're just trying to do the dishes for 10 minutes, you're not heating up a 50-gallon
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:39.780]   hot water tank all the time, every time, just to do the dishes for five gallons of water.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.460]   Does that make sense to you, to use an on-demand system versus...
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.180]   It does. In fact, that was going to be the next question. Would you still go natural
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:46.180]   gas in that scenario?
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.180]   Yes, of course.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:53.380]   So it's always the same, just natural gas but go with on-demand instead of a tank?
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:57.980]   Right. And let's say you were stuck with electric heat. There are houses in the South that are
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:07.780]   all electric. You really have a high electric bill and you have a lot of people using hot
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:15.260]   water in the house. I would look at an on-demand system that could handle that many people
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:21.020]   versus your existing hot water tank because it'll heat up dramatically.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:26.300]   If you go to the Dominican Republic and some of the other islands in the Southern Caribbean,
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:32.660]   they actually have a shower head with a 240-volt line running right to it. And it heats the
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:36.500]   water up in the shower head before it sprays it on you.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:41.340]   I've showered under one of those many times. Suicide shower. It's a little freaky when
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:47.460]   you look up there and see two wires going into your shower head. But I'm sure that they
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:52.180]   work. And I've wondered if they're even possible to get and have in the US because it just
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:57.980]   seems so simple to me. You put the hot water where you need it and you just create it only
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.980]   when you need it where you need it.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:07.500]   If there's under-sink hot water heaters too, if you're in an apartment or something, there's
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.500]   hot water heaters that will go underneath your sink. They run off 120 volts and they'll
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:17.620]   heat up the water just for the sink for you. And that's a good way to go.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:23.360]   The other thing for hot water heaters is a cozy. If you can go to Home Depot or Lowe's
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:31.700]   and get a blanket to go around your hot water heater, that'll pay itself off pretty quickly.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:38.780]   Just a little bit better insulation and keeping that thing insulated and warmer.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:46.500]   Question because I know you're not just an engineer on traditional ideas. You're also
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:52.540]   kind of Mr. Alternative Energy guy. Here's what doesn't make sense to me. I look at my
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.420]   house and I say, "I've got all this heat outside and I'm keeping the heat outside, cooling
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.720]   the inside. And then I've got this water and I'm going to heat the water up so that in
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:08.420]   my cool house I can put hot water on me." I've tried to figure out how on earth I could
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:15.460]   design some kind of way to use some kind of solar hot water system and integrate it with
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:22.380]   my normal plumbing. Even if I had cold water in the morning, if I could take a shower in
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:27.340]   the evening and I've got the heat all day long and I know it's relatively easy to heat
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:31.840]   water with the sunshine, I can't figure out any way to engineering-wise make that happen.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.700]   Do you know any way to do that and integrate it with the house?
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:42.140]   The simplest way is you get an old hot water heater. You strip off all of the insulation
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:47.420]   off of it. All the metal, all the insulation, so it's a bare hot water heater. And you paint
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:54.420]   the thing flat black. Put the thing outside into the sunshine. And your municipal water
[00:59:54.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   runs into that tank that gets heated up to ambient temperature. And then it goes into
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:10.860]   your hot water tank inside your house. So instead of heating up water that was 60 or
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:20.500]   70 degrees Fahrenheit up to 120 for your bath or for your shower, you're taking water that
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.980]   has gone up to ambient temperature, let's say 90 degrees Fahrenheit, that is going inside
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:32.060]   of your house. So that's one of the easier ways to do it. Now if you take the thing and
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:39.740]   lay on its side, you can build a box around it. You can make a solar oven for it. And
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:47.900]   you'll have hot water that way. I have a book called The Complete Handbook of Solar Air
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:01:08.300]   Heating Systems. And it's at www.knowledgepublications.com. It shows you how to do that. And it does it
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:17.260]   very well. But it's a real small savings in energy. It's not like you think. It's not
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:25.220]   like a big increase in energy. So let's say, how many gallons a day do you think you use
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:35.540]   in your house? I have no idea. Let's say you are using a total of 120 gallons in your house
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:45.700]   a day for your showers. Sound reasonable? Times 8.3 pounds per gallon, multiplied by
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:59.260]   a temperature difference of 30 degrees. That is 29,000 BTUs saved. Let's see, for natural
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:11.060]   energy, 29,000 is 30,000. If that was for electricity, 30,000 divided by 34.12 times
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:25.980]   12 cents. That would be a savings of $1 a day for electric heat. By doing that, so there's
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:47.260]   $1 a day. 30,000 divided by the number of BTUs I have. Let's see, 1,000,000 BTUs. 0.3
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:57.260]   times 8. That would be a savings of 24 cents if you had natural gas. So does that kind
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:03.740]   of put it in perspective for you? Yeah, it definitely does. It definitely does. And in
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:08.980]   the cost-benefit analysis, I use a little shortcut in financial planning of how big
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:14.980]   of a portfolio you need to provide a monthly expense. And I don't actually know, and this
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:19.220]   is one of the things I've been trying to figure out, I don't actually know how to apply a
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:25.900]   financial calculation to what is "worth doing" versus what is not worth doing and where the
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:33.980]   break-even point is. But I do apply a calculation of where basically there's a simple rule called
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:40.500]   the safe withdrawal rate from a portfolio. And the simplest way to do it is to plan that
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:46.580]   you can basically take 4% of a portfolio of assets off under normal conditions. You can
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:55.260]   basically take 4% of assets off essentially into perpetuity. So for every $100,000 of
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:00.340]   assets, you have a $4,000 annual income essentially into perpetuity. So when you're planning for
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:06.220]   financial independence and financial freedom, if you need $40,000 a year to live on, then
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:11.140]   you need a million dollars of assets. But if you can go from needing $40,000 a year
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:17.940]   to needing $30,000 a year, instead of needing a million dollars of assets, you only need
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:25.580]   $750,000 of assets. And oftentimes, it's easier to cut out the $10,000 of expense than it
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:31.900]   is to increase, than to save the extra $250,000 to be financially independent. So the way
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:39.580]   I think about it, I use the monthly number. And so saving $1 a day really doesn't sound
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:45.380]   like that big of a deal. It's really not. But if you say $30 a month and you multiply
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:53.140]   that times $300, you need $9,000 in an investment portfolio in order to pay that $30 a month
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:05:01.860]   expense. So if it costs you $250 to retrofit something, and that $250 saves you $30 a month,
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.780]   that, you can either spend the $250 and not have to save the $9,000, or you can just keep
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:12.020]   on paying the extra dollar and have to save an extra $9,000. And that's the closest I've
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.660]   gotten to figuring out a way to calculate what's worth it and what's not. But I've
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.580]   really struggled to actually have any idea of how to approach these scenarios to figure
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.020]   out what's smart to do and what's not smart to do.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:29.100]   Yep. And see, electric hot water heat is not a smart way to go. It might be the way you're
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.260]   stuck with. So if you've got electric hot water heat, go with on-demand electric hot
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:40.260]   water heat. If you can switch to natural gas or propane, switch to natural gas or propane
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:46.220]   for your hot water heat. If you can't do that, then take an old hot water heater and put
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:53.300]   it outside during the summertime and let the water flow through it in the summertime so
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.940]   it gets heated up to ambient before it goes into your hot water tank so you've got that
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:04.140]   savings of that 30 degrees that you don't have to heat up. Just don't forget to drain
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.380]   the tank and reroute it in the wintertime, otherwise it's going to freeze up on you and
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.700]   you're going to have a mess.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.660]   Speaking of that, because I've never drained a water line in my life worried about the
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:18.880]   freeze, is there anything different about how you've been talking with my situation?
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.700]   Anything different between the subtropical south versus up north where you are as far
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.900]   as how to think it through and where to focus on as far as attention to save money on utilities?
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:42.980]   Well, a lot of focus up here is on heating. From Pittsburgh north, there's a lot of focus
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:49.500]   on heating. In our old house, the furnace gave out, actually the gas control gave out
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:55.860]   and the gas control was going to cost $600 to replace and we're looking at $2,000 for
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:07:03.940]   a new furnace. So we switched out the old regular forced air furnace for a new high
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:11.820]   efficiency multi-stage furnace. It actually vents outside with a PVC pipe. It's called
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:20.580]   a condensing furnace. When you burn something like natural gas, you get heat, carbon dioxide
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:25.300]   and water vapor. Well, that water vapor is steam. You just don't see it and it carries
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:34.060]   a great deal of heat. It carries 950 BTUs per pound of steam. So if you take that and
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:39.820]   you run it through another heat exchanger to condense it down to a liquid, then you're
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:45.100]   getting all that energy back. That's what a condensing furnace does and that's why it's
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.420]   got a water drain on it. Just like your furnace has a water drain on it, your condensing furnace
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:56.340]   has a water drain on it. To get rid of the water that it condenses out of the flue vapor.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:02.300]   And then your flue vapor is like only 140, 150 degrees Fahrenheit and they run it outside
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:09.780]   via PVC pipe rather than an insulated chimney going up to your roof. So we got one of these
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:23.620]   and our heating bills went from like $150 a month down to $60 or $75 a month. It's not
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.300]   so much that we would have done it on its own for saving money because we weren't staying
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:34.460]   in the house for a long time. So if I didn't have to do it, I wouldn't have done it. But
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:41.620]   it kept the house a lot warmer because it's a multi-stage furnace. So when it's not really
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:47.340]   cold outside and it just needs to keep the house warm, it's running on low. So you got
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:54.020]   this continual gentle heat coming out of the air ducts all the time. And if it gets colder
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.540]   outside it'll increase this a little bit more. And if it's minus 20 outside it'll be going
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:06.940]   full like a full blown furnace. Burners going all the time, full burner, full fan, blowing
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:16.540]   out of the air ducts and it's still condensing. So it's still a very efficient furnace. But
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:26.420]   we noticed the change significantly in our old house. And now we're in a newer house
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:35.460]   and a much bigger house. Went from like 1400 square feet to 3000 square feet house. And
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:42.500]   it's got its original 20 year old furnace in it. But our heating bills are only like
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:53.900]   $150 a month, maybe $200 at most during the polar vortex of last year. And that's acceptable
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:10:03.900]   to us for a heating bill versus having a $2000 furnace installed. But I tell you when time
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:09.140]   comes and it gets close, I'm not going to wait for it to break. We're going to wait
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:15.860]   for the off period of the season like spring time or summer and say, "Hey, I need a new
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:20.420]   furnace. Okay, we'll be there tomorrow." And we'll get a good price on a furnace by buying
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:25.740]   it off season. We make the decision of when to do it rather than letting the furnace make
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:35.460]   the decision for us when to do it. And amazingly, it's been a very cool summer here in Pittsburgh.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:41.700]   Our AC bills, both last year and this year, have not been too outrageous. Our highest
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:51.340]   AC bills have maybe been about $300. And it's averaging some place in the low $200s. And
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:11:00.820]   that's with the furnace set on, the temperature set on 77, not 73 or 72. 77 with the ceiling
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:06.020]   fans going and everything. And it just really hasn't crossed that threshold. Even though
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:17.540]   it's a 20-year-old AC unit, it's still functioning within our budget. You factor in our taxes,
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:26.380]   what we paid for the house. We're paying $8000, $9000 a year in just taxes to live where we
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   are living.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.380]   My goodness, man, move!
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:38.580]   It's a very nice area. Everything is convenient. We actually have the cheapest house in the
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:44.780]   neighborhood. Both of the houses in the neighborhood are a lot more, two, three, four times the
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.380]   price of ours. So that's always a good thing to have the cheapest house in the neighborhood.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.860]   That's good for financial investment.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:59.940]   I say that somewhat jokingly. I have heard of many tax bills that may be many times that.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.140]   I've been in houses on Palm Beach where the property tax bill is a couple hundred thousand
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:12.500]   dollars a year. But I guess I'm so cheap that property taxes are just one of those fixed
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:19.460]   expenses that they're never going to go down. And it makes me think a lot about other places
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.780]   where they're cheaper.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:31.220]   If I did a new AC system and a new furnace system, I could probably lower my monthly
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:39.980]   bill by $100 a month. Which means I would be saving $1200 a year. And that's $4000 of
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:45.940]   expense. That's $2000 of expense for a new high efficiency air conditioning system. And
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:56.060]   $2000 for a new furnace to be installed into my system. So that's a $4000 increase. And
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:09.100]   $4000 divided by, conservatively, $100 is going to be $40. So we're looking at, well,
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:18.140]   maybe I should do this. $4000 divided by $100 is 40 months. 40 months divided by 12. I could
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:25.620]   be looking at a return on investment in three years. So where as I've been going, wow, I
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:33.740]   don't really want to do that at this moment. That's a 3.3 year return on investment. So
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.140]   I should probably be changing my mind and thinking about putting in that new furnace
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:44.100]   and AC system as soon as possible. Thanks!
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:52.220]   There we go. That's a good outcome for a personal finance show. I'm glad I got you to do the
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:59.140]   numbers. So this is an area, and what I try to do with clients is talk through all these
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:06.300]   different options. And this is an area that I don't know how to run these calculations
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   of how to help figure it out. So this has been helpful. I want to close with two questions,
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.300]   though.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.540]   Oh, we're not closing yet. We got more to go on. You got more questions.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:22.140]   Yeah. Okay. Here's the question that I'm interested in. And I'm going to spring it on. You may
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:29.420]   not know. So I have a concept that I think a lot about. And the concept is how can I
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:37.900]   buy the luxuries of life, as in a roof over my head, a comfortable environment, whether
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:45.580]   those are the necessities or the luxuries of life, for an upfront cost that makes sense,
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:52.020]   but focus on technologies that will last forever with a minimum amount of maintenance and a
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:57.460]   minimum amount of cost. The problem is that I don't have the scientific background to
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.660]   really be able to analyze some of the different things. So I spent a lot of time on -- I have
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:07.460]   spent a lot of time on YouTube just kind of looking through different technologies. And
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:13.580]   I look, for example, I look at something, you know, just A, designing a house with good
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:19.740]   solar design for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. Designing a heating
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:25.180]   system maybe based -- maybe it's based on -- I mean, I never lived up north. But I look
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:31.120]   at, you know, the videos that I find on, you know, rocket mass heaters and efficient wood
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.580]   stoves with well-built insulated houses all around. I look at some of the technologies
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:42.300]   of building design that where instead of -- where it seems much more enduring. I think about
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.860]   the idea of putting on a copper roof that may last a thousand years. Like, how could
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:51.140]   I build a house that would last for a thousand years that wouldn't -- isn't just going to
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:58.140]   be degrading in 30 years? And I think about how could I design a system that -- I guess
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:07.140]   just better design. If you were going to design a house and I gave you the task, knowing what
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.280]   you know about engineering and design, if you were going to design a house, and I gave
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.980]   you the goal, I said, you know, "Steven, I'm going to live here for the rest of my life.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:20.180]   I don't mind spending now on the things that I need to spend now. But I want these things
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:25.140]   to be enduring technologies that aren't going to break, that are going to be very low maintenance,
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:29.540]   that are going to be very low ongoing cost." And the goal of this, by the way, is to get
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:36.380]   -- is to be able to stave off the effects of inflation on my expenses. So if I'm depending,
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:41.180]   for example, on a high electric bill, well, that electric bill is going to be driven by
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.740]   the cost of the energy by the power plant and also by the cost of keeping the power
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:52.500]   plant employees employed. So that means that over time, if I'm planning on how to be financially
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:59.500]   independent -- excuse me -- I have to provide for increasing cost of energy. And if that
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.620]   happens, maybe I have decreasing cost of energy, maybe things transition from coal to natural
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:08.420]   gas. I don't know. But I have to plan for that. And I also have to plan for increasing
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:15.060]   wages for the workers involved. So I think, "Well, how can I just buy the system now that's
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:20.540]   going to keep it and just pay for the technology so I can eliminate the effects of inflation
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:27.060]   over time?" How would you design a house, given that design framework? What specific
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.380]   technologies would you focus on?
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.420]   One answer. A monolithic dome.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.740]   Buckminster Fuller's invention.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.980]   No, no.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:39.940]   I was thinking geodesic. What's a monolithic dome?
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:46.940]   Monolithic dome. I've had the $1,000 one-week-long contractor course for it down in Italy, Texas.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:55.940]   It's monolithic.com. They're the greatest, most honest people in the world. And they
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.980]   will help you design or they'll help you find a builder and/or they will build the monolithic
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   dome for you. Anywhere from the size of a house for one person all the way up to an
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:15.940]   entire school or church. They'll do it. And a monolithic dome, what it is, is you get
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:23.380]   a rubber form for your dome. First thing you do is you pour the floor. You've got rebar
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:30.060]   sticking up out of the floor. And then you attach down your form. And then you put a
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:36.700]   great big fan to inflate the form. And there's an airlock, like a two-door airlock, so you
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   can lock in and lock out. And you can walk on the inside of this dome. So you're inside
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:51.420]   this great big balloon. And you have a, first thing you have is you have a foam gun. And
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:58.140]   you are going to spray three to four inches of foam all the way around on the inside of
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:05.140]   the dome. And I'm talking three to four inches, okay? That is a big hefty amount. Then you're
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:11.260]   going to go put up the rebar. And you put all the rebar up right next to the foam and
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:16.900]   everything. Then you come in with a shotcrete pump. And you are shooting concrete onto the
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:23.900]   wall three inches thick. So all the concrete is on the inside. The concrete's not on the
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:33.580]   outside. This is a house. Well, one, it's done in less than a week. You literally got
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:41.780]   interior people going in, doing walls and drywalls in one week. Okay? That's how fast
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:48.780]   these things go up. You're looking, when they do mega churches and mega schools, they have
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:57.020]   the numbers, solid numbers that they showed us. This multi-million dollar, ten million
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:04.020]   dollar school pays for itself in 17 years in Texas on the AC cooling alone.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.580]   Wow.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.220]   Okay? Alone.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.860]   Wow. That's awesome.
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:17.860]   You have no roof. You have no shingles. Okay? It's made out of concrete. They did some of
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:25.860]   the storage facilities in Iraq prior to Desert Storm. And the generals actually had to call
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:32.500]   up and say, "How did you make this thing? What's it made out of?" And they said, "You're
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.580]   going to need two bombs to get through it." And they would drop one bomb to break a hole
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.700]   in it and drop another bomb to go through the hole and blow up what's on the inside.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.780]   Wow.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:46.660]   These are literally 400 year houses or longer or more. That's how long these things are
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:53.660]   going to last because they are a concrete house. And when they build the small, they
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:21:01.020]   build rental units for people. And so you can come in as an investor, you can have 24
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:05.860]   rental units put on a piece of commercial property, you can collect the rent from the
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:12.740]   people, and it's a one person thing. It's about 400 square feet with a living room open
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:19.740]   to a kitchen and then a bedroom and a bathroom parked away behind a wall. In Texas, they
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:29.180]   literally cool this with a small 5000 BTU air conditioner. And it'll turn that room
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:32.980]   ice cold chilly.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:33.860]   Wow.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:40.860]   And the only heat for the house is a standard plug-in-the-wall 1500 watt electric heater.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:48.860]   And it will keep that as toasty warm as you could want in the coldest Texas temperatures.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:55.720]   So they are the ultimate when it comes to heating and cooling efficiency. In fact, insurance
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:01.660]   companies won't insure them because they're just so strange. The insurance company doesn't
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:02.380]   know what to do.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.860]   You probably can't finance them either.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:11.860]   Yes, you can finance them depending upon where you're going. But it's going to cost about
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:20.380]   $200 per foot per square foot, which is not bad. And it's about twice the cost of a normal
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:27.340]   house to do. But your return on investment on this thing is in single or double digit
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:33.740]   years. Look, you've got no roof to go on there, you've got no labor for the roof, you've got
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:38.940]   no maintenance of a roof. The insurance company, you don't need them to insure the structure
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:45.940]   because what's going to happen? You insure the contents of the house is what you insure.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:52.740]   So if you had a fire happen inside the house, big deal. You clean everything out, bring
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:59.300]   in a fire hose, clean all the scorches off of the concrete, and then rebuild the interior
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:06.300]   of the house. It's 100% tornado proof, it's earthquake proof because it's all one unit.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:13.780]   It's attached. If the ground fell away below half the house, the house is going to sit
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:20.780]   there as a single monolithic piece of equipment with half the earth underneath the house missing.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:28.900]   So you can shake and bake and rattle these things all around all you want because the
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:34.620]   dome is attached to the slab and the slab is attached to the earth. It just is not going
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.260]   anywhere.
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:40.900]   That's cool. I've never heard of it. I thought I'd spent enough time researching this stuff
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.700]   to see most things, but I'd never heard of this. And the cool thing about this is unlike
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:50.060]   some of the technologies I've seen, I'm looking on their website, there are enough different
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:54.740]   designs that have plenty of windows. So that would keep my wife happy to have plenty of
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:58.020]   light, unlike some of the things I've proposed to her.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:01.580]   You can have a whole house with windows if you want. In fact, if you want, you can have
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:08.260]   an 11-sided house or a 10-sided house. You can have an 8-sided house. They're called
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:15.260]   stem walls. They're vertical walls that go up. It looks like a regular part of a house
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:23.220]   to you. You've got flat walls, you've got windows and doors and everything. It's not
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:30.220]   curved. And then the dome is the ceiling. That makes a lot of people who go, "I don't
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:37.140]   want a dome like that." It makes a lot of people look at it and go, "I'd have a dome
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.420]   like that because it's got vertical walls and then a dome ceiling."
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:49.420]   And so it's endless with what you can do with a monolithic dome. If you were building a
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:56.180]   house for the first time and you could afford to get the mortgage and you could afford to
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:00.900]   pay twice the price, and you were going to be there for long term, this is where you're
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:05.780]   going to raise your three or four children and everything, a monolithic dome would be
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:12.780]   the way to go from a financial point of view because it would pay for itself within 10
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:19.500]   to 15 years on heating and cooling alone. Maintenance alone, you figure in maintenance
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.820]   costs...
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:29.380]   I have re-roofed, I'd have no idea, but I must have re-roofed 15 to 20 houses over my
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:33.420]   lifetime. If I never had to re-roof an asphalt shingle roof again the rest of my life, I
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.740]   would be a happy man. And just even that.
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:42.780]   The other thing that strikes me about this is that with a structure built with great
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:49.580]   strength, then you could much more confidently retain the risk of natural weather events
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:54.660]   and drop the insurance. And that is a massive savings right there, especially for where
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:26:01.540]   I am. You can't drop the insurance when you have a mortgage, but if your house is not
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:06.020]   built to take it, then when you think about retaining the risk, you have to really consider
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.860]   it. And so you're usually going to transfer it to the insurance company, but if your house
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:14.300]   is built to take it, you can much more comfortably just retain the risk of the weather events.
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:19.020]   What's your insurance risk in Florida? How much are you paying per year for insurance
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.780]   because you live in a hurricane zone?
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:27.780]   Right, so it winds up being about $4,000 a year right now for my house. My dad was able,
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:33.980]   I mean, with his insurance, mine doesn't just split this out, but with his, he dropped hurricane
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:40.100]   coverage and it saved him something like $5,000 to $6,000 a year just by dropping insurance
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:44.820]   coverage. I'm sorry, dropping hurricane coverage and keeping everything else.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:50.060]   I'm paying $1,000 a year for insurance on a house in Pittsburgh.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.900]   Wow, so there's the difference.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.340]   Oh yeah, there's a big difference right there.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.820]   Huge. And the thing is, it's very difficult for me to work through because if you actually
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:04.980]   sit down and intellectually approach the insurance question and you think, "Okay, can I retain
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:09.460]   this risk?" When you actually look at the deductibles a lot of times that you have,
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.540]   and I've been through enough hurricanes, I've seen enough houses that have been impacted
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:19.100]   by hurricanes, and it is possible that you may have a completely destroyed house. But
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:25.420]   in general, if your house is up to code, it would be pretty unusual for your house to
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:31.140]   be destroyed by the wind. And so I've repaired the houses that have been hit by hurricanes.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:36.140]   And it's hard though, because you're sitting there kind of thinking, "Well, how do I look
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:41.460]   at this rationally versus the deductibles and all of that?" And I very well may drop
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:46.020]   mine at some point in the future, because I'm pretty confident in my ability to recover
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:49.580]   from it and my ability to retain the risk, but it sure would feel better with a differently
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:28:03.300]   designed structure. So last question I'd like to ask you today is, I get questions a lot
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:09.180]   of times even on providing for energy. And so you've got the question of saving energy
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:17.500]   that we've talked about. How do I do heat? How do I figure out what appliances? Should
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.780]   I swap out my incandescent light bulbs and buy LED light bulbs? So that's all the saving
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:22.780]   side.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:29.620]   Oh, we didn't talk about light bulbs. I knew we were missing something. Light bulbs. Okay.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:34.080]   Here's the thing with light bulbs. A regular incandescent light bulb that provides you
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.220]   X amount of light. But the thing is, it provides you also 20 times the amount of heat that
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:47.500]   it does light. And so every BTU you put into the house with your light bulb has to be removed
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:52.900]   by the air conditioner. Now the air conditioner is working on a coefficient of performance
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:29:02.220]   of three to one. So if you put 100 BTUs per hour of light, actually let's say 350, because
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:07.260]   100 watt light bulb will put off 350 BTUs per hour of both light and heat. And all the
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:14.580]   light is turned into heat anyways. So you put in 350 BTUs an hour with 100 watt light
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.940]   bulb and incandescent. Then your furnace AC system is running, it's running on what we
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:24.580]   call a coefficient of performance of three to one. And remember, it's moving heat. It's
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:31.420]   pumping heat. It's not taking the same amount of energy to remove it. So it takes one third
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:47.540]   of the amount of energy to remove that light. So it would take just over 100 BTUs of AC
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:55.980]   pumping to remove that 350 BTUs per hour from your 100 watt light bulb. So everything you
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:01.740]   do in your house, your AC has to work. When you have a refrigerator and you open the door
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:06.860]   and put stuff into it, the refrigerator kicks on, it's moving the heat that you just let
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:14.380]   into the refrigerator out of the refrigerator through the back of it with a heat pump and
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:18.940]   it's doing it in a ratio of about three to one. So you're taking heat, putting it in
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:24.820]   the refrigerator and the refrigerator is moving the heat out of itself. And at the same time,
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:30.460]   it's making a little bit of heat to heat up your house. So everything you do in your house
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:37.100]   is making heat that the AC system is going to have to remove. So what you want to do
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:42.580]   is you want to minimize your heat. So there are compact fluorescent bulbs and there are
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:50.500]   LED bulbs. And it's year 2014 right now and LED bulbs have fallen in price dramatically.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:59.620]   Now generally, right now, compact fluorescents are a little cheaper than LED light bulbs.
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.780]   And compact fluorescents are the ones that have mercury on the inside of them to a very
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:12.340]   slight amount. Break one, you spill an infinitesimal amount of mercury that you'll never detect.
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:17.060]   But that's the big war. There's always a war on something every time they want you to change.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:22.060]   When they changed from incandescent to compact fluorescent, it was like incandescents are
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:28.060]   killing the planet. And now they want you to go to LEDs, they're saying incandescents
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:32.380]   have mercury in them. When they want you to go from LED to something else, they're going
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:40.500]   to tell you LEDs have arsenic in them. And LEDs do have arsenic in the silicon to form
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:49.660]   the silicon gap that makes the light. So anyways, the thing with compact fluorescents and all
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:56.540]   fluorescent bulbs, they don't like to be turned on and off all the time. If you're going downstairs,
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:32:02.420]   flip it on, come back upstairs, flip it off, you do this 10 times a day, compact fluorescent
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:09.140]   is not going to like it. It is going to burn out before it reaches its life of like 8 years,
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:17.140]   is what they say. So if you have a place like every night you're going to turn on this lamp,
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:23.820]   great place to put a compact fluorescent bulb. And it's either 60 watt equivalent or 100
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:29.500]   watt equivalent or whatever size that you so desire. It's a great place to put one.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:36.100]   If you have lights that you are turning on and off all the time, LED bulbs don't care.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:42.900]   They can go on and off 100 times a second and it won't affect their life one iota, one
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:50.460]   bit. So they're great to put into locations like that. LED bulbs also give you all the
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.940]   light instantaneously the second you turn them on. They don't have to warm up. Some
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:33:00.220]   compact fluorescents aren't what they call instant on. If they are instant on, they'll
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:05.420]   say so on the package. But you turn them on and as they warm up, they give you a better
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:11.300]   glow and it takes about a minute. So if you want a place where you want the light to come
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:18.380]   on instantly, you're going to put in an LED bulb in there. And actually at Home Depot
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:23.540]   right now, there's these LED bulbs, I forgot the name of the company that's making them,
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:30.100]   I think it's Philips. They look like lollipops. They look like suckers with a rim around them
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:39.300]   where the LEDs are. And Home Depot is selling the 60 watt equivalent bulb for $4. It's funny,
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:48.820]   the 40 watt equivalent bulb is $8. But they're really pushing them out at $4 a piece. Your
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:56.620]   100 watt equivalent LED light bulb, which is just new on the market from Cree, C-R-E-E,
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:03.700]   Cree light bulbs, 100 watt light bulb will cost you $15. Now the question is, how long
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:08.180]   would it take you to get your money back on this? And I did the calculation some time
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:15.180]   ago. If you had a 60 watt incandescent light bulb, you left it on all the time, 24 hours
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:23.420]   a day. And then you had a 60 watt equivalent light bulb that was compact fluorescent, how
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:29.620]   long would it take you to get your money back? If you ran them both side by side, 24 hours
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:38.060]   a day? Well, these 60 watt compact fluorescent light bulbs were going for about $2.50 when
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:44.500]   you were buying like a pack or 12 of them. The answer to that question is, with 10 cents
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:50.540]   per kilowatt hour electricity, which is normal in the United States, California, Seattle,
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:56.900]   they even inflated theirs through taxes to 25 cents a kilowatt hour. So for a normal
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:05.540]   kilowatt hour rate for the United States, it would take two weeks of 24 hours a day
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:14.140]   for that $2.50 compact fluorescent light bulb to pay for itself. So if you have a place
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:20.980]   where you want that 100 watt bright light bulb, and you're paying $15 for the LED light
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:28.260]   bulb, rest assured, you're going to get your money back in less than a year. And then you're
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.900]   not going to have to replace it, because the LED light bulb is literally going to last
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.980]   upwards to 20 years.
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:43.860]   So that's pretty compelling. So it sounds like of all the places to start, light bulbs
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:48.460]   would be one of the simplest places to move the needle as far as energy use.
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:53.980]   It would be the easiest place to move the needle as far as the energy goes. And the
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:59.100]   LED bulbs are a little bit slightly more efficient. They say they're 25% more efficient than the
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:06.740]   compact fluorescents. So the better the light bulb, the less heat it is going to be putting
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.020]   out into that room, which means the less heat the air conditioner is going to be moving,
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.420]   which means the lower your electric bill. So you're going to save money on electricity
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:21.820]   on the bulb, and you're going to save money on electricity when it comes to air conditioning
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:28.260]   if you're in an air conditioning dominant environment like you are in Florida.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:33.340]   Now if I'm in a cold dominated environment, is that an efficient source of heat as far
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:39.500]   as to accomplish both things? Would that decision be different if I'm in northern Canada?
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.940]   What did we cover earlier? What's the most expensive form of heat?
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:43.940]   Electric.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:49.740]   There you go. That's your answer. So it's like a little electric heater. And if you
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:54.940]   got an incandescent bulb there, yeah, it's going to be offsetting your heat, but it's
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:37:04.580]   going to be heating at the same cost of electricity. So if you had electric heat up in the Midwest
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:11.060]   or the northern portions of the climate, it wouldn't matter if you left your incandescent
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:19.020]   bulb on or not as a source of heat, because it would only be heating your house with electricity.
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:24.100]   But up in the Midwest and in the North, all the homes have propane or natural gas, so
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:27.460]   that is a moot point to begin with.
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:28.460]   Got it.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:34.100]   Now there's one other thing we should cover while we're talking about houses. Heat pumps.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.100]   Explain.
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:45.180]   A heat pump is popular in the southern United States pretty much. And what it is, any air
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:52.180]   conditioner can become a heater. And what happens in air conditioning mode, it's moving
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:59.900]   heat from the inside of the house to the outside of the house. So the evaporator is inside
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:06.660]   the house where everything gets cold and the condenser outside gets warm. Well, you reverse
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:15.220]   the pump and do a few other things, and it's wintertime, the condenser on the outside of
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:22.580]   the house will get cold. So if it's 40 degrees outside, it's going to be 20 degrees on the
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:28.620]   condenser. It's going to be moving heat to the evaporator in your furnace, and you're
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:33.860]   going to be running the furnace, and it's going to be blowing hot air through the house.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:40.900]   That is a heat pump. And they generally are more complicated than what I just described,
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:47.820]   and they cost a lot of money. I'm talking $15,000 for a heat pump. But people say, "Oh,
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.780]   I get my money back on them and everything else." Well, a lot of people get suckered
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:39:02.060]   into these things. And briefly, there's three main types. There's the air-to-air heat pump
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:07.940]   that I just described, which is your box sitting outside. Those are very low in efficiency.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:12.860]   There is the ground loop one, where they dig four feet down. Have you ever seen this? And
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:15.780]   they bury 200 feet of tubing around your yard.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.780]   I've heard of it.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:22.940]   So what they're doing is they're using the ground heat as a source of heat and cooling
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:27.940]   for your heat pump. So depending on where I'm at, the ground temperature is always 65
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:35.100]   degrees Fahrenheit, four feet. So the heat pump in the wintertime is taking the 65 degree
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:42.900]   temperature and it's compressing it, and it's making it 95 degrees to heat your house to
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:51.540]   75 degrees. And in the summertime, it's taking that 65 degrees, making it cooler down to
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:40:01.100]   50 degrees, and it's using that to cool your house. So it's pumping the heat from the earth
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:06.660]   to the house, and it's pumping the heat from the house into the earth, depending upon the
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:08.940]   time of year.
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:13.260]   Now both these are expensive, and the ground loop is better than the air to air one, but
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:21.940]   the ground loop one sucks compared to a well one. If you got well water on your property,
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:28.620]   you can use this as fluid to fluid to heat exchange. It's as good as it gets. Air to
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:34.900]   air, air is an insulator. It's very bad. Buried loop in the ground, you're conducting the
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:44.220]   heat between a pipe with air in it and the ground. Not a good heat conductor, but it
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:50.260]   does conduct. When you got well water, you got well water coming up, going into your
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:41:00.140]   heat exchanger for your heat pump, you got really good heat conduction from one side
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:07.780]   of the heater to the other side of the heater. And this becomes very efficient. This is the
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:12.980]   most efficient type of heat pump, and it's the only type of heat pump I'd recommend someone
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:20.540]   getting is if you have ground water or you got like a big pond on your property, several
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:27.180]   acre pond, then using a water loop or a water up and down, you have a well going up, you
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:31.740]   have a well going down. I've even seen people do it with just a well up. They got like a
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:39.940]   gallon per minute of water spilling out onto the grass from their well, no big deal. Then
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:45.420]   you can get into a savings, especially if you're in the south because you're dominated
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:52.820]   by cooling. Heat pumps, although they are installed in the north, they don't work anywhere
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:59.100]   as near as good because the ground temperature is so much lower and the outside air temperatures
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:04.700]   are so much colder. So if you're looking at a heat pump and you think, oh, you're a salesman
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:10.420]   telling you all these great numbers, you look at the numbers real carefully and look at
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:16.900]   your initial cost expenditure versus your estimated return on investment because they
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:24.860]   generally are not going to be a good investment for you. Many times if you got natural gas,
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:30.860]   it'll never beat it. Natural gas will always win. It might compete with propane. It definitely
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:38.700]   is a lot better than straight electric. But that's the story on that. There's one other
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:41.260]   thing we should cover, that's solar panels.
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:48.340]   Yes. That was actually what my last question was going to be, is on the creating energy
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:54.460]   side, then you say, okay, we've conserved, now can I create? And for the same reason
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:01.500]   why I'm attracted to why I described the scenario I described about house, I'm attracted to
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:07.440]   the idea of if I could create the energy and just buy the equipment and then provide that
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:15.240]   energy for myself going forward, that would eliminate the inflation of the bill over time.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.740]   How would I figure out if that were smart to do or not?
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:22.740]   It's not smart to do. Dream on.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:28.900]   You're going to make some of my listeners very unhappy because I interviewed Jacob Lundfisker
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:35.820]   who wrote the book Early Retirement Extreme, and he said solar panels stink. And I had
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:40.300]   at least one comment on the post from people saying, well, I figured it, I did it and I
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:45.180]   had a break even in five years due to my, in my situation, maybe due to the tax incentive
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.140]   or something. So why do you say that?
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:52.460]   Well, first of all, these are called grid-tie solar panels. So they're up on your roof,
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:58.060]   they're tied to the grid, and when your power fails, they will do nothing for your house.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:02.460]   You got no battery system, you got no backup system, they will not power your house, they
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:06.780]   have to power the grid, they use the grid as the battery. So you're putting them up
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:13.300]   there for economic purposes only. Now, some socialist states, they are taking your money
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:17.820]   and my money, they're stealing it from us, and they're handing it to these people who
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:24.620]   are putting solar up in terms of rebates. And that's lowering their cost to put up their
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:30.460]   solar panels. Then, they've taken a knife and put it into the back or held it to the
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:37.020]   neck of the utility, and saying, instead of paying these people a deferred rate of 2.8
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:42.740]   cents per kilowatt hour, which is the deferred rate is the cost of electricity they'll have
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:49.620]   to pay for their next utility plant, they're forcing them to pay you 10 cents per kilowatt
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:56.620]   hour, in some cases 20 cents per kilowatt hour because of your solar, you're selling
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:02.900]   back solar energy. Now, when you use these falsely inflated numbers that are done by
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:09.900]   coercion and corruption, your return on investment might be 5 to 8 years on the system. However,
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:15.980]   if you look on CNBC, I just sent an article to a friend of mine who just asked me the
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:22.980]   same question, utilities are saying to government, this is not fair that you are making us pay
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:29.940]   these people this exorbitant amount of money because it only costs us 2.8 cents to make
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:35.900]   it and you're making us pay them 20 cents per kilowatt hour. We want to control the
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:42.220]   rates and we want the rates to go lower. So, all great, you've just taken $40,000 of your
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:49.220]   life savings, installed solar panels on your house, and you've gotten your rebate, and
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:57.460]   now you're getting your monthly check from the utility company, and halfway through your
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:03.900]   return on investment, the law changes, the rug is pulled out from underneath you, and
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:10.700]   you're sitting there with that feeling in your stomach like you're ready to puke. Solar
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:16.740]   panels are the most expensive form of electricity you will ever find.
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:20.260]   Even with the recent decreases in cost, as I understand it?
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:26.780]   Yep, it takes over 30 years. Solar panels are made with high temperature electricity.
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:33.500]   You grow the silicon, and it's done with very pure heat, which is high temperature electric
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:38.980]   heat, and then the wafers are sliced, the wafers are doped, and they're turned into
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:45.980]   solar panels. So, your solar panels are made with inexpensive nuclear electricity in Japan
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:52.740]   and moved over here, and you put them out in the sunshine, and it will take over 30
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:59.740]   years of Arizona sunshine in August at noon, with the panel pointed directly at the sun,
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:05.220]   for it to output the same amount of electricity that it took to make the panel.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.380]   Really?
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:13.380]   So, solar panels are for energy independence. If you want to be off the grid, if you want
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:20.980]   to be disconnected from the man, if you want to be your own power company, solar panels
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:27.980]   will work for you. However, be it known, you are paying the highest price there is for
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:36.980]   electricity. But you own it. It's yours. No one's going to take it away from you. When
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:41.820]   everyone else is black, you're not going to be black. You're going to have lights on in
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:47.180]   your house and everything else. But keep in mind, generally you don't size the solar panels
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:54.180]   to the house. You size the house to the solar panels that you purchase. So, you're not going
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:48:01.540]   to have your whole house AC system running, because that is like 5 kilowatt hours, 5 kilowatts
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:10.660]   of electricity at 240 volts. And that's an awful lot of panels being installed over an
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   awful lot of surface area. So, you just aren't going to have it the way you think you're
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:27.140]   going to have it. You're going to be living like the clamp-its. You're going to have to
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:34.220]   buy a very efficient refrigerator. One of the brands is called Sunfrost. You may not
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:39.620]   even have a freezer. You're going to have all LED lighting throughout the house. And
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:44.020]   even then, you're going to turn them on and off when you're not using them. You're not
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:51.020]   going to have a 70-inch TV screen going, maybe not even a 42-inch. You're going to be real
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:58.100]   miserly with all of your energy usage. You're going to have a battery bank. You've got to
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:05.420]   monitor your battery bank and have a computer on it and know how many times you've discharged
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:11.500]   it to 50% depth of discharge, how many times you've gone down to 80. Because discharging
[01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:16.740]   a battery actually hurts the battery. And batteries are rated on the number of discharges
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:19.180]   they can take to a certain depth of discharge.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.340]   So, is it better if I have the opportunity to always keep my cell phone plugged in? Will
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.140]   that make the battery last longer?
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:24.740]   Yes.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.300]   Okay. I've always wondered about that, and I've never known how to figure out the answer.
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.500]   Okay. So, keep going. Sorry, I interrupted you.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:38.100]   So, you're going to become a little guru on your solar power independent system, and you're
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:44.580]   going to learn all about batteries and charging and electrolytes and watering the batteries
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:49.380]   and your inverter and what you're running in your house. And you'll be yelling at your
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:55.660]   kids saying, "Turn off that light!" and everything else. So, you're just not going to put solar
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:02.660]   panels up on your house and expect to live the same way that you are living right now.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:06.900]   That embedded energy thing is interesting. I'll have to research that more. I'm a total
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:13.900]   novice when it comes to this area, but I'm generally skeptical of most of what I read.
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:21.100]   I'll give you an example. I think recycling programs are extremely stupid in the way that
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:29.740]   they're run. Every Monday morning, the recycling truck comes down my road, and I look at this
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:35.700]   plastic bin of plastic that it picks up. My wife and I dutifully put our little blue bin
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:42.700]   in, and we put the stuff in. I think, "How is this even relevant at all to make a difference?"
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:47.620]   Recycling is me using my milk container for another purpose. That makes sense to me. The
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:53.340]   rest of this just seems like a bunch of crap. Why can't you just make the package, create
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:57.740]   the products and don't surround them with so much plastic? If I could buy it without
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:01.260]   the plastic and get cardboard that I could recycle in my backyard, that would be much
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:06.500]   more... I would do that. I look at these things, and half of them don't make sense. The solar
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.380]   thing bothers me, because I don't understand it very well. But if you tell me that it takes
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:14.900]   30 years to get the embedded energy out, then how is it even a gain? From an environmental
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:19.500]   perspective, if I've got so much embedded energy in it that I've got to get out, it's
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:25.460]   like the whole thing with buying a new hybrid car so that it's energy efficient. No, drive
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:30.500]   the old one that was already made and just drive it more carefully. If you need a new
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:34.260]   car, fine, go with one that's more efficient. That's totally different. But don't go out
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:39.100]   and do something new to get something better. Am I right? Am I wacky in that thinking? I
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:44.580]   don't have the engineering background. Recycling is done for only one reason. It makes the
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:50.540]   waste management company money. That's the only reason they do it, is because they make
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:54.300]   money off of it. You're going to have a war on your hand with that one. But I'm inclined
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:57.100]   to agree with you, just because it doesn't make sense to me when this guy with his big
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:03.260]   diesel truck goes... He's got to be paid a salary of, what, $30,000, $35,000 bucks a
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:07.020]   year, I don't know, every year to go pick up this blue bin. And I think, "How on earth
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:13.020]   can you get any energy out of this? It doesn't make sense." Well, the energy is already in
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:17.780]   the plastic. And it takes one-tenth of the energy to recycle the plastic as it does to
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:27.260]   make new plastic. And plastic is an extremely recyclable material. Steel is almost 100%
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:36.740]   recycled. Copper is like 80 or 90% recycled. Those are very, very recyclable items. And
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:45.860]   plastic recycles very well. Indeed, when you're putting it in the blue bin, or in our case,
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:56.020]   the blue garbage can, you're saving them on the sorting of it. They no longer have to
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:01.620]   sort it from the trash. All they have to do is separate the different types of plastic.
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:07.420]   There's like 10 different types of plastics you're throwing out. High-density polyethylene,
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:15.260]   low-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate. So they just have to separate those out and
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:20.260]   put those into different bins back at the recycling center. Then those can be chopped
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:29.060]   up and those plastics can be resold, cleaned up, and reused. But it's only being done for
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:35.180]   one reason, and that's because waste management, or whoever your company is, they make money
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:40.660]   on it. They sell it. And it makes people feel good. And I just say, eliminate the whole
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:48.100]   thing. My wife and I, we eat a lot of eggs. We mainly shop at Publix, although there is
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:52.860]   not a single carton of eggs that I can buy that has a cardboard container. And I think,
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:58.300]   how ridiculous to make an egg container out of plastic when I can't reuse it in any way.
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:02.420]   And why can't, when a cardboard one seems to work just as well to me, and then I can
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:09.540]   put that out in my garden and mulch my flowers with it and take care of my trash myself.
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:13.740]   Because styrofoam containers can be made at the egg location.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:16.020]   Is that what it is?
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:22.900]   You bring in a big truck full of polystyrene beads, which are like the size of BBs, and
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:29.860]   then they're inflated with steam and pressure, and it creates the carton right then and there
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:36.820]   on the location. They don't have to bring in, your volume is going ten to one. One is
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:42.260]   being brought in, and ten volume is going out because it's inflated. If you brought
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:47.060]   in all the paper to make paper egg cartons, you're bringing in a volume of one for a volume
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:53.420]   of one going out. Or you're bringing in the cartons pre-made and everything else.
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:57.460]   And think of the number of eggs that they're handling and everything else. It makes more
[01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:04.380]   economic sense for them to do that type of cartoning at that location because it's under
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:09.940]   their own control. And think of how expensive it would be to bring in a semi-truck full
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:17.500]   of styrofoam egg cartons, rather than just making them on that site, on that location.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:21.580]   But if we're going to subsidize it, we should subsidize it in that way. So subsidize that
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:27.620]   truck going there with that. You make the cardboard out of paper. Paper is the ultimate
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:31.620]   new renewable resource. You're growing trees. Everyone says that's what you want to do.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:36.300]   You were supposed to be growing trees. What eliminates carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:41.220]   better than anything else is the trees. So why do we subsidize... I don't understand
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:47.060]   the... I apologize. I'm displaying my ignorance. It's just so much doesn't make sense and I
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:52.260]   can't figure out how to get a straight answer from the people that know about this stuff.
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:59.060]   Well, first of all, there's no such thing as man-made global warming. The science is
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:06.060]   clear. The sun's output is up. What drives everything on this planet? The sun. The sun's
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:12.700]   output is up, so our temperature is up. It's not because of our CO2. That's, again, just
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:22.900]   guilt motivation. Throw yourself on your sword. Give money. Be green. Do this. Do that. Change
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:33.820]   industries all over this incredible fallacy that's being perpetrated upon us. So, yeah,
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:41.140]   these trees... you know what eats carbon dioxide is crops. Because of our CO2 increase, we
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:48.620]   are actually having more and better crops grown every year because it's like, what happens
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:55.420]   if you eat two helpings of steak every day? You're going to get fat. What happens when
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:02.780]   you have more carbon dioxide? Every carbon atom in you, you're organic, so you're pretty
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:12.820]   much C6H10O5 out of your atoms in your body. Organic cellulose. So, you know where all
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:19.180]   that carbon comes from that is the building block of your body that gives you structure?
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:24.500]   Where all that comes from? That all comes from carbon dioxide in the air. That's the
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:32.620]   only source. Carbon dioxide in the air through photosynthesis is what grows plants. It's
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:39.860]   what makes the carbon in the plant that gives it its structure for its organic molecules
[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:46.900]   that makes it grow. Now, when the cow... now, you eat your lettuce, you're eating that plant
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:52.620]   and you're getting its carbon. When you have a cow that eats the grass that was grown by
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:57.740]   the carbon dioxide, and then you eat the cow, you're getting the carbon from the cow. But
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:05.980]   the root source of every piece of carbon that is grown in this world is carbon dioxide.
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:14.780]   Someday we're going to have to do another show and you can be my back pocket scientist
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:21.940]   because science is my weak subject. I went through all the science classes and the standard
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:27.860]   kind of curriculum, but I just didn't enjoy them. And now I wish I had spent more time
[01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:34.260]   studying it because I often find myself unable to actually translate things very well. And
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:39.380]   so I have to rely on what I can look at, which is kind of human behavior a little bit, and
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:44.460]   then I use that. But, I mean, there's just so much it doesn't seem to make sense when
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:49.580]   I look at it. And you make good points. Maybe we'll do that another time.
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:56.540]   Yeah, think about it. Everything you're breathing right now builds the world. If you didn't
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:59:02.420]   mine it from the ground, then it was made with carbon dioxide that you're breathing
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:03.420]   out right now.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.700]   Interesting. I've never thought about it in that way.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.700]   That's a hell of a statement.
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.620]   Yeah. I've never thought about it in that way.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:17.780]   That cardboard box your eggs came in was made with carbon dioxide from the air.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.900]   What a fun thing to think about. Wow.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:27.340]   The paper you're writing on, the plastic in your computer was not, but the paper you're
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:33.020]   writing on was. The toilet paper you wipe your rear end with, that comes from carbon
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:41.420]   dioxide. It comes from trees. I mean, when you start looking at the tree that all the
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:48.500]   science comes from, it's just absolutely fascinating. It puts things in perspective and makes you
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:53.660]   do exactly what you did. You say, "Wow. I didn't realize that. I didn't think about
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:59.620]   that." Too often, these environmentalists and people of any political motivation, they
[01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:06.020]   want you to look at an issue through a toilet paper tube and only see that issue. They don't
[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:10.860]   want you to see the big picture and the whole picture. They don't think you're intelligent
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:20.900]   enough to understand the whole operating system that's going on, that's affecting the issue.
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:24.260]   They just want you to look at it through this one narrow point, because they think that
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:28.380]   that's all they can sell you. That's all that you can digest.
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:33.420]   It's the same in all of our society. If I do that with finance, I can bamboozle anybody
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:43.660]   in the world on anything if I just focus on one specific issue. I know my finance, and
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:49.940]   so you give me any product. I can make it sound like it's going to fit somebody's situation,
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:53.700]   or I can make it sound like it's the worst thing in the world, all based upon how I present
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:01:01.000]   the information. It's not an ethical way to approach it.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.720]   Those of us who know our subjects, our job is to teach people how to think about things
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:11.600]   in the aggregate and help people build a holistic framework so that then they can look at the
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.000]   individual issue and say, "Here's what it is." But it's like everything in our society
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.640]   is so compartmentalized and segmented, and people feel like they need an expert. Well,
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:26.440]   they do, because they're taught that nothing is connected, and I see everything as connected.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:29.440]   It's all connected. It is.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:33.320]   Thank you for coming on today. I've really enjoyed this. I do want to real quick give
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:39.160]   a plug. You who created a resource that is one of the most valuable resources that I've
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:45.960]   sent to many people here in hurricane country, you have a family of class on family preparedness,
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:49.600]   and you've done a lot of work. I've listened to all of your shows. I think you've done
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:55.040]   10 or 15 shows or something with Jack Spierko over on his show, The Survival Podcast, on
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:01.440]   energy, on home energy. I have found the work that you've created to be incredibly useful,
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.360]   and especially your emergency preparedness class as far as just figuring out how do I
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:12.120]   prepare my family for an intelligent—for us, it's hurricane season. How do I prepare
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:15.760]   for hurricane season? For you guys, maybe it's ice or tornado season or whatever you
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:21.440]   deal with up there. Where can people go if they want to read more of your stuff? Plug
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.720]   your websites and your preparedness class and make sure people can find out more information.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:31.280]   Okay. In my family class, I will teach you everything you could possibly want to know
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.080]   about food and water. I'm not going to tell you to go out and buy MREs or buy freeze-dried
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:44.720]   food. Everything in my class is around white flour, oil, sugar, water. I will have you
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.040]   making emergency bread, white flour tortillas, in 30 seconds.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:52.040]   And doughnuts. I made the doughnuts.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:58.040]   And doughnuts. I have this class and people go, "Okay, emergency food time." They go,
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:03.160]   "Okay, what are we going to eat?" I go, "Doughnuts." "No, no, an emergency. What are we really
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:11.040]   going to eat?" "Doughnuts." And they're going, "Yay!" I'm going to say, cooking in oil is
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:17.440]   a very fast way of cooking. You're taking heat in the form of a flame, you're putting
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:23.120]   it in a pot, it's going into oil, and your food is going directly into that oil. So it's
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:29.120]   getting cooked very quickly and very fast because the oil is in contact with it.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:35.120]   And I take these recipes for Indian fry bread and naan and everything else, and they're
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:41.880]   just simple white flour recipes, and I show you how to put it on top of a skillet and
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:48.560]   cook it that way and eat it, or I show you how to put it into the hot oil and fry it,
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:54.720]   and it comes out real delicious. Put a little cinnamon and sugar on it, and you're going
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:00.200]   to be loving it. And people go, "What about nutrition and everything? It's not nutritious."
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:08.000]   And my response to them is, "Shut up and take a multivitamin. One penny a day multivitamin
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.680]   will give you all of the nutrition you want." When you're in a disaster, you need calories.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:19.520]   You need calories to walk. You need calories to lift up your destroyed house and start
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:26.320]   rebuilding it. You need calories to find other people, and you need calories to keep warm
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:31.600]   or to keep cool. You need calories in a disaster. And I address that real intelligently in the
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:33.840]   family class.
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.440]   Then I have how to power your house from your car, which is so simple. You take an inverter,
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:44.000]   you plug it into your car. I go over all the details of what the car can and cannot power
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.600]   inside your house. Will it do your refrigerator? Will it do your freezer? I have another class
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:55.120]   on how to keep your refrigerator and freezer cool with and without electricity. I tell
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:59.920]   you very intelligent things you can do before a disaster, like with hurricanes three days
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:05.440]   out. I tell you how you put stuff in your freezer that will keep it cool, so you don't
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:11.000]   have to worry about it that long. I have a class on how to buy a generator. There's seven
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.720]   main types of generators out there. I cover each one, so you can make a decision on which
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.160]   one you want. I tell you how to hook up your generator to your house, both the illegal
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:24.800]   and the legal ways, the safe and the unsafe ways. That way, if your neighbor goes, "Hey,
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:29.320]   George! I got my generator running over here. You want some power? I can plug this into
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:33.880]   your dryer outlet, and your house will be powered." Well, you'll know right away that
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:40.160]   that's called a suicide cable, and you'll know what to do if you want to plug your house
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.320]   into your neighbor's generator to do that. You might say, "No, that's too dangerous for
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:50.760]   me. I don't want to do that." Or you might have a mother-in-law with you who has oxygen
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:54.920]   that runs off an oxygen pump that runs off electricity. You might be real desperate for
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:06:00.480]   electricity. "Yeah, I'm going to do that. I'm going to take that risk. I know to turn
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:05.960]   off the main breakers, turn off the generator, plug everything in, and then turn on the generator."
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:13.520]   I explain that to you so you're enabled intellectually to make those decisions. I have my battery
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:19.360]   bank classes, how to go buy a marine battery or golf cart batteries and then put them in
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:24.360]   your house so when the power fails, you got your own little power station there. It'll
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:28.560]   power all your electronics and everything for as long as you want. I show you how to
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:33.440]   recharge this off of your car. I show you how to recharge this off of a generator. I
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:40.440]   even begrudgingly show you how to re-power this off of solar panels. My take on solar
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:44.520]   panels is you should never buy a solar panel until you have at least three months of food
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:48.920]   and water storage. Because what's the purpose of having a solar panel that will power your
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:54.840]   phone for 50 years and you only got five days worth of food and water. Your money is much
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:07:01.040]   better spent on the food and water. You can power your house for about two months plus
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:07.080]   off of your car with stored gasoline, which leads to another class I have called fuel
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:16.000]   and fuel storage. I show you how to fill up 15-gallon HDPE food-grade containers with
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.640]   gasoline and store them. They're stored real safe and not smelly and everything else rather
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:30.000]   than using those horrible 5-gallon gasoline containers. I have a lot more. I have a good
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:45.520]   12 classes up there. You can find them all at Stephen1234.com. That's www.steven1234.com.
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:51.160]   It's all free. You can just go up there and with one click you can listen to any of the
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:59.040]   classes. Stephen1234 will lead you to solar1234 and battery1234. First Aid1234. I got a great
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:04.440]   first aid course that the Red Cross would never ever dare give you. It will lead you
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:15.040]   to radios1234. It's everything about communications, scanners, CVs, ham radio, GMRS, FRS, anything
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:20.160]   that was a radio, AMF from shortwave. It teaches you everything that you could ever possibly
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:29.440]   want to know about radios. Stephen1234.com is the hub to all the other 1234 websites.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:35.520]   Up there I got all the people send me the best comments and the nicest endorsements
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:42.040]   and I put those up on Stephen1234. You can see right then and there what other people
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:49.600]   have said about the classes and stuff that I've done and hopefully get you excited and
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:55.600]   enabled and listening to them. Hopefully it will be of great assistance to you both in
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:01.960]   your financial future and in your disaster future. Let's face it, an ounce of prevention,
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:08.680]   a few dollars in disaster prevention can save you thousands of dollars when a disaster comes
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:14.720]   by. I can literally make the difference. With some of my power classes and how to power
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:22.840]   your house from a car, I can make your house very livable in a complete blackout and you'll
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:28.640]   be able to tolerate it for a couple weeks easily. Now what would a couple weeks in a
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:36.440]   hotel a hundred miles away from you cost? It's massive. Yeah, at least a hundred dollars
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:48.320]   a day. So there's $1400 to $2000 in saved money for less than $100 spent at home.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:55.040]   Right. I mean I've been, I got my ham radio license when I think I was, before I was a
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:59.840]   teenager or something like I was 12 and so ever since then, so for I said almost 20 years,
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:05.440]   almost 20 years, I was a member of Aries and I've been through the hurricanes and just
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.960]   the ability to be at home after the, you know, maybe you got to evacuate for a storm, but
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.900]   just the ability to stay at home and not have to, you know, and you can't stay at home unless
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:18.240]   you have an ability to, you know, stay a little cool and have some light. It just is not livable
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:22.320]   in Florida and it's not livable anywhere even if you don't have a way to stay cool or stay
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:27.200]   warm and have some food. And the thing that I'll say about your stuff, and I just want
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:33.400]   to thank you for it, is that it is practical, it's doable, it's cheap, and it's easy. And
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.600]   so every time I see something, whether it's, you know, as mundane as, okay, it's, you know,
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:43.040]   it's June, it's time for hurricane season, or as extreme as, you know, what's going on
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:47.560]   right now as we record this on October 17th, you know, we're dealing with Ebola and for
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:53.280]   some reason it's just like massive news everywhere. That can strike just like every single thing.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:59.560]   You're dealing not necessarily with facts, you're dealing with an emotion, and if this
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:05.560]   thing is not quieted down, it could be stupid. And so when someone's worried about it, though,
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:09.840]   if they figure out, okay, I've got to go buy 800 pounds of wheat that I don't know what
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:14.640]   to do with versus Stephen Harris says, "Go buy some flour, some sugar, and some oil."
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:17.640]   And when I first heard that class, I went straight to the grocery store, I bought white
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.640]   flour, sugar, and oil, and I went home and made donuts for my family. And it works. And
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:28.280]   you say, "Okay, well, I can at least have a plan B in case this hysteria, you know,
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.960]   takes off." And so it works. So thank you for putting the work into those shows, and
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:37.520]   I'd encourage people, go to Stephen1234 and check them all out. They're all worth listening
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.400]   to. And if there's a pandemic, whether it's Ebola,
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:49.440]   bird flu, SARS, something's going to come along and be widespread in the United States
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:55.200]   at some point. The best way to catch it is not to be around anyone who's got it. So if
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:01.040]   you've got enough food to stay in your house for a month or two, and just knock at, if
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.760]   someone knocks at the door, you go to the door and go, "Uh-uh, you can't come in, sorry.
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:11.720]   I'm not letting you in because I don't want to be exposed." That is something that you
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:18.000]   can do if you are prepared, and it'll keep you prepared from all of the disasters, all
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.840]   of the pandemics, because you don't have to go out and leave. You don't have to go out
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:25.880]   to the grocery store. You don't have to get a grocery cart that 100 other people have
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:29.760]   touched. You don't have to go pick up food and packages that other people had to handle
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.960]   and touch to put them there. You don't have to go use the ATM that absolutely everyone
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:40.720]   has used at the checkout. You don't have to use the pen that everyone has used to sign
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:45.480]   for your credit card on a little electronic screen. And you don't get exposed to all those
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:51.160]   people around you. You don't have to have masks and goggles and everything on you to
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:57.520]   do that, because you got your food and your water and your power at home. It's under your
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:04.440]   own control, therefore you own it, and therefore you can exercise it at your free will without
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:10.080]   the permission from anyone, and you are prepared and you are a heck of a lot safer.
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:17.040]   Right. And this is core to every bit of financial planning, whether it's core. It's absolutely
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:21.640]   core, and it's what allows people to be free-thinking if you're not dependent on other people and
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:27.120]   you can look and care for yourself. Steven, thank you for coming on. I have really enjoyed
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:32.080]   this and I think we've created a valuable resource. I appreciate your time and I appreciate
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:39.440]   your being willing to come on the show. Well, thanks, Joshua. It was a pleasure being here.
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:42.880]   And that's the interview. Told you it'd be fun. And hopefully that's a good start. I
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:46.840]   know this is an area where I have very little background in. I have very little experience,
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.320]   so I need to really seek out people who know what they're doing and seek out experts on
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:56.600]   the subject. And I feel like I've got a better game plan as I get started on my renovations.
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.560]   We're going into the cool season here in South Florida, so now is the time where I think
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.640]   I'll be able to get some better deals on various aspects of saving money on insulation.
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:12.520]   Real quick, I want to give one plug for the emergency preparedness information that Steve
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:18.840]   went over, which you can find all of this at, I think it said steven1234.com. Make sure
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:26.240]   you go and check out his site, steven1234.com. Steve has really done an amazing job with
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:34.760]   extremely practical and easily implementable emergency preparedness, family emergency preparedness
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:40.920]   from that perspective. I have sent his resources to many people as being extremely practical.
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:44.000]   I live in hurricane country, some of you live in earthquake country, some of you live in
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.040]   winter ice storm country. And the trouble when you start getting into thinking how can
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:56.280]   I prepare my family for some sort of natural disaster, some sort of weather event, some
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:01.680]   sort of power outage, things like that, it can be very overwhelming because there's so
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:06.920]   much information out there that you could tackle. You've got everything from the advice
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:13.000]   of have a flashlight in your house to everything to here's how to survive the end of the world
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:19.200]   as we know it for the next 10 years and live off the grid and build a battle hardened castle.
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.880]   And it's really overwhelming when you get into that. And the challenge is that if you're
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:29.160]   just starting to figure out how to build out an emergency preparedness plan for yourself,
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:35.920]   you've got to do it in a practical, low cost way that is focusing on what actually matters
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:42.680]   first. You don't immediately, I mean, you don't go out and start buying guns and bullets
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:47.120]   when what you really need is a flashlight and some rechargeable batteries.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:53.280]   Steve's resources, which you can find them all at steven1234. The resources that he has
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:16:00.240]   put together are so practical and they are awesome. Everything works, everything is cheap,
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:06.120]   and it's incredibly detailed. He has incredibly detailed explanations. Start with his family
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:09.840]   emergency preparedness class. I'll put a direct link to that. Start with that. It's about
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:16.200]   a two hour class that he delivered to, I think it was a CERT group. CERT stands for Civil
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:21.640]   Emergency Response Team, which is a response team that your local county or municipal government
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:27.200]   may have. It's a volunteer association. I haven't been involved with CERT myself personally.
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:32.320]   I've always been involved on the communication side with amateur radio and all that and past
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:37.640]   work. But CERT is just a volunteer aspect. But he was doing a CERT training. And you
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:43.840]   will find in that training the cheapest, most straightforward, practical advice on how to
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.160]   prepare your family in case of a tornado or hurricane, an ice storm, something like that.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:51.960]   That moves on to, then the next place you'll want to go is, well, you'll want to start
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:57.160]   at steven1234. That will send you over to his site called solar1234. And on that site,
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:04.160]   he has listed on there seven free classes. And there is an incredible amount of information
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:08.880]   there. He has a class called How to Power Your House from Your Car, which he mentioned.
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:12.120]   That's the key place to start if you don't want to have a big, noisy generator. You already
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:16.040]   have one. It's sitting in your driveway. And he gives specific instructions for how you
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:23.120]   can get a cheap inverter and you can use your car to run your refrigerator and your freezer.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.640]   The coolest thing about it is I watched, he has testimonials on his site of when Hurricane
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:30.760]   Sandy was coming toward New York City. And there's millions of people that are going
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:35.400]   to be affected. You could go on, if you knew a hurricane were coming to your area, you
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:41.920]   could go on solar1234, follow his recommendations, order everything for next day delivery from
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:48.040]   Amazon, spend 100 or 200 bucks, and you would be far ahead of anything else, as far as,
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:53.960]   of everybody else, as far as being able to stay in your house. And this is an incredibly,
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:59.840]   incredibly important aspect of financial preparedness. Because as he mentioned toward the end of
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:04.400]   the show, if you can save money on not having to evacuate your family for two weeks because
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:09.480]   there's a hurricane coming. Now again, there's a category five direct hit, get out. You know,
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:13.560]   have some common sense. But I've been through a bunch of these things. And if you don't
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:20.000]   have the ability to live comfortably for a week or two without power in Florida, that's
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:26.680]   expensive. So it's a very important aspect of financial preparedness, of financial planning,
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:32.000]   is just some basic, straightforward family preparedness. This is one of those areas,
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.680]   just like getting your will established and just like buying life insurance. This is one
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:42.720]   of those areas where we're all told constantly to take care of things. And go to ready.gov
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.000]   is the government website. Your state, your county, all of this has their own website.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.440]   But you still see that in our society, when there's a storm coming, the gas lines get
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:57.560]   long, the shelves empty out. Now is the time to do it before the storm comes. So I always,
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.760]   you know, I've said in a recent show, I did a show on preparedness as a mindset. When
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:05.280]   we get to the end of hurricane season, which is what's coming up for us, then that's the
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.200]   time to sit down and say, "Okay, how did everything go this season? Do I need to do anything different?"
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.840]   I had a bit of an advantage that I was paying attention to that from a very young age because
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:19.240]   I always enjoyed being involved in emergency response and preparedness from the communications
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:27.120]   aspect as a hobby when I was younger. And so that helped a lot. But I've noticed that
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.760]   in many ways, financial planning, good financial planning and financial preparedness is very
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:37.320]   much about simply avoiding the big mistakes. So I want to really commend his emergency
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:43.640]   preparedness resources to you. He's done a bunch of shows on that and he has some awesome
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:48.200]   information there and awesome classes. So you'll find all that at Steven1234. I encourage
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.120]   you to start there with your own personal emergency preparedness information. A little
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:57.920]   bit different than what we're talking about energy savings, but I encourage you to start
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:03.400]   there. That's it for today's show. I know that outro was a little bit long, but I wanted
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:08.960]   to share that resource with you and the best way to do it was in the context of what Steve
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.640]   has already created. I'd love to hear about any projects that you've done. I want this
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:19.680]   show to be a really great mix of the practical and I want to have a lot of practical, actionable
[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:28.240]   information. Concept theory is valuable in many aspects, but remember concept and theory
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:36.560]   is only part of it and practical application is another part of it. So in my goal of creating
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:40.800]   a show that you can come back to every single day, I don't want to overwhelm you with a
[02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:44.760]   bunch of academic theory every day. I want there to be something that will go between
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:49.760]   academic theory and very practical application. So I'm going to be out shopping for a water
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:53.920]   heater because I need to get one to swap out my homeowner's insurance. I got to get a new
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:57.520]   one. So now I have a better place to start and that helped me a lot. Maybe that will
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:02.600]   help you as well. If you know of people like Stephen Harris that you think would be an
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:07.840]   excellent source of information that would have practical information, I would love to
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:12.400]   get that resource from you. I'd really love to hear from you about that. You all can help
[02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:17.580]   me so much. I've had a number of people as guests recommended from the show. I have plenty
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:21.360]   of people on my list, but as the show has been growing and as the audience has been
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:25.320]   growing, I would ask you for your help. If you know of somebody that you think would
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:30.800]   be an interesting guest that would have some valuable information, please send me an email
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:36.280]   about them and I'll contact them or if they're a friend of yours, ask them to get in touch
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:41.880]   with me because I want to make sure that this show is packed with value for you every single
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:47.560]   day. So that's it for today's show. I hope you enjoyed that. Make sure if you're not
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:52.240]   subscribed to the show, make sure you subscribe in iTunes or on Stitcher. Those are probably
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:57.400]   the two easiest apps to use or whatever app it is that you use. We'd love to have your
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:01.360]   reviews on Stitcher. If you're a Stitcher listener, we haven't been getting many reviews
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:05.240]   of the show there. I would love to ask you to go to Stitcher and leave a review on the
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:19.200]   show. That would mean the world to me. Thanks everybody. Have a great Tuesday.
