[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   And our first one today comes from Sabine.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Sabine asks, "When you're in the stage of building career capital,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   is it worth becoming good at skills that you would like to eventually stop using?"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So if we go on to the elaboration here, Sabine says,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   "I still have four years to study until I can legally be allowed to be hired
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   in my ideal work. In my current situation,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   fundraising is a skill that would allow me to get access to the niche expert sooner
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   so I could easily find out their stories, how they got where they are now,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and what skills I should focus on to become so good I can't be ignored."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   So the basic idea here is Sabine does not want to be a fundraiser long-term,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   but in the current situation, that skill would be useful to be good at,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   could open up access to people from which learning could be done.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I would say a moderate yes is probably my answer here.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   By a moderate yes, I mean it's completely reasonable as part of your career journey
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   to build up skills in the moment that are very valuable at this current stage
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   just as part of your efforts to differentiate yourself as reliable,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   someone who can deliver, someone who is valuable.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   That's always a good thing.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And if one of the primary ways you can do this in your current position is fundraising,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I think it's fine. Let's do this well. Let's get good at it.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   However, the reason why I say this is a moderate yes is that there is a big trap lurking.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   If you're really good at getting good at things, and listeners to this podcast probably are
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   because we talk about it all the time and we talk about deliberate practice,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   you might start to get really good at this.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And when you start to get really good at something like fundraising,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   that is where you're going to be directed, and you're going to get a lot of praise for it,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and more importantly, you're going to get a lot of money for it,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and you're going to get a lot of cool positions, and you're going to have that momentum behind you,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and it can be difficult to then say, "That was just temporary.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   What I really want to do is this completely unrelated skill."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   When things are going well, it's difficult to move off of that path.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Now, in my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You," I talk about this.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I call it one of the two autonomy traps.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   The first autonomy trap is trying to make a bid for a lot more autonomy in your work
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   before you have the skills to back it up.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So this is the classic 22-year-old saying, "I'm going to go out on my own
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and start my nonprofit that's going to save the world,"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   the problem being you don't have the skills or the understanding or the connection
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   to actually run an effective nonprofit yet.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   The second autonomy trap, which is what's relevant here, is that once you actually get to a place
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   where you have the career capital to have a lot of control, you're so good at what you do
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   that there's going to be incredible pressure to keep doing it.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   We might as well call this the law partner trap.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It happens a lot to lawyers.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You come out of a good school.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   What do I do now? I'm smart. I'm accomplished.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   How do I keep proving to the world I'm good?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Oh, law school is hard to do. Okay, I'll go to law school.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Look, everyone's impressed. I got into Harvard Law.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   This is very impressive. Okay, great.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Oh, I did well in law school. I know how to do this.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Look, I'm getting praise. That's great.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I got a job in a big law firm. Those are competitive.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I have a big paycheck.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   They're starting me. My first year associate salary is $170,000.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   That's a lot. I feel good.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   People know unambiguously that I'm impressive.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Okay, I'm going to try to do my work well.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Okay, hey, I'm getting more cases. Hey, I'm about to go for partner.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Well, that would be really prestigious.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Here we go. Now it's seven years later.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'm partner. I'm high six figures, low seven-figure salary.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And wait a second. I am completely stuck here.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I've just been following this path getting better and better
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   because that's what I'm used to doing.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And now I realize I'm working 100 hours a week and miserable.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And what can I do? We have a lifestyle that's built around this.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   There's no easy transference of the skills.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And now I'm just sad.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's the second autonomy trap.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So there's a long way of saying be wary of that.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Sure, do what you're doing now well.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's always better to be doing what you're doing well than be doing it wrong.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Be reliable. Deliver.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Deliver at high levels of quality.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I always give that advice to people who are new in their career.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But I would start right away thinking about what are ultimately the skills
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   that you can build the long career on,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   the skills that are going to give you those interesting options.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Once you actually get good at it, have that in mind right away
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and try to get that parallel track going right away.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Because I got to tell you, things that are valuable,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   if you start doing them at a high level,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   they will get sucked into a path in which you are being pushed
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   with great force to keep doing that at a higher and higher level.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So do what you do well, but be wary about only working on a skill
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   that you really don't want to do.
