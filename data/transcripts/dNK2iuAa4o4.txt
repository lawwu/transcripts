[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - We're honored to be joined again
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.920]   by author and speaker Paul Tripp,
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.560]   the author of the book Sex and Money.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.040]   And we could do a whole week on money issues,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.900]   but we have one day, so here it is.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.920]   What are some symptoms of a life
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.480]   that is ruled by a love of money?
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.400]   What are some prompts that should alert us
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000]   to this sin in our own hearts?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.480]   - Well, that's a huge, huge question.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   The love of money is deeper than,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.360]   I like to hold it in my hands, I like to smell it,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.040]   I like to have a fat wallet.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.680]   It's really about, love of money is about contentment,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.640]   love of money is about humility,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   love of money is about identity,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.720]   love of money is about worship,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.240]   that it really roots in deep issues.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.240]   Maybe, maybe the most subtle of the indicators
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   of love of money is an ongoing chronic discontentment in me,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.320]   that no matter what I have, I'm still not content.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.160]   And maybe the biggest sign in the church
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.160]   of our discontent is debt, debt.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.600]   It is shocking the amount of debt
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.400]   that the individual Christian is in.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.400]   If you could view the average debt load
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   of the average Christian, you would be amazed.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.680]   And if that debt load could be removed,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.560]   how much more flexibility would we have to participate in
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.920]   and to give to the larger agenda of God's kingdom?
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.400]   We now have a system called credit cards
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.160]   where we can actually spend money we don't have.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   It is an act of disobedience
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.640]   to put something on a credit card
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.840]   that you could not afford with cash,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.080]   or that you do not have a plan to pay by cash,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   a reasonable plan, because you are now taking sovereignty
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.680]   and ownership over your money well-being.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.640]   Well, no one has that.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.040]   Only God has that.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.920]   Only God knows what he's gonna provide for you tomorrow.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280]   And in places outside of something like a house
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.400]   where you don't have any choice,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.640]   I think we're doing that all the time.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.080]   We're spending what we have no reasonable expectation
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.160]   to be able to pay.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.000]   Why?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.720]   Because our hearts are discontent,
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.160]   and we're hoping that money will purchase for us
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.040]   contentment of heart.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.380]   And it will never do that
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.760]   because it's not the role of money.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.840]   So we love money because we think money
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.340]   is a pathway to contentment, and it's just not.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.000]   Because money can't buy contentment.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It can buy you stuff, but it can't buy you contentment.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.880]   - Yes, amen.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.520]   And there's so much more to say on money, debt, and giving.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.720]   We could do a whole entire week of podcasts just on this,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.840]   but our time is coming to an end.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.800]   So for more, see Paul Tripp's book,
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.560]   Sex and Money, published by Crossway.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.000]   I highly commend the book.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.720]   And I wanna finish out our time together
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.560]   talking about parenting.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.120]   And tomorrow, Paul, I wanna ask you a very basic question.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.680]   What is the goal of day in and day out
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.500]   parenting investments that we are making in our children?
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.340]   I'll ask tomorrow.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.980]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.140]   (silence)
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.300]   (silence)
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.460]   (silence)
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:54.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
