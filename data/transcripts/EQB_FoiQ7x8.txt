[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   Well, I hope you had a wonderful Christmas celebration.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.440]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.120]   Thanks for listening.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.400]   Our next question is complex and mysterious.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.360]   A lot of them are, but it comes in the form of a rather simple question, which is, "Where
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.680]   is heaven right now?"
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.840]   It's a question from Eleanor in London.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.360]   My kids want to know, and I don't know how to explain the answer to them of this question.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.680]   Where is heaven presently located, and are there any indications we have from Scripture
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.440]   to answer that question?"
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:46.880]   When we pray, "Our Father who art in heaven," we are implying that heaven, at least in one
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.240]   of its most common uses, is where God the Father is.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:01.360]   Now, one of the most basic things we know, and kids know, about God is that he created
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.600]   everything that is not God.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.600]   Before creation, there was no material universe.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.280]   Given what we know now about space and time, we can say that before the creation of the
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.680]   material universe, the world, there was no space and no time.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.800]   Albert Einstein causes us to know this.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:34.280]   Three times, the apostle Paul refers to God's activity before the ages.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.240]   For example, 1 Corinthians 2.7, "We impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.920]   decreed before the ages."
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.440]   Now, "ages" is the biblical term for seasons of time.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.000]   It's the biblical writers knew it—ages.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.520]   And before that, God was there.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.640]   So I think we can say with confidence that where God dwells is not a geographic place
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.600]   that we could go to in a spaceship, nor does it have spatial dimensions as we know them.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.960]   So if heaven is where God dwells, heaven is not technically a place in the sense that
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.640]   we usually think about places.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.320]   Wherever God was when he created the universe, understanding that wherever is a very inexact
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.460]   and inappropriate use of the word, wherever he was, that's where he is now, outside
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.720]   the universe in a dimension of reality that is perfectly suited to his own being and existence.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.160]   And I think children can understand this.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.840]   I mean, there are aspects of it that adults can't understand, but I think children can
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   get this.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.880]   You don't have to use the relativity theory in order to explain it.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.560]   They understand once there was nothing but God.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Nothing.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   Nothing.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   No spatial dimension at all.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   There was no up.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   There was no down.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   There was no sideways.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.920]   There was no diagonal.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.160]   The only reality was God.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.440]   That's the only reality there was.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.520]   And we're not pantheists.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.480]   He wasn't filling anything.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.240]   He was just God.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.980]   It was just the most boggling fact in the universe, outside the universe.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.600]   The fact that anything else exists is because God made it, which means it is not God.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.960]   It is different from God, and he is outside it, distinct from everything he made.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.440]   That's where heaven is, outside the created material universe as we know it.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.520]   That's maybe why the Bible says at least eight times that God is exalted above the heavens.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.040]   In other words, whatever is the highest heaven you can imagine—or we might say galaxies,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.160]   as far as you can put that Hubble telescope out there to the edge of the universe—God
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.760]   is beyond that, above that, under that, over that, outside that, and that is the highest
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.720]   and true heaven, the above all created material universe heaven and the dwelling place of
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   God.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.240]   However, there's a catch that complicates things, right?
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.920]   At the very heart of Christianity is the teaching of the incarnation, that the eternal Son
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.280]   of God, who was with God and was God for all eternity past, was not part of creation.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.660]   He always was.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.000]   He was not made.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.160]   Nevertheless, according to John 1:14, following, he was made flesh.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:01.000]   The uncreated God took on a human nature and a material physical body.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.660]   And not only that, but he rose physically and materially from the dead.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.800]   He was recognized by his friends in a resurrection body, and to prove that he wasn't a ghost,
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.880]   he ate fish in his resurrection body, Luke 24, 43.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.520]   And then he ascended into heaven, and the angel told the disciples who watched him go
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.800]   up, "This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.000]   you saw him go into heaven."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.880]   And Jesus said, "From now on, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   the power of God," which means that Jesus, even though he has a body, is with God in
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.280]   heaven, which is outside the material universe.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.360]   Now how can that be?
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760]   How can that be?
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:58.400]   If heaven is the place that is outside the created material realm where God is, how can
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.080]   Jesus be at his right hand with a body?
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.960]   And part of the answer may be what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 42.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.740]   What is sown in death is perishable.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.240]   What is raised is imperishable.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.120]   It is sown in dishonor.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.600]   It is raised in glory.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.720]   It is sown in weakness.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.960]   It is raised in power.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.560]   It is sown a natural body.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.360]   It is raised a spiritual body.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.720]   Hmm.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.900]   A spiritual body.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.680]   If there is a natural body, he says there is a spiritual body.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.320]   In other words, the resurrection body that we will have, because Jesus was the first
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.600]   fruits of our resurrection, so whatever was true of him is more or less true of us in
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   our resurrection.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.360]   It is not a merely natural, material, physical body.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   Merely.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   It is a body.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.000]   There is some kind of continuity with the bodies we have here, but it's different.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.720]   It's a spiritual body, and we do not know fully what a spiritual body is.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.360]   A spiritual body transcends, goes beyond, is above the ordinary experience of space.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.800]   You remember, Jesus could just seem to show up in unexpected ways after his resurrection.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.240]   He seemed to pass right through walls, and yet he was not a ghost.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.040]   He ate fish.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.320]   So we don't know what this is.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.400]   So my conclusion is that heaven is the place where God dwells.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.800]   It is also the place where the risen Christ dwells at God's right hand.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.240]   So Christ brings humanity, his own humanity, a created human nature, into the presence
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:53.360]   of God in a real, tangible way that exceeds all our ability to comprehend.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.840]   But the most important thing we can say about it, so far as our experience goes, is what
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:09.080]   Paul says in Philippians 1:23, that when we die, we depart to be with Christ, and that
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.440]   is far better.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:17.560]   Heaven for us, after death and before the resurrection, is to be with Christ, a thousand
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.880]   times better than anything here, and then at our resurrection, there will be a new heaven
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.920]   and a new earth where righteousness dwells, and heaven, the dwelling place of God, will
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.000]   come down, so to speak.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.200]   And in ways we cannot imagine, God will dwell among us and be our God.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Amen.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.360]   What a great meditation for this time of year.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.200]   And thanks for the question, Eleanor.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.880]   And to all of you, thank you for prayerfully supporting this podcast and praying for Pastor
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.160]   John and for me for the past five years, and for sending in questions and listening and
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.840]   being so engaged with what we do on the podcast.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.800]   As we enter our sixth year in just a few days, I want to give a shout out to all of you who
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.960]   also financially support the ministry.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.400]   You make this work possible, and we are very thankful to God that you have partnered with
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.360]   us for another year.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   Thank you.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.920]   And, of course, if you're interested in joining us as a financial partner, perhaps for the
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.200]   very first time, we would certainly appreciate it.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.480]   You can donate online anytime at DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.280]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.640]   Well new years bring new beginnings.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.880]   And on Friday, we hear from a woman who is ready to take the next steps towards finishing
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.160]   out her years on earth as a missionary.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.960]   So what are those first steps?
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.320]   I'll ask Pastor John that question next time.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.120]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
