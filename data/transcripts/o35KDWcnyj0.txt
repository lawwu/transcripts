[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   - All right, next question is from Rochelle.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.560]   I've been increasingly hardcore
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.540]   about implementing your advice recently,
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.160]   but I've encountered an unexpected side effect.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.800]   Some coworkers tell me that they actually prefer
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.040]   having many email check-ins and get angry
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.560]   when I jump the gun and start executing tasks.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.020]   How can I stay productive and sane without stepping on toes?
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.080]   - I know what you're talking about, Rochelle.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.540]   And I actually have a little bit of empathy for them.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.340]   Like, I understand their complaint.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.520]   Like, there's two things going on here.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.440]   They have maybe more of a hyperactive,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.040]   hive-mind approach to collaboration.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.520]   We'll just sort of figure things out back and forth
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.880]   with email, a slower approach.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.720]   And you're thinking like, let's just roll.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.600]   We're doing a meeting.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.280]   Let me just order the food, get the caterer going.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000]   I get that, but they also probably feel
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.580]   as if they're being cut out of a process
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.800]   or if mistakes are gonna be made
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.760]   because they haven't had a chance to talk to you.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.520]   And you ordered all the food,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.040]   but you didn't talk to them first
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.180]   and they could have told you
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.800]   that the guest who's coming to speak is vegetarian.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.480]   And so we need to order from this other place over there.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.300]   So they have legitimate reasons to want to actually
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.860]   have a chance to talk about things before action is taken.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.060]   So what we have to do is thread this needle,
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.760]   give people a chance to actually interact with you,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.280]   let these things unfold at a pace
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.940]   that they will follow as well
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.080]   without you being beholden to an inbox,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.460]   without you having to just sort of like
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.840]   always be sending emails and kind of doing things ad hoc
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.500]   like most people do.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.000]   So one thing I'm gonna suggest
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.360]   and the first part won't be that surprising,
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.800]   you figure out upfront, okay,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.480]   what are my responsibilities in this thing we're working on?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.000]   And figure out some sort of,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.960]   and this word's not gonna surprise you,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.280]   process by which you're gonna get that work done.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.200]   You kind of bring them up to speed.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.000]   Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.920]   I'll take care of the food for this meeting.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.360]   I'll take care of the conference room.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.880]   I'll take care of getting the promotional materials out.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.440]   Here is how I'm gonna do that.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.140]   And so you bring them up to speed right off the bat
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.000]   about when and how you're gonna do things
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.040]   so that they know the plan upfront,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.080]   you're moving it out of,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.440]   we'll just sort of rock and roll on the fly.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.280]   Two, when you send out this process
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.640]   for whatever collaborative project you're working on,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.560]   lean towards what I call feedback options
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.600]   versus feedback checkpoints.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.000]   So a feedback checkpoint is before I order the food,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.200]   we can talk to make sure we're satisfying whatever,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.960]   dietary needs or see what you think
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.360]   would be the best food to order.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.600]   That's a choke point or a checkpoint I mean.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   Everyone has to come together and gather
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.040]   before you can make progress going forward.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.760]   We all have to wait and gather at this checkpoint
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.360]   and then we can keep moving forward.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.540]   A feedback option gives people the option
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.880]   to provide you feedback, but even if they don't,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.680]   you can still move forward.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.160]   So here we might say, if you have any thoughts
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.240]   about the food or what food should be ordered,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.180]   I'm gonna order on Wednesday before the event
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.300]   in the afternoon, send me any like issues
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.760]   or dietary restrictions or whatever by that point,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.160]   or I have a document that we're planning the product in,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.600]   this is the space for it, put that all in there
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.800]   before the time I listed,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.040]   because that's what I'm actually gonna go in
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   and make the food order.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.800]   You can even set up a reminder about that
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.640]   to send automatically, the morning of,
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.720]   hey, by the way, remember,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.440]   if you have any thoughts on the food or feedback,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.840]   I'm ordering tonight.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.440]   Feedback options work great because people feel included.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.160]   If there's something important that they do want you to know
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.320]   they will then make sure they get you that information,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440]   but it allows you to actually move forward
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.960]   without being beholden to just going
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.880]   with back and forth emails, waiting for replies,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.680]   being stuck inside your inbox.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.520]   90% of the time, people don't actually have feedback
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.640]   on these things they wanna give you.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.120]   It's just the idea that they might, that upsets them.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.920]   I don't like that you ordered this food
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080]   without talking to us because what if
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.360]   we were inviting gremlins and it's after nine,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.640]   if they get water, they're gonna turn into monsters, right?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.520]   That's not what's happening, but it could have.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.920]   So, I'm upset you didn't talk to us ahead of time.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.600]   With a feedback option, you take that concern away.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.760]   Like, oh, I could have told you,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.600]   hey, by the way, no water, it's gremlins.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.820]   You told me how to say that.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.200]   You told me when you're ordering it.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.760]   You gave me a place to tell you that information.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.120]   So, I'm not upset about it.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.280]   So, you wanna have a process,
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   especially for logistical type gatherings like this.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.160]   And I should say, by the way,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.600]   I keep using this food example because
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.800]   in the elaboration of this question,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.760]   Rochelle gave a particular example about ordering food
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.840]   and her colleagues got mad at her for ordering it right away.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   So, that's why I'm using that example.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.640]   But use feedback options instead of feedback choke points.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.140]   Tell people ahead of time this is how I'm doing it.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.560]   People will be happy.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.380]   In the rare cases where you need feedback, you'll get it.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.560]   And now you can still execute without having to be stuck
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   waiting for random emails to come back,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   waiting for random email replies to make it back to you.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.360]   (upbeat music)
