[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   You know, we hear stress, stress is bad, stress can kill us, no one likes to feel stressed,
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.760]   etc.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.800]   But as you and I both know, that's not the entire picture.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.520]   So I'd love for you to just educate us a bit on what stress is and what it isn't, where
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.280]   it can be problematic and where perhaps it can even be beneficial.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:29.120]   So as a stress scientist, it is a word I use a lot, but it has to be broken down because
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.520]   it has so many different kind of dimensions and meanings.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.880]   So there's good and bad stress, there's acute and chronic stress, and you know, technically
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.000]   it just means anytime we feel overwhelmed, that we feel like the demands are too much
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.560]   for our resources.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.240]   So that's kind of a very technical way to put it.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.300]   But really, so much of life is about meeting challenges, and we're never going to get rid
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.400]   of different stressful situations in life, if anything, they are increasing.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.080]   And so it really comes down to not the stressors or what happens to us, but really how we respond,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.680]   the stress response.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.720]   So that's a distinction that we're still trying to get the field to talk about stress in a
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.480]   more specific way so that we can think about what situations are in your life.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.640]   They might be difficult ongoing situations like caregiving, or work stress, or worrying
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.880]   about health, your own or someone's.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.060]   And then there's how are you coping with it?
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.980]   So when something happens, we mount a stress response and we recover, and that's beautiful,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.120]   no harm done.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.120]   We need that.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.300]   That's why we're here still alive is that survival response.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.660]   It's a problem these days of just, we keep it alive in our head, we keep it alive with
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.660]   our thoughts.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.880]   Our thoughts are the most common form of stress.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.780]   Even though I expected that we would get into tools to combat stress a little bit later,
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.700]   since you have now told us that our thoughts are the biggest sort of propagator of internal
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.420]   stress, what to your knowledge is the best way or what are the best ways for us to manage
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.540]   overthinking and ruminating on stressful topics?
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.020]   Because I certainly experienced stress.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.740]   And when I do, I have tools related to breath work, running, exercise, sleep, non-sleep
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.740]   deep rest.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.700]   I'm a huge fan of all these sorts of things.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.940]   But when we succumb to stress and the thinking patterns take over where the gears are turning
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.460]   and they won't stop turning, what does the science tell us about ways to manage those
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.460]   thoughts?
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.340]   Should we go with them in the sense that we try and rationalize or understand the basis
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.100]   of the stress or should we try and divert our thinking away?
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.100]   Or is there some other tool that I'm unaware of?
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.900]   Yes, yes, both and.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.460]   So I like to bin it in three categories.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.340]   So one is we, well, I'll just say, first of all, we have to have some awareness of how
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.900]   our mind works or we're just like, you know, a subject to thinking our thoughts are real,
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.780]   thinking that it's helpful to keep ruminating and problem solving because that's our tendency
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.020]   is to go toward whatever we think there's threat or risk and to problem solve that.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.000]   We could just be stuck there all day in this kind of threat mode or red mind state.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.180]   And that's just a shame.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.100]   We don't need to turn on that stress response all the time.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.500]   But that's where we are as a society.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.060]   So that's why I wrote the stress prescription.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.260]   Take any survey, even pre-pandemic, and people feel, the majority of people feel an overwhelming
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.460]   amount of stress.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:00.060]   So even this past year, 46% of adults report feeling overwhelmed by stress.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.620]   And then you break it down, you're like, oh, this is really bad for young adults and women
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.620]   and people of color.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.420]   And so we have these, you know, groups that are targeted for marginalization that are
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.900]   feeling an extremely high amount of stress in most of those subgroups.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   So bottom, yeah.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.180]   Wouldn't you argue that most everyone is feeling more stress now or is it just, what do the
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.180]   data say?
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.180]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.660]   So I think that we're, we come with different levels of awareness of our stress.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.980]   And so when I find someone who really doesn't feel a lot of stress, sometimes I can see
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.740]   right through that and they're just not aware.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.500]   And sometimes it really is true.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.940]   They're often in a different stage of life and they control their environment a lot.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.180]   And they've been through a lot.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:59.740]   I mean, one of the big patterns in the population levels of stress is that the older people
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.980]   are less stressed, period.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.300]   If you're over 65, you have been through so much, solved so much.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.240]   You just have a better perspective on life and on stressors.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.740]   And then our adults, our young adults have like four times the level of stress as our
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.740]   older adults.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.700]   So we do, you know, we don't have to wait till we get older, but there certainly is
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.380]   true wisdom and resilience that comes with age for many people.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:31.060]   Often we're so used to feeling daily stress from our urban and modern life that we don't
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.060]   notice it.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.060]   We're just used to it.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.900]   And so we're going through the day with kind of like clenched hands and just, you know,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.900]   for listeners, just even just taking a check in now and noticing how you might be holding
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.300]   stress in your body.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.620]   That's a huge clue.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.700]   It's a huge place where we accumulate tension.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.380]   So we might not be aware that we're stressed, but we're clenching our hands.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:03.140]   And in fact, my taxi driver who drove me here, let me know that he's exactly that point,
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.980]   that he doesn't realize he's stressed until he realizes that he's tensing his shoulders
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.600]   and his fists.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.800]   And so great signal, you know, doing a check in to like notice where in our body we're
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:25.340]   holding stress is step one to releasing it.
