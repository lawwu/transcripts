[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   We are joined again by Matt Chandler, the lead pastor at The Village Church.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.600]   Matt is the author of the new book, The Mingling of Souls, God's Design for Love, Marriage,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.460]   Sex, and Redemption, and he joins us by phone in Dallas.
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.240]   Question number 10 in my list of questions for you, Matt, is this, "How does the gospel
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.880]   change or inform or help those who are dating who have been victims of past sexual abuse,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.960]   large numbers of men and women in the church represent this population?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.640]   How does Jesus Christ help the unique struggles that those Christians will face in the dating
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.160]   relationship and as they look forward to marriage?"
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.640]   Yeah, the first, I'm grateful to answer the question because I'm actually present in this
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640]   question.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   The home I grew up in was wrought with just about every type of abuse imaginable, and
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.960]   it does leave some marks and it does leave some dents and create some baggage that not
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.760]   just in dating but then on into the marriage are going to need to be gospeled.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:18.200]   And what gospel change and help occurs is that for the one that has not sat under the
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:27.600]   abuse but is free from that type of baggage, the gospel should create patience, compassion,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.800]   and empathy to walk alongside of the person who has bore the brunt of this abuse.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   Now, for the one that has bore the abuse, the gospel begins to reshape our identity,
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.920]   begins to reshape our hearts and wounds, enables us to begin to trust again, slowly
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.420]   but surely.
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.560]   And so when the gospel is at work, both in the one that was not abused and in the one
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.120]   that was, you have a person who is patient and empathetic and compassionate and a person
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   who is being reshaped and healed by the gospel in such a way that there's an opportunity
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.200]   to grow into intimacy that wouldn't have been possible outside of the gospel.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.280]   And so that's really how I know the gospel has worked in my own life and in my own marriage
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.480]   is Lorne was able to be very empathetic and compassionate and gracious and not demanding
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.160]   while the gospel did its work of healing and repairing the broken parts of me.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160]   Amen.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.600]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.280]   And for more on this, pick up Matt's book, The Mingling of Souls, God's Design for Love,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.800]   Marriage, Sex, and Redemption.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.440]   In chapter three, there's good instruction on how to talk about the abuse that you've
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.680]   experienced and to talk about it during courtship when things begin progressing towards marriage.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.500]   Well, we have time for one more question, a bonus question for tomorrow.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.640]   What gospel hope is there for singles who are lonely and for whom marriage seems so
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   unlikely?
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   I'll ask Matt in our final episode together.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.620]   We'll see you tomorrow.
