[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter and the sixteenth verse. The sixteenth
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.720]   verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:38.400]   And of his fulness have all we received, and grace upon grace.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.320]   We are looking at this great statement, this great summary which the Apostle here makes
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.200]   in the very prologue to his Gospel, of the blessings that have come to those who believe
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.780]   in him through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. That's the whole object of this
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.360]   Gospel as it is of all the other Gospels, to show the blessings which God has sent into
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.600]   the world in and through his only begotten dearly beloved Son. The Word was made flesh
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.200]   and dwelt among us. And why was that? Why did that happen? Why did he live as he lived?
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.400]   Why did he die as he died? Why did he arise again? Why did he pass through the heavens
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.120]   and take his seat at the right hand of God in the glory everlasting? And the answer is
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:43.240]   that we might receive of his fulness, and grace upon grace.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.760]   Now this is obviously a mighty subject, and that is why we are going through it as we
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.400]   are Sunday by Sunday. And the way we are approaching it is this. Obviously we can never receive
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   of his fulness unless we are clear as to who he is, and as to the fulness that is resident
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.280]   in him and always has been. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.040]   the Word was God. That is the fulness, and we have looked at it in other ways. And then
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.240]   we have had to consider how this fulness that was in the Son of God had first of all to
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.720]   be exercised on our behalf. There were certain things he had to do. There were certain obstacles
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.240]   that had to be removed. Our sinfulness, our guilt, and so on. And we have been considering
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:47.560]   that. How in this fullness of his, he has done certain things for us, objectively, entirely
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.160]   on our behalf. And now we are moving to consider how it is that having done all that, this
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.440]   fullness that is in him becomes available to us, how we can receive it.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.120]   And I suggested last Sunday morning as we began this consideration that the text as
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.000]   it were, the great statement in the Scriptures, in which again we have a summary of this particular
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.240]   aspect of the matter, is that 30th verse in the first chapter of Paul's first epistle
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.400]   to the Corinthians. "But of him," that's to say of God, "are ye," that's to say the
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:40.480]   Christians, "but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.400]   righteousness, sanctification, redemption." Now there it is again. God has made him in
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.040]   all his fullness to be unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption. And what we have
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.160]   to do therefore is to consider as best we can, with the aid of the blessed Spirit of
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.240]   God upon our minds and upon the Word, we have to try to understand what this means. And
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.520]   we have taken up therefore first of all the fullness of Jesus Christ as wisdom unto us.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:28.560]   God has made him in all his fullness to be unto us wisdom. He is to us wisdom from God.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.320]   Now I pointed out also how there is a corresponding statement which puts it from our side as it
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.880]   were, in the second chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians in the 16th verse,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   where the apostle makes the astounding statement, "We," Christians, "have the mind of Christ."
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.320]   You see what he's saying is this, "That the natural men receiveth not the things of
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.680]   the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he, because they are
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.440]   spiritually discerned. He that is spiritual," he goes on to say, "judgeth and understandeth
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.680]   all things; yet he himself is understood of no man. For who hath known the mind of the
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.440]   Lord, that he may instruct him?" And he answers with, I say, that most amazing statement,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:32.840]   "We have the mind of Christ." We have something of the understanding of the Son of God himself.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.000]   In other words, having received of his fullness, which includes this wisdom, we have something
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.760]   of his wisdom. We have the mind of Christ. Now this is the staggering claim which is
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.400]   made. This is the astounding thing that is possible to us as Christians. Of course, in
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.920]   saying all this, the apostle is but putting in his own words what our Lord himself had
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.080]   already said and had already claimed. You remember how he stood up one afternoon and
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:14.560]   made this assertion. He said, "I am the light of the world." In other words, he
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.280]   is the light, the only light, the only understanding that is in the world. "I am the light of
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:31.320]   the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.520]   of life." That's exactly the same thing. A man, he says, who believes in me and who
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.600]   follows me is no longer going to be groping about in the darkness. He is a man who is
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.360]   going to walk in the light of life, because he shall have, he shall be given the light
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.880]   of life. And there are many other statements. In other words, one aspect in which the gospel
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.640]   is always presented in the New Testament is this, that it has come into the world as light.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.200]   Matthew at the very beginning of his gospel quotes this Old Testament prophecy. "The
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:19.400]   people that sat in darkness have seen a great light." That's the whole meaning of this
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.280]   Advent season. That's the thing we must keep in our minds as we proceed during the
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.560]   coming weeks, to think of the coming of the Son of God into this world. Why did he come
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.840]   into the world? Well, he came in a sense in order to give light, to bring light. He's
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.000]   the light of the world. "And the people that sat in darkness have seen a great light."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.240]   Or again, as this apostle puts it in 2 Corinthians 4, 6, "God, who commanded the light to shine
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:54.720]   out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:04.840]   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Well now then, here is the first thing we've
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.280]   got to realize, therefore. Of his fullness of all we receive, what have we received?
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.880]   We've received light, we've received knowledge, we've received wisdom, we've received understanding.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:23.440]   Now, last Sunday morning we looked at that in a very general manner. I was concerned
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.200]   to show you how, with the whole world thinking of the murder, the assassination of the President
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.240]   of the United States, and bewildered and confused, I was concerned to show that the Christian
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:44.040]   Gospel gives us a new and a special attitude to things like that, to everything. The moment
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:51.320]   a man becomes a Christian, his whole outlook is renewed. He has a new orientation. Everything
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.800]   in life becomes different to him. We looked at it, I say, in a purely general manner,
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:05.280]   as a new attitude, a new point of view, a new perspective upon everything that happens
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.360]   in life. And I use the word "everything" deliberately. Nothing remains the same once
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.240]   a man becomes a Christian. He's at a new vantage point. He looks down upon life with
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:24.360]   this angle that comes from eternity. We have the mind of Christ. But now, we can't leave
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.120]   it as a mere general statement like that, but we must proceed to consider it in somewhat
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.000]   greater detail.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.760]   Now, perhaps the best way of approaching it is this. What, after all, has been the
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:50.720]   great quest of all civilization? Read the history of the world. Read your secular history
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.920]   books, and particularly concentrate upon the most intelligent aspect of the human story,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.040]   which isn't wars and battles and things like that, but the attempt of the human race
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:13.680]   to arrive at wisdom. That's been the greatest quest of the human race and of all civilizations.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.920]   There have been many civilizations. They've come, they've gone. But if you look at them,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:25.160]   you'll find that they were all ultimately concerned about this one thing. The great
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.400]   effort and endeavor of man has been to arrive at wisdom.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:39.240]   Now, another way of putting that is to say this, that the great endeavor of the human
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.040]   race has been to arrive at an adequate philosophy. And philosophy means nothing but a love of
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:54.640]   wisdom. A philosopher is a man who should love wisdom. That's what the term means.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:01.040]   And this, I say, is something that all the most serious, the most thoughtful, and the
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.320]   best men that the world has ever known have always been concerned about.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:12.240]   Well, now, then, what does it mean? What does philosophy seek after? What is this quest
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.200]   for wisdom? What is it that man really wants to know? And the answer, of course, is this.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:25.160]   He wants to understand himself. What is man? You see, before you begin to talk about what's
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.880]   wrong with the world, you should ask this question, "What is the world?" Before you
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.720]   begin to say what's wrong with men, that they behave as they do, you should ask the
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   prior question, "What is man?" Now, there is the first great question, "What is man?"
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:51.080]   Are you satisfied with the explanations that are given? Are they adequate? How can a man
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:12:00.560]   really understand himself? The study of mankind is man. And what a problem, what an enigma
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   man is. And the great minds of the ages have been concerned about this problem of trying
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.960]   to understand man. And then, obviously, from that there follows the whole problem of life
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:19.040]   in this world. What is it? What's its meaning? What's its purpose? Is there a meaning to
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:27.560]   it? Does it signify anything? Or is it merely full of sound and fury, signifying nothing?
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.680]   Now, the great minds have grappled with this. Is there sense in life? Is there meaning in
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:41.920]   life? Is there an end? Is there an objective? Or is man just like an animal, just like a
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:49.200]   flower? Comes, develops, flourishes, dies, no more? Now, these are the questions that
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.920]   have agitated the minds of all serious thinking people throughout the centuries. And then
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.720]   you go on and you add to that, how can one live in a world like this? How ought one to
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.120]   live? You see, this great question of morality comes up. It comes up of necessity. The moment
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:12.880]   men begin to live in society and in communities, difficulties arise. Selfishness and jealousy
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.040]   and so on. How can you accommodate these? How can men be taught how to live? How should
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.840]   one live? What should one do? Are there certain things that one shouldn't do? The whole
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.840]   question of morality and of ethics comes up at once. It's part and parcel of this whole
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:36.920]   problem of what is man and how should he live? And on you go with these questions. Here's
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:44.960]   another one. Is it possible to be happy in a world like this? And if it is, how can one
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   be happy? There's a problem with which the philosophers throughout the centuries have
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.560]   grappled. Happiness doesn't come naturally, doesn't come inevitably. It's a world of
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.320]   strain and of tension and of unhappiness, a world of disappointments. So the question
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.480]   has been raised, is it at all possible for one to be happy in this world? And if it is,
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:13.720]   how does one do it? And they've put up their theories and have considered them together.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:21.400]   And then of course, standing there in the background always and inevitably, the fact
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:30.680]   of death. What is death? Here's a question. Is it the end or is it but the gateway to
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:38.680]   something? What is death? Is there anything beyond it? Is there a realm the other side
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:47.240]   beyond? Now, I'm just giving you a summary of the themes about which wisdom, philosophy,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.800]   has always been concerned. And of course, a man who doesn't think about these things
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.640]   confesses himself to be a fool. He's hardly worthy of the name of man at all. If you don't
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.200]   stand aside and look on and ask questions and are concerned about all these things,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.720]   well, I say you're not living as a human being, you're living as an animal. If you
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.160]   just eat, drink, and be merry and indulge your passions and desires, that's not living,
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:17.040]   that's not man, that's animal. But man, thinking man, has always been grappling with
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   these problems. Now that's been the quest of wisdom. That's what the philosophers
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:27.800]   have always been after. They want answers to these great ultimate questions. Now, the
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.840]   whole position which the gospel takes up with respect to all this is this, that all that
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:44.560]   has failed, and has failed completely. Philosophy is a failure. Now, it isn't merely the gospel
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.960]   that says that. I think this can be demonstrated quite simply from a mere study of philosophy.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.400]   The contradictory theories, the way the predictions have not been verified and fulfilled, and
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.880]   so on, and the present complete impasse. There are some modern philosophers who even say
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:09.600]   that these questions should never be raised at all. They say all philosophy can do ultimately,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.600]   at its best and highest, is to define terminology. But you mustn't start talking about the
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.720]   spirit or life or death. That's something that's not scientific. It can't be touched
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.680]   and felt and handled. Philosophy mustn't even talk about love. It mustn't talk about
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:28.040]   happiness because these things are not material and therefore they can't be subjected to
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.320]   the usual tests which we apply in a scientific manner. Now, that's the attitude, as you
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.720]   know, which is again to confess that philosophy is bankrupt, that it is incapable, and that
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.480]   it's only playing when it deals with these ultimate questions, that it rarely knows no
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:51.520]   more than the most ignorant men in the universe. But now it's for us to discover why this
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.040]   failure of philosophy is from the beginning quite inevitable. And the answers seem to
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:08.460]   be these. There is in men, and the most powerful thing in men, is what we may call an irrational
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:14.240]   element. If only men were governed by his mind, the position would be very different,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:21.100]   but he isn't. In all of us there is an irrational element. There is something that bludgeons
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:27.520]   the mind. There is a vital force, there is a power, it is desire, and it's stronger
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   than a man's mind. So men, in spite of his theories, in spite of his knowledge, he behaves
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:44.680]   as a fool. Nobody can justify war. In an ultimate sense, war is madness. You don't settle
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.700]   questions and problems by killing one another. That's sure, irrationality, it's mad,
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.920]   but that's what man has always done. That's what he's still doing. Then I say this is
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.000]   one of the explanations of the failure. The irrational element in man, which is always
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.580]   stronger than his mind and his understanding. But then, in addition to that, and this is
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:12.080]   most important as you look at the long history of philosophy, and it comes out so clearly
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:19.680]   in the passages which we read at the beginning this morning, man has always had this feeling,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:29.240]   that over and above himself there are other powers and forces and factors. Unseen powers.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:36.200]   There is a realm which is unseen and spiritual, which man has always felt to be most powerful
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.000]   and potent in its influence upon him and his life and his career in this world. That is
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.720]   why, you see, in the ancient world you had polytheism. They worshipped various gods,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.400]   Mercury, Jupiter, and so on, and Mars, the god of war, the god of peace, the god of love,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.600]   the god of this, that and the other. They said, "Ah, there are other powers controlling
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.440]   man. He's here, but he's not the centre. There are forces working upon him more powerful
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.160]   than man himself." So you get animism even, gods in spirits and in trees, spirits in trees
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:20.520]   and in stones, and things of that kind. Man has always had this sense, this feeling, that
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:27.320]   there is something above and beyond himself which is more powerful than himself. And so
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:33.960]   this is the interesting thing that we find. That philosophy, the wisdom of this world,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:42.120]   man at his best and at his highest, never gets beyond this particular point. In this
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.680]   attempt to understand and to correlate these things he knows about himself, plus these
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.360]   forces and factors that are outside him and above him, the highest point that man has
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.400]   ever reached is this, that he has erected a temple and put up this inscription over
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:05.920]   it, "To the unknown god." Now then, that is where the story of Paul in Athens is so
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:16.240]   important. Athens, after all, was the capital of philosophy. It was the Mecca for all the
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.840]   wise men of the world. Never, perhaps, has the mind of man in its most flowering period
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.960]   reached a higher height than it did at the time just before our Lord came into this world
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.920]   when he had that succession of great philosophers in Greece and in Athens. But, you see, this
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.880]   is the point at which they'd arrived. With all their wisdom and their dissection and
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:45.280]   their analysis and their thoughts and theories, and all this awareness of the unseen powers
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.980]   and influence, they'd come to this conclusion that behind everything and beyond all the
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.560]   gods whom they knew, there was a god whom they couldn't get at, an unknown god. They
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.400]   realised he was there, they built their temple, they worshipped him, but they didn't know
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:06.640]   him, they couldn't find him. Now then, this is the most interesting and important point
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:16.440]   for us. The condition of the world before our Lord came into it, therefore, was this.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:23.980]   Not from the Jews, that one nation. The whole world was in a state of darkness, in a state
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:33.540]   of ignorance, in a state of evil and of sin. It was what is called paganism. And you see
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:39.360]   it, I say, at its very best there in Athens. They spent their time in doing nothing but
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:48.740]   either to tell or to hear some new thing. Intellectual curiosity, intellectual dilettantism.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:54.500]   You see, it's the bankruptcy of all thought. They were living on the latest idea, the latest
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.920]   suggestion, the latest theory, either to tell or to hear some new thing. They hadn't got
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.900]   anything stable, so they were ready to listen to any new idea. And it was full of the sort
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:12.580]   of thing you get in Great Britain today. Intellectualism, astrology with it, and then of course accompanying
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:19.540]   all this, a belief in the occult, and then in addition to that a kind of life which was
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.100]   characterized by immorality and by vice. There are descriptions of it in the New Testament,
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.540]   second half of the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans, and in other places you'll
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:36.140]   get it. Even these great philosophers were preachers of vice and of evil. Their temples
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:43.420]   were places of the most foul perversions. And some of the greatest of them were leaders
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.220]   in that kind of thing. Now there was your ancient world, apart from this one little
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:54.820]   nation, the Jews. That was the condition. It was darkness, it was ignorance, it was
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:00.620]   fumbling in the dark trying to find an answer, and the highest point it could reach was the
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:06.220]   unknown God. In other words, they felt this. If only we could get to know that God, then
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:13.580]   we'd have the answer. But they couldn't find it. As the apostle reminds the Corinthians,
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:21.500]   the world by wisdom, by philosophy, knew not God. So it could never get beyond that point
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:27.860]   of building him a temple and putting up that inscription to the unknown God.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:36.540]   But the important point for us to emphasize is this, that the world with its own wisdom
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:45.020]   had come to this conclusion, that this unknown God is the ultimate answer. He knows and he
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:51.820]   alone knows, and we shall only know when we get to know him. But that's the very thing
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.780]   of course that God had taught the children of Israel from the very beginning. You've
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:03.500]   got it stated perfectly in some of the Psalms. Listen to this. Here is the 10th verse of
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:11.740]   the 111th Psalm. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.540]   of all they that do his commandments. His praise endureth forever." First verse of
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:24.620]   Psalm 112. "Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.580]   greatly in his commandments." Now that was the essential message which God had given
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:35.100]   to the children of Israel. That's why they were a race apart. The fear of the Lord is
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.020]   the beginning of wisdom. You haven't got any until you come to that. Now that's the
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:45.020]   very point that human wisdom and philosophy had reached. If only we knew this unknown
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.860]   God, we'd have the wisdom. But they couldn't find him. They sought after him. If happy
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:56.220]   they might seek after him and find him, but they couldn't find him. He remained always
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:03.660]   an unknown God. You see it amounts to this. There is only one ultimate answer to this
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:13.100]   quest, this searching for wisdom, and it is the knowledge of God. But this is something
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:20.460]   that man can never achieve. That is where history is so important when you consider
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:26.940]   the message of the New Testament. Let us never forget this, that God had allowed that flowering
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:33.820]   period in Greek philosophy to come and to go before he sent his son into this world.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.460]   Man always believes that he can find God, that he can discover the ultimate answer.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.020]   God gave him an ample opportunity. Whatever you may believe about biblical chronology,
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:49.820]   we know this much it's inerrant. We know that there were 4,000 years at the minimum
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.420]   of civilization and of human history before the Son of God ever came into this world.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:00.860]   And during that time great empires arose, great civilizations arose. Man did his utmost.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:07.100]   He stood on tiptoe. He did everything to arrive at this ultimate source of wisdom. He completely
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:17.580]   failed. It was when the world by wisdom knew not God that it pleased God by the foolishness
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:27.100]   of preaching to save them that believe. Now this is a fundamental matter. You see, there's
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.300]   only one way whereby a man will ever know God and therefore will ever be wise, and that
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:38.940]   is to receive of his fullness whom God has made unto us to be wisdom and righteousness
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:45.380]   and sanctification and redemption. But why is it that men cannot attain to this knowledge
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:53.540]   of God? It's a very vital question, that. It's vital for this reason, that it is only
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:59.460]   when men and women come to a realization that they will never arrive at a knowledge of God
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   by their own unaided efforts that they'll be ready to listen to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.220]   The wise don't like this, hence the challenge of the Apostle Paul. Where is the wise? Where
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.980]   is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Let him come forward. What has he arrived
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:20.540]   at? And the answer is he gets never beyond this, the unknown God, exactly. We've had
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.540]   two thousand years since then to try to get further. Have we got further? The answer is
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:32.420]   no. The unknown God, whom ye ignorantly worship, says the Apostle to those Athenians, and they
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.700]   were Stoics and Epicureans. They were the best representatives of the philosophy of
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:44.060]   the age. Whom you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. Why can't men arrive
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:55.220]   at this knowledge of God? This is an important question even for those of us who are Christian.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.980]   Because it is only as we realize this that we will realize our utter dependence upon
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:09.780]   the Lord Jesus Christ, and see the vital necessity of receiving of his fullness, grace upon grace,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:15.380]   adding to grace constantly, we can do nothing without him. Why is this the case? Well, the
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:21.500]   answer of course is this, it is because of the nature and the character of the being
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.780]   of God. I say to you Christian people, as well as to myself, the main trouble with all
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:39.860]   of us is our utterly faulty conception of God. It comes out in the singing of our hymns.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.500]   I hear some of you trying to race ahead of the organ this morning. You didn't realize
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:29:00.180]   what you were singing, my friends. Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible,
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:13.380]   hid from our eyes. That's God. What do we know about God? It's not surprising that
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:20.260]   men by his seeking and by his wisdom cannot arrive at a knowledge of God. Listen to this
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:28.540]   18th verse of this first chapter of John's Gospel. "No man hath seen God at any time."
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:36.660]   We get it in the Old Testament. God says to Moses, "No man can look upon me and live."
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.940]   Moses had made his great request, "Show me thy glory." God said to Moses, "If you saw
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:50.300]   me as I am, it would kill you. You can't see me. I'll show you my back parts." So
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.940]   he put him in the cleft of the rock and put his hand as it were upon him and passed by,
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:02.900]   and Moses just had a glimpse of the glory of God disappearing. "No man hath seen God
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:11.220]   at any time. No man can see me and live." Why? Well, it's because God is characterized
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:18.780]   by an ineffable glory. We are given glimpses of this. The prophet Isaiah was given that
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.780]   vision, you remember? And the moment he had this glimpse of the glory of God, he said,
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.740]   "Woe is unto me, for I am undone. I'm a man of unclean lips." He was a very able man.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.780]   He was a great scholar, Isaiah. He was a very religious and a very devout man. But the moment
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.980]   he has this glimpse of the glory of God, he says, "I'm undone. I'm a man of unclean lips,
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:47.100]   and I dwell among a people with unclean lips. I'm unfit." The apostle Paul, at that glimpse
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.740]   of the Lord Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus, he's knocked down helpless, blinded. John
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:58.340]   fell down as one dead when he had a glimpse of this glory. My dear friends, we have no
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.780]   conception of this. We talk about God and we argue about God as if he were just a term
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.560]   in philosophy or somebody we can handle. God is over all. He's everywhere. He's from eternity
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:17.020]   to eternity, infinite in his holiness, infinite in all his attributes. We have no conception
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:26.820]   of glory. We have no conception of holiness. God is light, and in him is no darkness at
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:34.660]   all. Oh, my dear friends, let us dwell more upon the being, upon the attributes, upon
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:41.660]   the glory of the everlasting and eternal God. And the moment you do so, you begin to realize
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:47.580]   that all your efforts are useless. Oh, how can I, whose native sphere is dark, whose
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:58.140]   mind is dim, before the ineffable appear and on my naked spirit bear that uncreated being?
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.580]   That's the question. But you see, there it is from that side. That's enough in itself,
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:10.020]   but let's look at it from our side. Look at man, and what a fool man is, ever to imagine
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.420]   that he could ever arrive at this knowledge of God and of wisdom. Look at man, look at
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:20.940]   his finite character, look how small he is, look at his brain, how petty the thing men
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:27.940]   so proud of today. But what do we know? What do we really know? I'm not disparaging discoveries,
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.700]   of course, that would be folly. I rejoice in them, I thank God for them, but as I say,
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:37.740]   the question still we ask is this, what do we know in contrast with what we don't know?
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:43.300]   What do we know about ourselves? Leave alone this everlasting and eternal and glorious
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:49.420]   being. But you see, over and above our finite character, and that's enough, we are too
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:55.700]   small. Our brains are inadequate to encompass the infinite and the absolute. But in addition
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:03.820]   to that, we lack what is perhaps most essential of all, and that is spirituality.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:09.820]   Now the Apostle Paul poses a very great and important question in the second chapter of
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.540]   that first epistle to the Corinthians. In the eleventh verse, I think it is, where he
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:24.100]   says, "A man knoweth a man by the spirit of men that is in him." Now that's a great
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:32.260]   question. What men, he says, what men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of men
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:40.580]   which is in him? Then even so, the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.460]   In other words, it comes to this, that before you can know, you've got to have a certain
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:50.020]   spirit in you. If you want to know science, have the scientific spirit. If you want to
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.700]   understand music, well, you must be musical. It doesn't matter how clever you are. If
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:00.140]   you are not musical, well, the most glorious musical would be nothing but a horrible cacophony
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:06.460]   for you. You need the corresponding spirit. And when you come to the realm of persons,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.940]   it is infinitely more important. If you really want to know a person, there must be some
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:17.620]   sympathy, there must be some correspondence, there must be some relationship of spirit
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:22.340]   so that there can be a give and a take. It's absolutely essential. So the apostle says
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:28.900]   that no man, therefore, can know the things of the spirit of God. Why? Well, because he
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:37.340]   lacks the spiritual capacity. Man, by nature, is not spiritual. He is a materialist and
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:43.620]   his outlook is material. We have a fundamental lack of an essential spirituality. But on
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:52.020]   top of all that, man is sinful. And this is what finally makes the thing an utter and
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:57.180]   a complete impossibility. Let me read you the words of the apostle, in which he puts
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:06.660]   it once and forever, in 2 Corinthians 6, verse 14 and following. "What communion hath light
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:14.980]   with darkness? What conquered hath Christ with Baelian, or what part hath he that believeth
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:20.260]   with an infidel? What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" But here is the fundamental
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:30.340]   question. What communion hath light with darkness? Or how is it possible for darkness ever to
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:36.220]   have communion with light? And every one of us is darkness. Every one of us is sinful,
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:41.500]   every one of us is born with a perverted mind. We have a natural hatred of God and we delight
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:49.460]   in evil by instinct. That's because there's darkness in us. And God is light and in him
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:58.300]   is no darkness at all. So it is clearly, utterly, and completely impossible for man, as he is,
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.900]   ever to arrive at this knowledge of God. And if he doesn't arrive at the knowledge of
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.460]   God, he'll never have wisdom, he'll never have understanding. The philosophers have
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.700]   come to that. God is the key to it all. How can we arrive at God? If only then we'd
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:16.100]   have knowledge and understanding. But we can't find him. He remains the unknown God. He eternally
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:24.060]   eludes us. Now, the Apostle Paul goes even as far as to
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:34.420]   say this, that man is inexcusable all the same. He says that man, with his reason and
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:42.700]   his observation, should have arrived at a knowledge of God the Creator. Because, he
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:49.020]   says, God has left his marks, his imprint, he's left suggestions for us. Listen to
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:55.500]   him. In Romans 1, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.380]   has showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:06.620]   are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:14.260]   and Godhead, so that they are without excuse." What he means is this, you see, that if men
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:22.100]   only reason clearly and haven't got this horrible bias produced by sin, a flower should
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:29.420]   be enough to make him believe in God, the order, the arrangement, the design, the perfection,
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:37.020]   and all nature and creation, it all proclaims a master mind, a creator, a power above everything,
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.700]   controlling and ordering all things. If only men reasoned as he should, he'd arrive at
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:47.980]   that, but he can't, he's blinded by sin. But this is the point. Even if our reason
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:53.220]   were capable of bringing us to this knowledge of God's eternal power and Godhead, his
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:38:02.580]   creatorship as it were, it still wouldn't give us the wisdom we stand in need of. It
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:08.380]   would be a very partial knowledge of God. We would know something of his power, something
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.580]   of his great mind in designing and creating the universe and upholding it, but it would
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.900]   never take us beyond that. But what we need is something beyond that. We want to know
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:23.820]   God as he is, so that we can go to him and receive from him. Now then, here is the fundamental
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:35.300]   proposition of the whole of the Christian gospel. This knowledge of God is alone possible
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:43.340]   in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Now that is the first fundamental statement
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:49.860]   of the Christian faith. It's the challenge. We are here to challenge the whole world.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:55.060]   There is no wisdom apart from Christ, because there's no knowledge of God apart from him,
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.260]   and doesn't the world prove it? Why is the world as it is, in this sophisticated age,
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:04.300]   with all our advantages and all our development? Why is the world the hell that it is today?
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:12.900]   What's the matter? It's the failure of man and his wisdom and his philosophy. And
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:19.980]   there is only one way whereby man can ever become wise, and that is that he begins to
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:26.540]   receive of his fullness, and grace upon grace. Now all I want to do before I close this morning
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:32.940]   is to just give you some of the great statements of that in this gospel of John alone. It's
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:38.020]   the great theme of this gospel. Here it is in verse 18 again. "No man hath seen God
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:49.580]   at any time. The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:55.700]   him." He's led him forth. He's brought him out. He's given us a revelation of him.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.340]   Now that is the great fundamental postulate of the whole of the Christian faith. Man hasn't,
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:07.380]   cannot. "The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:13.420]   him, made him known." And he alone can do it. Listen to our Lord saying this to Nicodemus.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:20.100]   "Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel? and knowest not these
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:25.780]   things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that which
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:32.300]   we have seen. And ye receive not our witness, if I have told you earthly things, and ye
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:38.740]   believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:46.220]   up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in him. No man
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.780]   hath ascended into heaven, no man ever will ascend into heaven, and God is in heaven,
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.100]   and man is upon the earth. And how can ye know God unless ye can ascend into the heavens?
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:01.020]   And ye can't. It needs someone to come down. He's come. Here's the message of Adrian.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:09.580]   Let me go on to the fourth chapter of John's Gospel, and the twenty-second verse. Our Lord
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.660]   is speaking to the woman of Samaria, and he puts it like this to her, "Ye worship ye
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:25.500]   know not what? We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jew. Ye worship ye know
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.740]   not what? As Paul said to the Ephesians, whom ye ignorantly worship, your feeling, your
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:38.380]   groping, you don't know him. We know." That's why he's come. Listen to it in the fifth chapter
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:47.260]   of John's Gospel, in verse thirty-seven. "And the Father himself which hath sent me hath
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:42:01.020]   borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:07.460]   You know nothing, says our Lord. You haven't heard the voice of God, you haven't seen the
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.900]   shape of God. I have. I have come from him. This is the whole of his argument. I have
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:19.540]   already read to you John 8, 12. "I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:26.660]   not walk in darkness, but have the light of life." Go on to John 14, 6. "I am the way,
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:32.580]   the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me." Even if you arrive
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:38.100]   at a belief in his power and godhood and creatorship, you'll never know him as Father. "No man
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:44.620]   cometh unto the Father but by me." And again in John 14, 9. Our Lord is telling them that
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:51.940]   he's about to go. Philip says, "Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:56.420]   Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:07.100]   me, Philip?" He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. He's the expression of the Father.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:13.420]   He and he alone is the expression of the Father. And then finally in the 17th chapter, listen
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:21.060]   to these words. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God and
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:28.460]   Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." John 17, 3. There it is. And take John 17, 25.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:36.040]   "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:45.700]   have known that thou hast sent me." There it is. "The world hath not known thee, and
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:52.740]   the world doesn't know him now. And all its efforts after wisdom and understanding
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:58.940]   and knowledge and producing a world fit to live in and a happiness, it's all a failure.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:15.260]   Why, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these Christians have
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:20.180]   known that thou hast sent me." In other words, they believe in me. "I've got the
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:27.460]   knowledge which spells wisdom, and these who believe in me will receive of my fullness
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:38.800]   and grace upon grace, and so they shall have wisdom. Who of God is made unto us wisdom
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:45.220]   and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. That as it is written, 'He that
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:53.100]   glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.'" My dear friend, have you received of his
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:45:04.740]   fullness? Do you know God? Do you know God as your Father? "No man cometh unto the
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:14.620]   Father, but by me." Do you know God to be your Father? Do you go to him as a child?
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:23.940]   Do you pray with confidence? It is only the man who has received of his fullness that
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:39.060]   knows God as his own personal Father. Receive of him, my friends. It is all in him, and
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.860]   there is nothing apart from him. Amen.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:49.980]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All
