[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   A podcast listener named Lawson writes in with a great question. I love this. "Pastor John,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.480]   this fall I entered high school as a freshman. I want to know how can I be a Christlike example
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.600]   in my school and among my classmates? I feel that God has called me to minister to them in some way,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.520]   but I don't know exactly how to do this. Over the next four years, what are some practical
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.920]   steps I can take to redeem these years for the gospel?" Lawson, as I look back over my high
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.520]   school days, it was a long time ago, I'm 70, and as I ponder what I see in the Bible and think
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.960]   about God's calling on your life expressed in your words, which I'm so thankful for,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:49.120]   six or seven things come flooding to my mind to suggest for you to pray about and consider first.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.960]   Gather a few friends with a similar desire, maybe from your church, neighborhood,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.040]   wherever you've got your Christian friends. I hope it's your church. And set aside with them
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.520]   some regular time, maybe 30 minutes a week, that's what I do with my friends,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.120]   or 10 or 15 minutes a day at the beginning of school, where you read a short passage of
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.680]   Scripture, like maybe take one minute to read a passage of Scripture, and then pray for 10 minutes
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.400]   or 15 minutes or 30 minutes, whatever you've planned, that God would help you, fill you with
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.560]   Holy Spirit, fill you with boldness, give you guidance, and then go on into your day together
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.080]   as a band of brothers. And maybe you will call that group the 429 group. And the reason I say
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.840]   that is because of Acts 429. And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.480]   continue to speak your word with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.000]   and wonders are performed in the name of your holy servant, Jesus. And when they had prayed,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.840]   the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.520]   and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. Oh, I wish I had done that as a
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.240]   teenager, had myself a small group, a band of brothers, prayed down to God's power,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.520]   and been more bold. Number two, brainstorm together with your group of friends about proactive,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   visible good deeds that you could do for others at school or in the neighborhoods. And I say this
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.880]   because of 1 Peter 2.12, "Keep your conduct among the Gentiles, honorable," Gentiles means
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.600]   unbelievers, "honorable, so that when they speak against you as evil doers, they may see your good
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.880]   deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation." Good deeds, Lawson, of course, can never replace
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.600]   words that explain the gospel and why you love Christ. In fact, just three verses earlier,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   verse nine of 1 Peter 2, he said, "Proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.360]   darkness into his marvelous light." But practical good deeds have an important role to play,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.600]   and they can put to silence the criticism that Christianity just means not doing certain things.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   My dad used to love to quote one of his teachers, he'd say to me, "Do so fast you don't have time
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.600]   to don't." Because we were pretty serious Christians growing up, and there are a lot of
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   things we didn't do because we were Christians. And he said, "No, be so fast in doing you don't
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.040]   have time to don't." That's what I'm suggesting in number two. Number three, be on the lookout for
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:00.560]   lowly people, lonely people, hurting people, and step into their lives with interest and care and
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.040]   time that other people don't care about giving. Romans 12, 16, "Live in harmony with one another.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:16.480]   Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight." What an unusual
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:26.720]   teenager you will be if you do that. Number four, meet with the Lord alone early every morning,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:36.400]   and get a good word from Scripture that you will keep in your mind as something precious
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.560]   and valuable and encouraging all day long. In other words, don't just have devotions
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:51.200]   and come away with nothing stuck in your mind, but look for some single phrase or statement or
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.080]   promise or command that helps you and keep it in your mind. You might jot it on a little piece of
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.120]   paper and stick it in your shirt pocket. That's what I used to do. This will serve you all day
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.200]   long for encouragement, and it'll be there if somebody gets into a conversation with you and
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.000]   asks you, "What does it mean for you to be a Christian?" You can smile and say, "You know,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.840]   just this morning, I was talking to God, and He was talking to me." Now, He doesn't talk with a
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.360]   voice. He talks in the Bible. "He was talking to me, and this is what He said." Then you quote your
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.120]   verse or you get out your little piece of paper, and you read them and say, "That's encouraging me
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.840]   all day long. That's what it means for me to walk with God." Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.680]   alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." So take a word, take a phrase,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.360]   and go with it all day long for encouragement and readiness. Fifth, plan activities with your
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:00.400]   friends that you can invite unbelievers to be a part of. In other words, don't wait for the crisis
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.440]   where they invite you to go to something that you're not sure you can go to. Then you have to
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.120]   say no, and you might simply look like somebody who doesn't like people or doesn't have any
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:21.040]   friends. Beat them to the happy punch. Show them that you love to have them join you by doing
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.720]   proactive thinking ahead of time that plans something that you and your friends can do,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.640]   and then you're asking them constantly to join you rather than the other way around. Six,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.240]   if you have parents, and I don't know your family situation, but if you have parents who love what
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.920]   you're doing, try to make your home a hub of relationships with your friends, unbelievers
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.560]   and believers. So many young people out there that you relate to don't have any homes like that.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.000]   They wouldn't ever bring you over to their homes. Their parents are divorced or they're not there,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.640]   or they're always angry at each other, or nobody's ever home, or they're watching television,
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   or they never pay any attention, or they never do any proactive hospitality. They've never seen a
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:22.800]   beautiful family. And if you have one, show it off by making your home a hub of activity. Show
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:31.280]   young people that it's not uncool to hang out with or near adults. And the last thing I would say,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.080]   like it says in 1 Peter 3 15, "In your heart, honor Christ the Lord as holy,
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:45.440]   and always be ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.680]   in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect." Now, that doesn't mean you need an advanced
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.720]   college degree in apologetics to defend your faith and have answers to every hard question
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.680]   that someone might ask. It doesn't mean that. He's not saying that. What he's saying is that
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:13.520]   you should be ready simply to tell someone why you have hope in Jesus. And the answers are in
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.760]   chapter one of 1 Peter. He died for you. God is merciful toward you. He raised Jesus from the
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.400]   dead. He promises the forgiveness of sins. In other words, you recite the gospel as the foundation
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.960]   of your hope. Peter's not telling us to prove anything. He's telling you to explain to them
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.800]   why you have hope, why you believe. So, Lawson, praise God for what he's put in your heart for
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:47.040]   this year. And I pray that this will be the best year yet for you, and that God will fill you with
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.600]   wisdom and grace like he did Stephen in Acts chapter seven, whose words were so mighty,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   so gracious, so full of the spirit that his adversaries could not resist him.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.440]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. I will be praying for you, Lawson, as well, that you would find
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.880]   some friends at school, a band of brothers, and even send them this episode if you feel so inclined.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.360]   And let's all pray for our kids and for our friends that we know who are in school,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   that God would give them strategic relationships and opportunities for celebrating Christ.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.160]   Well, for more details about this podcast or to catch up on past episodes we have released,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.320]   or to subscribe to the audio feed, even to send us a question of your own like Lawson did today,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. Well, Pastor John and I will
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.440]   close out the week with a question about how John Piper tests his own interpretations of the Bible.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.720]   How does he discern whether or not his conclusions are true and biblical? It's a good question. I'm
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.960]   your host Tony Rehnke. We'll see you on Friday to find out.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:49.840]   [END]
