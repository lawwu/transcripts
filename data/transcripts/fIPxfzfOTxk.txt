[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   The following is a conversation with George St. Pierre,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.620]   considered by many to be the greatest fighter
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.240]   in the history of UFC and MMA,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.600]   but even more than that,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.360]   one of the greatest martial artists ever.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.160]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.720]   Allform, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, Theragun,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.680]   and The Information.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.980]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.240]   As a side note, let me say that getting the chance
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.240]   to hang out with George, talk to him on the podcast,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   record a quick self-defense video that I'll release soon,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.320]   all while both of us wearing suits
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.440]   was one of the most memorable days of my life.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.680]   In setting all this up, I talked to Joe Rogan,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.720]   and originally we couldn't schedule a chat
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.320]   with him and George on the JRE,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.520]   which allowed me to pretend for a brief time
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.860]   that George came down to Austin just to see me.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.000]   Who the hell am I?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.080]   In truth, him and Joe probably conspired
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.740]   to make me feel special, but that's the point.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.520]   It's inspiring to see George and Joe,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   who are at the top of their field,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.320]   treat others as equals, as human beings,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.640]   no matter who they are, even silly Russians in a suit.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.760]   Meeting George was an honor for me beyond words.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.320]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.040]   and here's my conversation
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.840]   with my longtime martial arts hero,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440]   and now my friend, Mr. George St-Pierre.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.720]   In your fighting career,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.600]   were you more motivated by the love of winning
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.820]   or the fear and hatred of losing?
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.720]   - I like to win better than I hate to lose,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   because if it would not have been the case,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760]   I would never have fought in the first place
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.360]   because I don't like to fight at all.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   - But you talked about the anxiety,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.240]   the fear that you experienced leading up to a fight.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.280]   So to you, ultimately, the reason to go through
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.000]   that difficult process is because it feels damn good
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.260]   to have your hand raised?
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.920]   - There is that.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.080]   There is also the fact that martial art
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.840]   had been introduced when I was very young,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   and it's probably the best thing I can do in my life.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.680]   Fighting, that's what I do best.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.960]   Also, it provides me of freedom,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   of access of things that most of people do not have,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.040]   but all that as a price, and a lot of money.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.140]   I made a lot of money, of course, with it.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.280]   I was maybe predisposed with certain abilities.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.300]   I met incredible mentors throughout my life.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.480]   I worked really hard,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.040]   and of course, I had a lot of chances.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800]   The stars were all aligned.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.840]   And in order to keep those advantages of freedom,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.640]   money, and glory, and access of things
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.600]   that most people don't have,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.860]   and have this dream life that I have,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.440]   I had to sacrifice myself and fight in order to keep it.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.520]   It's very hard to understand
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.280]   because I also believe most fighters are not like me.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.560]   A lot of guys, because I corner a lot of guys,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.960]   and it seems to me that they love their job.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   They enjoyed to go fight in the cage.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.040]   I love to train.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.840]   I love the science of fighting, the sport,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.000]   to be in good shape,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.480]   the confidence that training in mixed martial art give me.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.520]   However, I do not like the feeling of uncertainty,
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.480]   the stress that I have,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.840]   not knowing if I will be badly injured,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   or humiliated, or winning the fight.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.760]   It's, to me, unbearable.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.320]   And that's what takes the most out of me.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.480]   More than brain damage, more than anything,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.920]   that's what takes the most out of me.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.520]   - But the thing you get from it is the freedom
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.600]   that you get because of the money,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.920]   but because of the celebrity,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.760]   because of everything that comes with it.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   So you can be the best version of yourself
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.640]   because of fighting.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.600]   But at the same time, you've said that,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.200]   quote, "I don't believe there's pleasure in life.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.920]   "I believe there's only a relief from pain.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.240]   "We have to suffer to be on top."
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.560]   So isn't there something to just the suffering in itself,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.800]   just doing really difficult shit just to get to the top?
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.600]   - To explain that, and so people can relate to it,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.320]   'cause not everybody's a fighter,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   I think the best example I can give is,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.560]   let's say you haven't eat for a long time
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.040]   and you're craving, right?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.280]   So you're suffering.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.880]   And then when it's time to eat,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.920]   finally, you're about to eat your favorite dish.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.680]   It's gonna taste so much better.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.720]   So that's why I believe there's always
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.480]   some sort of sacrifice before the pleasure.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.760]   And the more sacrifice you do,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.320]   like they say in fighting,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.360]   the bigger the risk, bigger is the reward.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.160]   And I feel that's how it is for me.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.560]   - Yeah, I feel that with,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.240]   I've started fasting a little bit
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.880]   in the past couple of years.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.040]   And there's nothing as amazing as a delicious meal
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.600]   or anything, actually anything,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.480]   any food when you haven't eaten for several days.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.440]   It's kind of incredible.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.080]   And it's not incredible in the simple way
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.760]   of finally I get to eat.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.960]   You get to truly experience the beauty
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.720]   of what it is to be alive.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.480]   Like that little piece of food,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.760]   you see all the flavors,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.960]   you feel just the experience of it
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.840]   is ultimately of gratitude
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.160]   of how awesome it is to be alive.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.880]   But when you eat many times a day
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.640]   and you're pigging out,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.920]   you don't get to experience that.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.040]   And it's fascinating.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.320]   It's really like fasting
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.480]   is one of the most accessible things for people,
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.320]   I think to experience that kind of
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.440]   pairing of hardship to pleasure.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.280]   - I agree.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.320]   And in my case, it changed my life on a good way.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.960]   I cannot recommend it to people
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.040]   because everybody is different.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.360]   But after my, to fight Michael Bisping,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.080]   my last fight was against the champion
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.320]   in the heavier weight class that I used to compete at.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.080]   So I thought that if I would gain weight,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.920]   it would increase my performance.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.440]   And I struggled a lot to gain weight.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   I gained a little about eight to 10 pounds.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.360]   Normally I walk around 185 pounds.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.840]   And for that fight, I was walking around 195.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.120]   However, I forced myself to eat like six times a day.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.960]   I was on a very strict diet.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.520]   And it didn't feel right to me
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.640]   because I feel like I was carrying,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.200]   like a little bit like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   And I think it was a bad idea for me
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.640]   because when I did the weigh-in
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.840]   and I went on a scale at 185,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.200]   I couldn't go back to my initial weight that was 195,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.680]   that I worked so hard for several months to get there.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.000]   So I was 190 pound, but I couldn't get back.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.320]   And the morning of the fight, I got sick.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.520]   I had like, we didn't know what it was in the beginning
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.840]   because in order to know, to find out what it was,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.880]   I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.280]   They put a camera inside of you.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   And to do that, they give you something that make,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.800]   that empty you.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.920]   And I was trying to gain weight, not to lose weight.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.440]   So I told myself, I'm gonna wait after the fight,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.880]   whatever it is, because it was pretty bad.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.720]   It was blood.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.120]   And I didn't know what I was.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.840]   I was very concerned.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.040]   I thought I had maybe cancer.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.120]   I was freaking out.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.680]   So I said, I'm gonna do that fight.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.120]   And then after right away, I'm gonna make a checkup.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.200]   So I did the fight.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.240]   Everything went well.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.080]   I won the fight.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.920]   I went back home.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.720]   I did a colonoscopy and I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.680]   Then I got on very severe medication to get better.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.040]   And I'm not a big fan of medication.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   I always trying to look for more natural way to get better.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.640]   And I found out about fasting and it really changed my life.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.360]   I met Dr. Jason Fong, who's one of the,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.160]   one of the world authority of fasting.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.520]   He treat diabetes patient with fasting.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.320]   And he gave me a program of fasting
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.240]   and it really changed my life.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   And right away, what I did is I went in a CAT scan
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.560]   to see the difference,
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.240]   because it was right after my fight with Michael Bisping.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.160]   And I did the CAT scan.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.120]   So I had my muscle mass, bone density,
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.960]   fat percentage, water retention.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.920]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.520]   It can show you which harm has more muscle than the other.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.000]   It's very precise.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.440]   And I did it like two months after.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   So I started doing time restricted eating, 16/8,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.640]   but right away when I started, I did three days water fast.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.600]   And the Dr. Jason Fong says,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.680]   because I like to train during those days,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.320]   I consume Himalayan salt to make sure,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.640]   because when you sweat, there's a lot of minerals
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.000]   to make sure you don't depleted your mineral.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.280]   And when I compared the two result in the CAT scan,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.240]   I found out my biggest concern was to lose muscle mass.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.760]   I found out that I did not lose muscle mass.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.880]   Instead of losing it, it increased a little bit.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.280]   Even though my weight on the scale was lighter,
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.240]   I kept the same muscle mass, even increases a little bit.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.800]   My bone density increases a little bit.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.160]   My water retention is the biggest thing that decrease.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.600]   So my inflammation and my fat percentage.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.560]   So basically by looking at the data,
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.840]   I found out that by eating so much,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.800]   trying to gain weight to fight my cold,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.280]   I only increases my water retention, which is not good
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.800]   because it's like dead weight and inflammation on you.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.280]   - So what was the actual process of fasting?
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.720]   You said 16, eight time restricted,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.520]   so intermittent fasting,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.680]   but you also mentioned the three day water fast.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.200]   What did that feel like?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.000]   And you also said training during the three day.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.440]   - Yes. - How did that feel?
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.720]   Can you give me some details of-
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.280]   - Absolutely. - This is fascinating.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   - So I do three days water fast, four time a year.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.720]   - Nice. - For me, I do it,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.560]   everybody is different,
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.480]   but for me, I do it after New Year's
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.960]   because during the holidays,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.320]   that's when I eat bad foods and I drink.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.600]   I see it more like a cleansing,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.080]   like a detox, so to speak.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.480]   - Mental too, like psychological.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.320]   - Yes.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.680]   I do it after the New Year's, right before the summer,
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.120]   cut for the beach if I have to.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.920]   After the summer, because in the summer,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.400]   I've been partying a little bit sometime,
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.520]   let myself go and right before the holidays.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.320]   And I've tried, the doctor, Fong, he says to me,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.520]   he said, "George, everybody's different
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.280]   because I'm a very active person
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.840]   and everybody has a different genetic."
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   So for me, I feel that three days is the sweet spot
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.720]   because I still train during those three days.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.640]   The first day, the first two days, I don't change nothing.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.680]   I train on my regular schedule.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.280]   However, on the third day, I modify a little bit.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   I do something more easy and that's how I do it.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.600]   And I've tried before because when I say three days
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.560]   is my sweet spot, I've tried to go up to five days.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.880]   But the problem is after my third days,
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.000]   I found out that I had a big problem sleeping.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.800]   I get into a hyperactive mode.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.960]   They call that the hunter-gatherer mode.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.600]   Your brain, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.320]   Your creativity is at its peak,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.080]   but you cannot sleep very well.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.160]   And sleeping, for me, I think it's very important.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.640]   So that's why I do three days.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.240]   For me, it's my sweet spot.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   - That's interesting.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.900]   You're right.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.840]   It's the four or five days when you start.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.720]   See, sleep is not important for me.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.440]   So the creativity is really important.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.320]   So it's very interesting the places your mind goes
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.560]   after a few days.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.400]   You're right.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.760]   But I mean, what does it do to your mind?
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.800]   So you mentioned your body likes it.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.960]   In terms of training,
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.840]   do you find that it helps you focus and think?
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.480]   I mean, you're one of the great strategic thinkers
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   in terms of martial arts.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.000]   Does it help with learning?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.120]   Does it help with thinking?
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.540]   Does it help with strategizing and all that?
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   - Well, unfortunately, I got into fasting after I retired.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.840]   I wish I would have, I really wish people ask me,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.720]   "Would you have done it during the time that you competed?"
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.200]   And the answer is yes.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.920]   I think we live in a society
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.840]   that we're bombarded by publicity.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   Oh, buy this, eat protein, this, that.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.320]   And fasting, nobody makes money with it
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   because there's nothing to sell.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.200]   I think that's why a lot of people have not heard about it.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.400]   And even for myself,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.760]   if someone would have talked to me
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.520]   about the benefits of fasting when I was training,
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.360]   before I got sick,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.320]   I would probably have ignored him
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.960]   because it's hard to believe.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.800]   - Sounds ridiculous.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.280]   Don't eat. - It sounds, yes.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.400]   - It's gonna help your mind
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.600]   and you're going to gain muscle potentially.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.440]   - Exactly.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.040]   And perhaps people have talked to me about it,
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.640]   but it went in one of my hair
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.560]   and got out from the other side.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.920]   But it really changed my life.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.800]   I was diagnosed with ulcer colitis
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.640]   and it helps me get rid of all my symptoms.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.440]   What I do is, I know a lot of people have ulcer colitis.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.040]   And for me, I cannot recommend it to other people
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.440]   because everybody is different.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.280]   But for me, I made a lot of research
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.680]   of how people from ulcer colitis got better.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.800]   And I found out that a lot of people that got that condition
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.920]   get better in a natural way through fasting,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.680]   eating fermented food, collagen,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.840]   and bone broth and stuff for their gut.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.120]   And it made a huge difference in my life.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.440]   I just wish I would have known that before.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.920]   - So do you have a specific diet wise stuff you like?
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.840]   So I've recently, another ridiculous sounding thing,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.520]   but it makes me feel really good, is very low carbs.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.640]   So keto, even carnivore, it sounds ridiculous.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.320]   It doesn't make any sense,
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.440]   but it makes me feel really good even for performance.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.360]   - Is Rogan has influenced you?
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.880]   He's a carnivore diet.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.640]   - I was influenced actually by people.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.920]   Yeah, well, he, there's, I'll tell you where,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.360]   'cause I was doing it before he was doing it,
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.480]   is there's, it was popular
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.080]   in the endurance athlete community
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.120]   where it was fat adapted athletes.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.200]   It was people who, insane people who run 50 miles,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.480]   a hundred miles, they figured out
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.160]   that they could fuel their body by, with fat.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.880]   They can go to fat as the source of energy
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.040]   as opposed to carbs.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   So I remember hoping that I'll be able to learn
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.560]   how to run 50 miles and so on.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.400]   I've never done more than 22,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   but I just remember switching away from carbs
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.200]   and feeling really liberated.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.080]   Like I wasn't thinking about food as much.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.000]   I'm able to eat once a day and feel really good.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.840]   I mean, I think everybody's body's different,
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.480]   but I think carbs make me lazy.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.520]   Maybe it's because- - The crash.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.880]   - Yeah, it's the crash,
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.400]   but also just psychologically something,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.480]   it forces me to also think about food too much.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.200]   Like it starts becoming, you know,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.440]   just like you said, our society is so much about food.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.200]   There's so many, so much advertisement
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.520]   and so much of our social life is about food.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.160]   And so it's very easy to live life,
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.720]   like live day to day thinking, when is the next meal?
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.880]   Like, what am I gonna eat for lunch?
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.800]   What am I gonna eat for dinner?
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.840]   What am I gonna eat for breakfast?
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.240]   And if you're not careful,
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.560]   that's gonna get in the way of you doing cool shit
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.840]   for like liberating yourself and thinking like,
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.000]   what am I actually passionate about in this life?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.080]   Like creating and forgetting to eat,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.120]   those kinds of things,
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.760]   and still being able to fuel your body.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.600]   I don't know.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.080]   It's been fascinating to figure out like later in life
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.280]   that carbs aren't necessary to function well.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.040]   It makes me think like we don't know anything
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   about nutrition.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.200]   - That's right.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.040]   Yes.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   You know, personally,
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.080]   I don't think I could have a diet without carbs.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.840]   I love chocolate too much.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   For me eating, it's a pleasure of life.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.040]   I love my carbs.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.560]   I love my sugar.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.200]   However, if you talk about diet,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   I don't have a specific diet,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.840]   but recently what I'm trying to do is
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.560]   the days that I do not work out,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.400]   I only eat once.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.800]   That's kind of my rules.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.480]   Plus I try to respect 16/8
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.480]   and do my three day fast four time a year.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.160]   But the rest of the thing,
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.400]   I let myself loose
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.520]   because I don't think I would be happy
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.520]   if I don't give myself the right to eat.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.960]   For me personally, I love to eat so much.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.800]   Next.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.960]   And you talk about diet, carnivore diet.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.880]   It's very interesting because a few years ago,
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.240]   I went to Africa in Masai Mara
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   and it's a tribe in East Africa.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.960]   And I went to visit them.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.000]   I did a safari.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.800]   And I talked to them and these guys,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.920]   their diet is 99% carnivore.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.880]   That's crazy.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.320]   And you should see they're very beautiful people.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.440]   Shredded like, some people would say,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.280]   "Oh, it's genetic."
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.440]   I'm like, "Yeah, maybe it's genetic."
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.680]   But I mean, think about the Eskimos also.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.440]   Most of their diet is on fish, right?
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.880]   So I believe it can be done.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.120]   I believe it can be done,
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.960]   like an exclusive carnivore diet.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.560]   And I think I'm gonna try it pretty soon
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.560]   just to have the experience,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.640]   to see how it feels like.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.080]   - Well, you're gonna hang out with Joe.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.200]   Be careful bringing it up
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.000]   because he'll convince you to forever switch to carnivore.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.560]   Definitely, he loves it.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.160]   I mean, but just like you, I think he loves food.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.640]   So he can't ever stay on carnivore.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.320]   It was funny 'cause we went to an Italian restaurant together
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.480]   and I still only eat meat.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   Like I love the constraints of discipline.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.440]   That's partially why I like carnivore.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.400]   I like saying no to food that is delicious.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.720]   But part of the problem is that
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   I don't know how to moderate.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.680]   You said chocolate.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.240]   I don't know how to have one chocolate.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.360]   Is that something you're able to do?
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.880]   Have like in moderation?
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.600]   - No, it's when I have an opportunity, I do it.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.200]   I don't have any, I'm an extremist person.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.560]   That's the thing.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:32.200]   When I have a chance, I just eat.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.040]   I go too much.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.680]   And that's what I like about my life.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.000]   That's what I like about fasting
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.560]   because probably if I would not have discovered fasting,
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.720]   eating chocolate would give me cramps
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.800]   and all sorts of problems.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.000]   'Cause people on ulcer colitis,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   normally they cannot eat chocolate.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.520]   They cannot drink alcohol.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.960]   But I believe because I'm fasting,
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.840]   that's the reason why I'm medication free.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.040]   I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.720]   But I have to do that fasting.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.120]   And now it became to a point
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   that it's no longer hard for me.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.200]   It's like normal.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.840]   I don't even force myself.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.120]   It's easy.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.760]   Some of my friends think I'm insane.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   But I tell them it's like when you get used to it,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.360]   it becomes like an habit.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.400]   And I know that on Targheta,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.520]   like our ancestor did not eat three times a day.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.120]   It's not true.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.400]   They ate when they could.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.240]   And when they eat,
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.760]   they feed themselves as much as they can
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.200]   until the next time.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.760]   'Cause they didn't know when they could eat again.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:46.080]   So I think that's how we're built,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.240]   to have this similar lifestyle.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.800]   - If we could take a step back
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.520]   to the discussion about fear a little bit.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.120]   So Mike Tyson talks about this process
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.000]   of him walking to the ring.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.160]   He sounds similar to you in many ways
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.240]   of the anxiety and the fear that he experiences.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.000]   And he has this sort of story that he tells
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.040]   about walking to the ring and being supremely afraid.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.440]   But as he walks and gets closer and steps in,
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.800]   he finds the confidence and becomes supremely confident.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.520]   I think he calls himself like a god.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.040]   I feel like a god in the ring.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.400]   Do you go through a similar process
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.880]   of finding the confidence?
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.520]   - Well, yes.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.820]   And I use a James Lange theory.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.160]   So what I do is,
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.200]   because I'm not afraid to admit that I'm afraid.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.820]   And in the beginning of my career,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.080]   I really thought, I asked myself,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.560]   because I was very good in mixed martial arts,
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.080]   but I really thought I wasn't made for this
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   because the idea of fighting didn't make me happy.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.040]   It's something like I was forced to do
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.680]   in order to keep that lifestyle that I have
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.800]   and achieve my goal,
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.680]   perhaps one day to make enough money to retire.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.960]   And that was my dream.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.240]   But when I was looking around the gym where I was training,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.880]   most of my training partner, they were happy.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.720]   They were excited.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.560]   And sometime I corner a lot of guys and they're happy
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.600]   and they're in the locker room.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   They don't react the same way I do.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.340]   Some perhaps does,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.560]   but if you see me in the locker room,
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.840]   like when I get like my last fight with Michael Bisping,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.100]   just to give you an example,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.400]   in my last fight with Michael Bisping,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.680]   because it's fresh, it's the one that is the most recent,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.360]   but it's always the same thing.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.040]   My last fight, Bisping, again in the locker room,
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   I had like three guys that I trained with,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.560]   Mickey Gall, Eamon Zahabi and Joseph Duffy.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.400]   They all lost.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.100]   It was like my locker room was basically cursed.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.320]   When you're in a locker room
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.360]   and people from your locker room leave for a fight
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.320]   and then they come back, it's kind of a momentum.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.640]   You know, you shake and yeah, good job.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.480]   Now it's my turn.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.560]   It's kind of a team brotherhood sort of thing.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.560]   So the atmosphere in my locker room was pretty bad.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:30.540]   It was like going to a, you know, like a funeral.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.320]   So I was very scared.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.880]   And before every fight, I asked myself always,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.240]   shit, what the hell I'm doing here?
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.100]   Why did I choose to come back?
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.940]   Oh my God.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.340]   And I'm freaking out.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:51.380]   However, I'm putting on a mask like I'm acting
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.680]   because if I don't do that, it will reflect on my coaches.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.700]   And if my coach, the confidence of my coaches is affected,
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.300]   it will reflect on me.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.580]   So I need to feel strong.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.580]   I need to make them believe that I'm excited to be there
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.960]   and I'm happy to be there.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.380]   So this sort of play start when I get,
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.260]   when I first step in the locker room,
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.780]   even though I feel completely different,
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.140]   but that's how I play it.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.140]   Normally the fight day, I never feel 100%.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.440]   I always feel exhausted, tired.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.920]   My highs are hitching because I don't sleep enough
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.500]   the few nights before, because I'm constantly rehearsing
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.540]   scenarios that might happen in the fight.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:42.540]   So mentally, it's not that I'm not on top.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.060]   - But you keep all that to yourself.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.620]   - I keep it to myself and I'm lying to everybody around me.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.340]   But everybody knows, you know?
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.620]   Ferraz, John, they know Freddie Rose,
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.780]   they've been with me for a long time,
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.780]   so they know what's going on,
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.420]   but at least I'm lying to them.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.000]   I'm like, "Hey, I'm feeling great."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.900]   So, and seeing all my training partner,
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.620]   like very disappointed because they lost their fight.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.800]   Some were badly hurt as well.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.420]   It was hard.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.140]   So, and I remember I get, I start to warm up and everything.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.300]   And as you start to warm up, you become a different person
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.420]   because, you know, we know that certain posture
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.980]   and yoga can affect your mental state.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.220]   But I would say it's a little bit the same thing
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.280]   in fighting, you know?
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.740]   Like when you started hitting the pads,
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.220]   your muscle memory, your instincts comes back
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.500]   and you remember that you're good at this, you know?
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.940]   And your confidence start to grow.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.020]   And as seeing your trainers holding the pad
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.540]   and repeating your moves,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.620]   it makes you also remember all the sacrifice
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.860]   you have done through your training camp.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.980]   And confidence come from how you prepared yourself.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:59.060]   And even you're afraid, you can be confident
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:26:59.900]   in the same time.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.340]   Being afraid and being confident is two different thing.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.140]   And before every fight, just right before I walk in,
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.500]   it's when I'm scared, I go in the bathroom
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.740]   and I look at myself in the mirror.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.900]   I used to have a bandana and a gi,
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.260]   but now I didn't have this for my last fight
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.140]   because of the new Reebok deal they had.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.260]   But I did the same rehearsal that I always do.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.260]   I look at myself in the mirror
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.020]   and I start to compliment myself.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.240]   Like, even if I don't believe it,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.660]   I'm starting to trying to believe it as I am.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.980]   I'm finding all the reason why I'm going to win the fight.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.260]   And all my trainer knows that before every fight,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.540]   when the guy from the UFC goes,
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.220]   step in my room and says, "St. Pierre, you're up next."
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.660]   I always take a few minute to do that same rehearsal.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.460]   And I tell myself, I'm going to win this fight
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.820]   because I'm better.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.740]   And I'm very cocky about myself.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.060]   I'm telling all the reasons that why I'm going to win.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.980]   I got a better team, I made more sacrifice.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.780]   I'm faster, I'm more powerful, way more athletic.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.500]   My fighting IQ is better than him.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.900]   I got a strategy on point that he's never going to be able
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.500]   to keep up with and this and that.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   And I was telling myself, I'm going to show these young kids
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.740]   how things should be done.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.380]   You know, I tried to boost myself.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.300]   Yeah, try to boost yourself.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.500]   And you start to believing it, you become a different person.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.580]   So when you walk out the bathroom, now rock and roll.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.260]   Now I really believe it for real.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.260]   You know, like I'm still scared, but I believe it for real.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.380]   And that's the transformation that happened for me
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.220]   right there.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   And from there to the fight, until the fight is over,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.900]   I call it cruise control.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.300]   Because you don't have time to think in a fight.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.940]   If you're trying to think, you're missing the opportunity.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.660]   So that's how I see it for myself.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.980]   - So at that point, you stop thinking
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.140]   and you just go cruise control, autopilot.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.660]   - Trust yourself, you know, trust yourself
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.900]   because you repeated all the scenarios, you know.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.900]   So everything that you have done, it's inside your computer.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.420]   Your brain is programmed to react accordingly
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.460]   to certain situations.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.500]   And it's not the night of the fight that you'll tell yourself
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.700]   oh, finally, I'm going to do this if you do this now.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.460]   No, if you have not practiced it before, you're screwed.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:22.460]   It's the preparation, the repetition that makes it happen.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.340]   - What about like the really difficult moments in a fight
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   where you are tested to your limits, essentially.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.220]   Usually it's cardio related exhaustion, right?
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.420]   Where you have to ask yourself that same question.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.580]   It's like, why the hell am I doing this?
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.540]   - Yeah.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.620]   - Do you experience those?
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.980]   Or are you able to ride through the autopilot?
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.740]   And if you do, like, what do you do in those moments?
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.660]   - Never in a fight.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.260]   When I'm in a fight, when the fight is on,
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.380]   I never change my mind.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.260]   I go until the end.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.460]   However, for example, my first fight with BJ Penn,
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.020]   I had a terrible first round.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.020]   So I had to switch gear.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.740]   That happened sometimes.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.380]   But it's part of my plan.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.900]   I always have a plan B, plan A, plan B, plan C.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.740]   You need to have that.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.780]   If fighters goes into a fight thinking,
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.980]   oh, I'm going to do this, this, this,
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.060]   and they don't have a plan B, if this doesn't work,
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.820]   that's mean they're not well prepared.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.860]   If you talk to me before every fight,
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.020]   I can, like, in 30 seconds, give you my whole strategy.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.300]   You know, for BJ Penn, my first fight with BJ Penn was,
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.180]   oh, I'm going to keep it standing up,
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.140]   keep the fight from the outside, you know,
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.780]   because I'm faster than him.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.580]   Then the fight with BJ Penn start.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.060]   I found out that I was not faster than him.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.180]   And I found out that his reaction time
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.420]   was better than mine.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.620]   So I got beat up the first round.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.780]   And I got a bloody nose and everything.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.380]   So my plan B was now I'm going to wrestle him.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.700]   You know, I'm going to wrestle him and, you know,
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.740]   make him tired and trying to put him down.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.540]   And that's how I beat him, because I switched gear,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.700]   you know, but if you can't do that,
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.660]   if you cannot find a way to become the perfect nemesis
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.620]   to your opponent, you might win a few fight,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.140]   but you're going to find,
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.020]   you're going to fight someone sooner or later
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.420]   that will give you a lot of trouble.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.140]   - So that's where the anxiety pays off.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.900]   You're anticipating all the ways it goes wrong.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.260]   So you've developed a plan B and plan C.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.420]   Hi, you know, we talked a lot with,
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.020]   like John Donaher, who you work with.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.860]   It's interesting.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.660]   I don't think I've heard him talk about plan B and plan C.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.900]   He usually has a really clear plan A,
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.660]   an entire system of plan A.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.900]   I don't think I've heard him.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.500]   We've had a good discussion about it in,
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.900]   over some cheeseburgers.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   And he was kind of espousing the value of mastering escapes.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.700]   So when you find yourself in bad situations,
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.900]   being exceptionally good at finding ways
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.460]   out of those bad situations,
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.340]   and that's a way of dominance.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.020]   There's nothing, there's no better way
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.580]   to dominate your opponent, according to him,
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.820]   than to show that they can't possibly hurt you
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.340]   no matter how bad the position is.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.180]   It's like, as opposed to a physical dominance,
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.700]   it's a psychological dominance.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.100]   It's very interesting.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.100]   But I wonder if he has plan B and plan C in his mind too.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.660]   - You know, in mixed martial arts,
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.100]   sometimes it's like in science,
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.460]   sometimes you can make a mistake, you know?
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.820]   Like every human can make mistakes, you know?
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.700]   There's certain sport or a certain situation that you,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.620]   if there's a mistake made, that's it, exactly.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.860]   Sometimes it's the case in MMA,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.180]   but sometimes you're able to redeem yourself.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:33:00.180]   And if you look at the fight with BJ Penn one that I had,
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.860]   which was probably one of the most competitive fight,
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.340]   and it was probably the,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.780]   it was the fight that I got the most damage,
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.740]   and I was messed up.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.020]   It took me three days,
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.100]   like two, three days to recuperate from that fight.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.980]   I was really damaged.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.900]   And my first fight versus my second fight,
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.940]   I made a lot of adjustment
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.700]   because I have learned from my first fight.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.220]   And also I had a guy, one thing people don't know,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.140]   like they talk about fighters having secret weapons.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   See, for me, my secret weapons was not,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.180]   like some is that they use like certain,
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.060]   like different things.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.860]   For me, it was knowledge.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.420]   I had a guy in Montreal, he was measuring frames.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.940]   He's not a scientist, he's a friend of Ferras and I.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.700]   And what he does, he watch fight and he measure frames.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.900]   The way he does it is when you watch a fight
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.940]   and one of the guy throw a punch,
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.100]   he cut the picture by frame, the video by frame.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.580]   Clack, clack, clack, clack.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.900]   So he's able to see which fighter
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.860]   has better reaction time than others.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.420]   And BJ Penn, he found out that BJ Penn,
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.340]   of all the UFC roster at the time when he was in his prime,
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.700]   he had probably the best reaction time of all.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.980]   According to him, Lyoto Mashido was the second one.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.820]   But BJ Penn was the first one.
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.500]   So I knew that if I would try to go first,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.620]   because I always been the fastest guy
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.660]   normally when I fight someone.
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.300]   But when I fought BJ Penn, I tried to go first
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.780]   and he was always able to,
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:34.060]   like I never, was never able to touch him with my jab
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.980]   and he came back with a counter punch.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   However, because of what he told me,
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.500]   I knew that BJ Penn has a very fast reaction time,
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.980]   but had a very poor reset time.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.940]   To him, the way he described it to me,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.940]   he's like, "Your nervous system is like a muscle."
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.340]   BJ Penn was so fast, but he's like more like a sprinter.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.140]   So what I did the second fight,
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.380]   when I fought BJ Penn, I made him flinch.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.180]   Like I fake a lot, so I make him react and flinch.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.780]   So all that reaction time that he used to flinch
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.140]   was not used properly to avoid my punches.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:14.060]   So I burn, I load up his nervous system
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.780]   with a lot of information and fake
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.180]   and to make him flinch and pretending
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.620]   I was kicking and wrestling.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.660]   So he got overwhelmed and he got tired very, very fast.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.900]   So that's how I beat him.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.900]   People sometimes they don't know really
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.020]   what's the strategy behind the thing.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.500]   They only see the physical part.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.260]   But when you fight someone, if I fight you,
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.980]   I look at you in the eyes,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.020]   there's a lot of things that going on between you and I.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.540]   I can look down here, bam, jab you in the face.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.620]   The audience will not see these little detail,
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.060]   but you will see it.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.500]   And that's what makes the magic during a fight.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.900]   The relation that you have with the opponent,
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.660]   like the mental game, what you make him believe,
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.580]   those little thing, I use a lot of those.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.620]   If you've talked to a lot of my opponent,
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.980]   they'll tell you like, I use a lot of these little thing.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.820]   Like I look down at Banner, I go up
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   or I am pretending I want to attack you,
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.780]   so I make you flinch.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.140]   But in reality, I'm just doing this
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.180]   because I want to rest, I want to recuperate and I'm tired.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.860]   - How much is, people talk about that with poker,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.860]   for example, how much is the value of this?
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.100]   So like some people argue that poker
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.100]   is more about the betting, just the money.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.060]   It's just how much you bet and so on.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.500]   So that would be more like the analogy there
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.460]   with fighting would be just strictly
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.420]   the physical movement of your body.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.100]   And then a lot of people argue that there's a lot here
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.620]   in the way you look and the little movements in the face.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.020]   So do you think you're communicating
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.700]   with your opponent when you look at them?
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.140]   - There's no way to know for sure, 100%.
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.500]   And I'm by no means psychic, nothing like that.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.140]   And I don't believe in that at all.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.580]   The only thing is I know through looking
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.420]   through the eyes of my opponent,
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.620]   when he's afraid and when he gives up on me.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.940]   I've been accused very often in my career
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.420]   to not take enough risk, to not finish my opponent.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.300]   But the reason why I didn't finish my opponent
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.140]   is because I saw in his eyes that he gave up,
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.780]   he gave me the fight and I'm winning the fight.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.780]   So it's not up to me, it's not to me to make it,
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.660]   to try to sacrifice myself, trying to finish him.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.860]   Perhaps if I do that, I will open up for him
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.060]   to capitalize on my mistake.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.820]   It's up to him to make a risk.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.420]   So people, sometimes they don't understand
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.100]   that this is the art of fighting, my friend.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.260]   Like if I'm winning the fight, like in hockey,
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.980]   in ice hockey, if you're winning the game
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.220]   and it's the third period,
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.060]   it's at the end of the third period,
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.460]   you're not gonna take out your goal
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.980]   and they're trying to score another goal
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:56.900]   because winning five to three or five to four
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.900]   is the same thing.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.700]   Same thing in MMA, we make a living out of this.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.820]   And sometimes, as sad as it can be,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.740]   you wanna save yourself for another day,
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.940]   you wanna minimize the damage.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.700]   But if he knows he's losing the fight,
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.460]   it's up to him to take the risk, it's not up to me.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.340]   So I'm a good counter fighter,
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.020]   I use a lot of my attack or counter strike
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.780]   or reactive takedown or proactive takedown.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.420]   That's my specialty.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   So I'm not gonna, I'd have no desire to sacrifice myself
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.700]   trying to finish my opponent if he want to,
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.260]   if perhaps I might give him the opportunity
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.980]   to capitalize on me.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.660]   It's not smart to do that.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.380]   And very often when I fight someone,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.860]   I can read him, I see the fear in his eyes.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.500]   Now I'm like, I got you now.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.460]   He's very desperate, doesn't mean I have to put my guard down
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.140]   because he's gonna be desperate,
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.780]   but I know I'm beating you.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.820]   And I know I'm beating you,
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.380]   I'm just gonna do what I need.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.260]   If I have a chance, of course, I'll knock him out,
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.180]   but I'm not gonna try to sacrifice myself to knock him out.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.420]   And if you do that,
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.900]   maybe one day you'll make a mistake and you'll get dropped
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.260]   and you'll tell yourself, I shoot, I just got brain damage,
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.820]   maybe I'm never gonna come back the same,
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.460]   maybe I ruined my career or,
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.820]   it's a very serious game that we're playing,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.500]   it's very dangerous.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.460]   - In the face of that risk,
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.260]   I mean, Mike Tyson talked about,
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:33.140]   "When the opponent looks away, he knows he's got them."
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.020]   That he's broken.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.940]   For a person like me who has trouble
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.260]   making eye contact with people, there's truth to that.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.040]   I mean, there's truth to that,
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.940]   that there's an animal nature to us looking away.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.180]   I mean, you could see that the way the body language,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.260]   the way the eyes move between two animals going at it
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.780]   in the wild when two lions fight or two whatever fight,
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.620]   there's a certain beta move when you've been defeated.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.500]   - Yes, or one thing when I know that,
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.140]   that when it happened, one of the thing
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.060]   is when I just make a feint and the guy flinch like crazy,
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.860]   that's mean he's really scared of me.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.500]   It's a little bit like you're doing this,
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.060]   that guy flinch a little bit, or you're doing this,
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.500]   he's flinch, that's mean you hurt him
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.860]   and he doesn't wanna get hurt again.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.380]   So he's really trying to run away
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:34.180]   and not winning the fight anymore, but not losing.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.740]   So sort of surviving the five round.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.420]   And it's hard to finish a guy who doesn't wanna fight,
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.700]   a guy who's not fighting anymore to win
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.460]   and is fighting to not lose.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.220]   And the proof of that, if you don't believe me,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.140]   just look the reign of all the greatest champion in UFC.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.940]   I don't care who they are, John Jones,
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.420]   like you could clearly see that
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.580]   in the beginning of their reign,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.260]   they could finish a lot of their opponent,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.300]   same as me in the beginning,
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.020]   I was finishing a lot of my opponent.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.860]   But there's a time that the entire UFC roster
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.460]   is studying you and they found a ways to,
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.620]   perhaps not beating you, but they found a way
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.500]   to navigate through the fight in a way
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.300]   that they minimize the damage.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.700]   So it's a big difference between fighting to win
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.140]   and fighting to not lose.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.980]   - You said that there's a difference
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   between a fighter and a martial artist.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.380]   So now we were talking about fighting,
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.220]   you're considered by many to be
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.820]   one of the greatest fighters of all time.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.820]   But you've said that there's a difference
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.860]   between a fighter and a martial artist.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.620]   A fighter is training for a purpose, he has a fight.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.100]   I'm a martial artist, I don't train for a fight.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.100]   I train for myself, I'm training all the time.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.540]   My goal is perfection, but I will never reach perfection.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.960]   So what to you does it mean to be a martial artist?
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.940]   - Martial artist is because that lifestyle
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.540]   that I have has been introduced to me
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.780]   and the seed has been planted to my mind
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.580]   a long, long time ago by my father.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:15.100]   I do not train because I have a fight,
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.220]   I will always train.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.300]   Even now it kind of amuse me to see that
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.740]   a lot of people, because I'm still training,
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.740]   because I love the science of fighting.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.180]   I do not like to fight, but I love the science of it.
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.300]   And I will always do it as long as I can do it.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.100]   People think I'm gonna make a comeback and everything.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.100]   I'm about to get to 40 years old, you know?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.140]   Like it's, I'm, you know, like.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.860]   - Well, Mike Tyson--
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.820]   - I don't wanna fight in a cage at 40 years old.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.280]   I mean, some people have done it, they did it very well,
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.540]   but I'm not one of them.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.240]   I feel a little bit to me that,
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.480]   and you never say never,
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.760]   I feel like to me, like it's a little,
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.840]   like a kid that you play with a string when he's young,
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.040]   like, (imitates drum roll)
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.400]   then he's five years old, (imitates drum roll)
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.640]   six years old, seven years old, eight years old.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.840]   And then I'm always like,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.960]   what the hell I'm doing here?
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.080]   And I'm too old for this.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.880]   Like, I've done it, you know?
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   And I got out of it on top and I'm healthy,
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.020]   which is the most important thing right now,
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.820]   I'm touching wood and I'm wealthy.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.420]   I beat the game, you know what I mean?
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.300]   In a way, like, that's not to be cocky, but I did it.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.100]   And I wish more fighters could do the same thing.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.860]   I wish, but it's unfortunate because a lot of them,
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.620]   they stay there and hang out for too long
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.180]   and they get badly hurt.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:44.180]   They get beaten and broken, you know?
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.380]   And they finish broke as well.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.180]   Because the lifestyle you have when you're a pro athlete,
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.780]   it's crazy, you know, it's unbelievable.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.080]   However, everything that goes up in life goes down
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.460]   and you need to plan your future, you know?
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.060]   So for me, if some guys have the same mentality as me
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.180]   and they're watching us right now,
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.000]   I would say if you do it because you're just good at it,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.060]   you like the money, the advantage,
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.200]   the freedom that it gives you,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.700]   but you don't necessarily like to fight,
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.500]   when you're done, you finish on top, you know,
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.580]   go cash out and get out of here.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.420]   - Walk away. - Yes.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.940]   - That's really hard to do.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.660]   - However, Alex, it's not everybody
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.380]   that does it for that reason.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.800]   Some people generally love to fight, love to compete.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.820]   So they do it because they love it, you know,
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.380]   or they do it because of the money.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.780]   But if you don't love it, if you don't like to fight
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.940]   because it's very stressful and you don't enjoy,
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.780]   you enjoy the training perhaps,
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.700]   but you don't like to fight,
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.340]   you do it because it's part of what you need to do
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.220]   in order to keep that lifestyle.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.900]   And you know, like you don't need the money,
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.580]   say get out of here, man.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.700]   If you're in your prime, get out of here
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.540]   because if you don't, you'll hurt your own legacy,
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.420]   you'll damage your health.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.860]   It's very sad.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:02.240]   And it's a sad business, you know what I mean?
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.620]   It's like a lot of,
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.500]   one of the place where,
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.820]   is one of the most happiest place for me to go
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.260]   and the most saddest place for me to go,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.380]   it's in the gym, it's in Tristar, Montreal.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.900]   Because it's one of the happiest place for me to go
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.640]   because I can go train and do what I love to do.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.460]   But it's also a very sad place for me
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.500]   because after, when I'm about to leave,
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.020]   there's always a bunch of young kid that comes
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.420]   or guys that are around 30, 33 years old.
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:36.260]   And they comes to me and say,
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.940]   "Hey, George, you have some advice for me?"
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.020]   And I look at them.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.180]   And if they're my friend, they're real close friend of mine,
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.260]   I'll tell them the truth in their face.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.580]   And I've done it many time and it was not well received.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.540]   But if they're not my friend, I have to,
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.620]   it's always an advice about fighting
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.460]   and I answer their question, it's my pleasure.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.420]   But the truth, if they want me to tell the truth,
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.740]   the big majority of them,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.580]   I would tell them, I said,
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.300]   "Listen, man, you're in maybe three,
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.580]   like on a losing street of three fight.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.260]   You're 30, 33 years old.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.900]   I think you should think about doing something else
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.220]   in your life, have other goals,
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.220]   because you're not gonna make it."
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:26.220]   And I've seen that movie before and it's a very sad ending.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.060]   And I'm sad to tell you the truth
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.180]   because you're not gonna make the money.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.460]   Just choose something.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.900]   But if I tell them that, they're gonna be angry at me
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.740]   because they're gonna be like,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.740]   "Oh, you, you make it and you think I cannot make it.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.340]   So it's kind of, they're gonna think I'm cocky."
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.980]   But I was lucky to make it.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.580]   You know what, the star were all aligned,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.340]   but at one point you need to be able to have a plan B.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.380]   You know, like some parent,
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.340]   they come to see me with their kids.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.940]   "Hey, this is the future world champion in UFC.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.940]   And what advice would you give him?"
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.420]   I always tell the same thing.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.780]   And it does not make everybody happy when I say that.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.620]   I say, I go to the kid, I say, "Are you good at school?"
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.740]   Say, "Stay at school.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.380]   School is very important for you.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.980]   Stay educated."
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.900]   "Yeah, do boxing, martial arts, a great sport.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.300]   Stay in shape,
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.180]   but don't put your eggs all in the same basket."
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.740]   And the parents sometimes are angry when I say,
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.260]   not angry, but I can see in their eyes,
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.380]   they're like, they kind of surprised.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.140]   And it's not because I made it
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.300]   that I will tell their kid to follow the same path
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.140]   that I did.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.340]   I went to school too.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.220]   I've studied.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.660]   I dropped out of school
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.580]   when I had my first world championship fight
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.260]   against Matt Hughes.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.340]   But before that, I was at school.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.820]   So I had another, you know,
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.620]   another way to go if things would not have gone
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.780]   the same, the way I wanted.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.060]   But the problem, and I'm saying that,
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.820]   it's not only about boxing and MMA.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.100]   I'm talking about hockey, basketball, baseball,
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.380]   same thing.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.660]   Maybe it's one on a hundred thousand that make it.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.820]   And I'm saying, I'm saying that make it.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.820]   When I'm saying make it, that means they can retire
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.020]   and have enough money for the rest of his life.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.220]   Because it's a sad story.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.820]   The only people only heard about the people that makes it,
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.300]   but a lot of fighter, even a UFC champion,
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.460]   in boxing champion, even in football, basketball,
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.420]   I don't care, the big names,
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.940]   when they retire, they have zero.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.780]   They're bankrupt, my friend.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.500]   And it's a very sad, sad story and a sad reality
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.500]   that most people are not aware of.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.620]   - But having other paths in life actually
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.300]   can also increase the chance of you dominating
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.700]   and like reaching the highest peak in your main thing.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.580]   I mean, Jimmy Pedro, I don't know if you know who that is.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.860]   He's a judo coach in America.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.860]   He was, he says that to all of his athletes
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.340]   is to make sure that you go.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.460]   He has a lot of, Kayla Harrison,
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.780]   two-time Olympic gold medalist.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.060]   He has a lot of Olympic medalists.
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.340]   But basically there's something about going to school,
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.900]   like having, forget school, any other avenue in life
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.300]   that gives you the freedom to go all out in your main.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.300]   Like that, you know, you're doing it for the right reasons.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.900]   You're not stuck.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.500]   It clears the mind to where you're free
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.340]   to be the best in the world.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.180]   - Yes.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.580]   - As opposed to kind of, you have to.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.220]   I mean, different people are motivated by different things.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   So sometimes some people like having their back to the wall
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.660]   and that's the only option they have.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.420]   But most people, I think, excel when you have other options.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.900]   I think it's a distraction
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.060]   and I think it's important to have a distraction.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.340]   When you say that, I think about one of my coach,
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.700]   John Danaher.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.700]   He put his academic background experience into Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.860]   And that, for me, that's why he's the best teacher
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.940]   I ever had.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.420]   He's incredible.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.700]   He start teaching me when I even couldn't speak
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.820]   much English at the time.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.580]   And I was able to communicate and understand, you know,
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.580]   that's how good he is.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.460]   But I truly believe that most of athletes,
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.820]   especially in sport like mixed martial art,
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.380]   train way too much.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.900]   If I could go back and talk to a young George,
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.580]   I would tell him, I say, you do way too much volume.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.940]   You train way too hard.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.660]   Train smarter, it's more important.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.700]   And I think sometimes we underestimate
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:27.220]   the benefit of recuperation.
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.020]   Because I think we assimilate the information
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.380]   that we learn during a training when we recuperate
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.660]   and not during the training itself.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:42.020]   And this whole mentality of harder, heavier,
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:47.020]   you know, like it's good for someone who's lazy.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.460]   But if you're an elite athlete, most of the time,
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.100]   you know, like you're not always, but most of the time
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.500]   it's because you're not lazy.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.900]   And a lot of guys, sometimes they're elite athlete,
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.740]   champions, and you'll hear people say,
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.900]   oh, I can't believe he's very gifted, but he doesn't work.
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.180]   But perhaps it's not really,
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.420]   because perhaps it's because we don't understand.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.900]   Perhaps he's doing the right thing
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.860]   and it's us who's working too much and too hard.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.860]   That's what I think.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:21.620]   There's a guy I train with, he made me think about it.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.700]   His name is Mansour Barnawee.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.940]   He's going to be a future star.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.940]   He's an incredible fighter.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.940]   He train once a day.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.140]   And he asked me sometime advice when he came to Montreal.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:33.980]   He's from France.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:34.820]   You'll hear about him.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.260]   He's very good.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:41.220]   And I saw him in the morning at TriStar
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.980]   and I said, okay, I'll see you perhaps later
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:43.820]   in the other trainings.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.220]   Oh no, I only train once a day.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:50.020]   And he kind of wait for me to give him like,
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:54.940]   not an approval, but like to see how I react.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.860]   Or, you know, I don't know.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.460]   It was kind of a strange feeling, but I told myself
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.900]   at that point, I kind of had an awakening
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:06.900]   and I told myself, man, maybe he's doing the right thing.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:10.580]   Because a lot of people would say, for example,
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.180]   oh, that's a lazy way of doing it.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.700]   But perhaps it's the best way to do it.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.420]   I'm not saying training once a day
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.580]   is the best way to do it.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.460]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.820]   I'm saying that everybody's different,
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.020]   but for him, it works beautifully.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.900]   And I wouldn't change anything, you know,
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.780]   like if I would be him, because he's improving like crazy.
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.340]   - Yeah, and ultimately the bigger picture there
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:40.460]   is to do something that everyone else says is stupid.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:44.140]   It's like the fasting thing that a lot of people would say,
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.940]   a lot of nutritional experts would say
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.420]   that that's a dumb way.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.420]   You know, if you want to be an MMA fighter,
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.620]   you should be eating like many times a day.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.060]   You should be starting every day with oatmeal.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.460]   You should be carving up constantly,
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.740]   but that's not necessarily true for everybody.
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.220]   And it's possible.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.180]   I'm sure there's actually now a few MMA fighters
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.220]   that are carnivore only.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.420]   It's possible.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.660]   - I used to eat right before training
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.100]   and it didn't bother me.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:16.940]   However, now my first training that I do normally
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.260]   in average around noon, 11 a.m.,
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.860]   I haven't eaten anything when I do my first training.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.580]   And it feels to me that I'm much more clear.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.220]   I'm much more clear in my mind.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.820]   I'm much more creative.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.420]   I feel better.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.980]   Yeah, it's a big difference.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.420]   I just wish I would have known that before.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.140]   - Well, it's fascinating the role of the mind
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:41.980]   in all of this.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.700]   How important is it for your mind to be clear,
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.460]   to really think deeply?
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.460]   There's a Jidoka American named Travis Stevens.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:58.980]   I remember he said something that the right kind
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.860]   of practice is when your mind is exhausted
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.380]   at the end of it,
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:07.660]   that you were constantly thinking through things.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.700]   Like your body shouldn't be exhausted first.
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.940]   Your mind should be exhausted first.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.280]   It's really fascinating.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.440]   So people think about training hard.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.100]   A successful practice is where you walk away
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.620]   just overwhelmed how much you had to think.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.260]   It's fascinating framing of a successful practice.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.300]   - It's true.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.300]   Travis Stevens was one of my main training partner
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.780]   when I got ready for my fight
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.860]   with Nick Diaz and Carlos Condit.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:43.060]   He drove every Friday from, I believe, Boston.
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:46.100]   It's like a six hour drive.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.620]   Drive to the gym in Montreal,
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:55.620]   train with us an hour and a half, drive back.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.220]   (laughs)
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:01.220]   He's got such an amazing discipline.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.500]   I was so happy for him when he won the medal
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.780]   at the Olympic game.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.780]   Man, what a well-deserved accomplishment.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.460]   It's unbelievable.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.020]   It paid off.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.340]   I was so happy for him.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:20.500]   And every time we got to the gym,
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.980]   he was waiting for me in the kneeling position
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.940]   like a soldier.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.180]   (laughs)
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:30.180]   I was like, my God, this guy is made of steel.
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.620]   And after training, I always offer him,
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.300]   I say, hey, Travis, I know you like to train with that
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.380]   because in Montreal, they have very good judo team,
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.460]   Nicholas Gill and all those guy.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.740]   And I say, if you wanna stay, I'll get you the hotel.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.660]   Anything you want, it's like, no, no, I gotta go back.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.060]   I gotta have another training later.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.580]   I'm like, not only that he trained with us,
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.220]   he had to go back because he had another training.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.300]   I'm like, this is insane.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.700]   - And he's gone through a huge number of injuries.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.940]   So he's also an innovator because, I mean,
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.060]   it's difficult to say, but for American judo,
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.660]   there's not many high level judoka.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.060]   So if you want to be the, like,
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.580]   fight with the best in the world, you have to be alone.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.540]   It's a lonely journey, actually.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.620]   It's kind of sad.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.780]   It's much easier to be in Japan where everybody's a killer.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.020]   When you're alone at it, it's a difficult journey.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.260]   And it's funny, we talked about kind of,
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:32.260]   there's some sports where a mistake is, that's it.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.620]   You can't recover from a mistake.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.420]   I think judo oftentimes is one of those sports
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   and added on top of that is the Olympics.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.220]   Only every four years.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.980]   And Travis's story, he's the reason I,
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.660]   when I saw him in 2008, is I started martial arts.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:54.700]   I switched from like wrestling and street fighting
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.340]   to doing jujitsu and judo.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:02.300]   And I just saw so much guts and the, in 2000,
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:03.860]   I might be messing up the years here,
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.460]   but in the next Olympics, he fought
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:11.060]   and he lost on just the referee call.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:15.820]   Yeah, and just, he went to war and he just so much guts
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.540]   and just everything on the line and to lose
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.100]   and then to still persevere through all the injuries,
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.060]   through all of that,
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.260]   through incredibly difficult training sessions
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.100]   to go another four years and then compete
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.260]   and then win a medal.
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.620]   I mean, that guy is just,
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.140]   and like he clearly could have been very successful.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.460]   He's also an incredible jujitsu competitor.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.780]   So he could have switched to that, but he's stuck.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:45.540]   - In a lot of sport, when you're in elite,
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:48.940]   like for example, in Canada, ice hockey
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.940]   is the number one sport of the country.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.460]   Kids, when they're in elite, when they're young,
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.220]   they get chosen and they're kind of already
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.540]   known as a superstar.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.820]   You know, the school where they go
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.220]   and the program they follow,
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:06.700]   like I'm sure it's the same thing in US
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.700]   and basketball, baseball, perhaps American football,
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.940]   because they already chosen.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.020]   So they grew up with that,
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:21.020]   that it's a kid that superstar stardom, so to speak.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:26.260]   And it's already glass or glamorous, you know?
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:31.260]   However, in MMA, there's no MMA, judo, wrestling,
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.740]   like in America, because it's not our national sport.
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.860]   Actually, it's not like, even when I first started,
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.500]   it was not really well received by the media.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.340]   There's no glamor into it.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:48.660]   Now, I don't know, it seems like it's another era now.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:53.180]   And I feel sometimes that some people do it
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.300]   for the wrong reason.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:58.420]   Some people do it because of the glamor,
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.020]   because of the money.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.780]   But even if you're in elite and very good,
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.540]   the glamor and the money won't come in the beginning.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:12.540]   It's a very long grind before it start to come in.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.140]   And you need to make those sacrifices.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:19.900]   And it's a journey that where you will be tested,
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:23.300]   you will be hurt repetitively,
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.620]   and you're gonna have to reach the down deep
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.860]   and come back up.
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.380]   And then once you finally think you made it,
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.540]   you're gonna go back in the down deep again.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:38.540]   It's a very exhausting and discouraging adventure sometimes.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:43.180]   But if you hold on to your dream and you believe in it,
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:47.580]   and you have the stars are aligned, you're gonna make it.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.180]   That's why it's only a few people that make it.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:55.540]   And that's why I feel sometimes a lot of people
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.140]   in the new generation do it for the wrong reason.
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.540]   In my generation, because of sport,
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.420]   at first it was, there were no rules.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.860]   I felt it was more pure.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.980]   The people that did it was really because of the passion.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:11.820]   We didn't seek money and fame.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.060]   We did it because we wanted to be,
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.620]   I did it because I wanted to be the man.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.580]   I like to have the confidence that when I walk somewhere,
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.900]   I have the confidence that it's an illusion
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.740]   because nobody's faster than a bullet.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.860]   But I wanted to achieve it for myself.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.420]   And which today now,
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.220]   because I don't know if it's social media and all that,
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.940]   the world has changed.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.940]   The glamor, I feel it's a different thing right now.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.620]   - Yeah, if you get in it for the glamor or the money,
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.580]   you may not have the right amount of fuel
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.820]   to persevere through all the ups and downs.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.900]   - Yeah. - For sure.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   When you talk about motivation of money and glamor,
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.260]   a guy comes to mind,
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.980]   and I don't know how many wrestlers you know,
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.980]   but in Russia, there's a guy named Bovesy Seteev.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.740]   The Seteev brothers,
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.980]   one of the greatest freestyle wrestlers of all time.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.340]   But he also has, it's funny,
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.140]   he doesn't have many interviews.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.600]   One of my goals is to go out and talk to him in Russian,
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.900]   do an interview with him
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.460]   because he's exceptionally poetic and a deep thinker.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.300]   He's the kind of martial artist that you are
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.100]   in the way that it's not just about the different battles
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.680]   you've been through or whatever.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.500]   It's about the philosophy behind the way he approaches life.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.520]   Now he has spoken quite a bit about that the glamor,
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.340]   the fame, the money are all things that get in the way
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:48.020]   of the purity of the experience, the art,
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.060]   that the way to achieve greatness
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.020]   is to just lose yourself in the art
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.260]   of the actual combat.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.460]   In his case, it's wrestling.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.740]   And then kind of not to worry and actively make sure
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:07.740]   that you block out anybody who feeds you the narrative
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.380]   where you're supposed to be this famous person
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.420]   and all those kinds of things that he basically says,
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.500]   let others write your story.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.140]   Make sure that you just focus on the art.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.960]   And another person from that side of the world
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.140]   is of course, Khabib.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.460]   So he represents that side of the world.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.820]   And we were talking about walking away
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.460]   and most people not being able to walk away
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.140]   at the top as you have,
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:39.140]   but also now Khabib has, it looks like incredibly so.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.260]   So, I mean, maybe you can comment about
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.500]   what your thoughts are about Khabib,
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.740]   not bringing him out of being able to just walk away.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.300]   - You know, we talk about the gold very often.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.600]   Khabib is one of, isn't the argument
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.280]   because he has the most dominant carrier
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.240]   of all martial art, the guy.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.880]   Some guys can be named the gold for different reason,
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.800]   but Khabib for that reason, and he's undefeated.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.320]   I don't even know if he lost, he might have lost round,
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.360]   but he dominate all his opponent.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   It was ridiculous.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.100]   And such an incredible carrier that he had.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.040]   I love to watch him fight, he's incredible.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.120]   And when you talk about the art,
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.000]   when you say mixed martial art,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.240]   the idea of a flawless performance for me,
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.800]   everybody often when we say flawless performance
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.720]   thinks about a knockout, a brutal knockout.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   But for me, it's to be able to showcase beautiful technique,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.760]   like a beautiful takedown, beautiful submission,
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.740]   like something beautiful that,
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:03.120]   you know, when you look at, for example,
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.680]   Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan or like Stephen Curry,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.320]   even if you don't know nothing about basketball
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.720]   and you watch Michael Jordan,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.720]   you'll be like, wow, that's beautiful what he just did.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.280]   Like we talk about fighting and trying to say
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.160]   the word beautiful in fighting for certain people,
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.320]   it could sound kind of crazy, you know,
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   but I'm talking about the technique, a beautiful technique.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.280]   You know, for me, that's the goal.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.440]   You know, when I was fighting,
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.520]   it's not only to have a brutal knockout
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.280]   because some people are more gifted than others.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.360]   I'm saying gifted, some people are better than others
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.160]   in certain phase of fighting.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.520]   But for me, it was that, it was to showcase,
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.440]   to win, of course, but to showcase some beautiful technique
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.200]   that you can watch it and be like,
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.800]   wow, that was incredible, the timing he did it.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.440]   And when I think about Khabib Nurmagomedov,
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.040]   I see all the detail of his work,
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.880]   especially when he's got his opponent against the fence,
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.680]   that's like, that's his area of expertise
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.200]   where he's, to me, he's the best that ever did it
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.320]   in terms of that fighting style,
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.040]   that particular expertise that he has, it's just incredible.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.440]   - The flawless execution of that particular set of techniques.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.920]   - Yeah, and Conor McGregor at the accuracy.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.280]   The Spider, Anderson Silva was like,
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.600]   was I would say the most flamboyant of all, you know,
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.000]   like he was moving like the Matrix.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   Jon Jones was incredible in terms of creativity,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   spinning elbows and that, and he faced incredible adversity.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.680]   Dmitriy Ruzhansky was so complete.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.920]   You could bring, like he was slamming a guy to an armbar.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.040]   It was just unbelievable.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.680]   Like, he was like the complete fighter.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.200]   BJ Penn was like so flexible.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.880]   He did stuff with his body that like nobody could do.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.080]   His, the dexterity of his hips was just unbelievable.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.600]   Dominic Cruz, to me, it was incredible.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.800]   His footwork, his distance control.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.000]   So when you talk about like the GOAT,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.560]   Royce Gracie, another one,
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.040]   he did things that I think for me is the number one because-
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.000]   - Yeah, I gotta, and sorry to interrupt,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.280]   the hoist is a fascinating one.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.760]   I'd love to hear what you think about him,
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.560]   but many people consider you,
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.160]   most people consider you to be the number one
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.160]   greatest mixed martial arts fighter ever.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.560]   So it's fascinating to remove you from that list
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.520]   and continue this discussion and asking like,
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.600]   who do you think is the greatest fighter ever?
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.400]   You listed some amazing ones.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.280]   Hoist, you somehow skipped Fedor.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.400]   I'm very, as a Russian, I'm very offended.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.800]   - No, I was going to, there's so many.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.360]   Fedor is one as well.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.800]   Fedor, I think in his prime was like,
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.640]   when you say, when you talk about a name, for example,
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.160]   like we talk about him when he was in his prime.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.360]   Like when I talk, for example, about Anderson Silva,
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.320]   I'm not talking about the Anderson Silva
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.680]   who fought his last fight against Uriah Hall.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.080]   I'm talking about the Anderson Silva
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.800]   who knocked out Victor Belfer.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.320]   Yes, BJ Penn, same thing.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.920]   The problem is when fighters hang on
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.360]   for too long in the sport.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.200]   That's what happened.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   They kind of make people forget how good they were.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.160]   And it's very sad.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.960]   We talk about Fedor and just think about Stipe Miocic.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.080]   Miocic is probably the greatest heavyweight of all time.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.680]   With Fedor, I would really wonder
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.480]   who would have won this fight,
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.000]   the both guys in their prime.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.840]   I tend to lean towards Fedor
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.560]   because my heart was with Fedor,
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.920]   but he could have gone the other way.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   But just because Miocic lose his last fight,
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.240]   now everybody is like, "Oh yeah."
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.800]   They forgot about him.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.280]   It's crazy, man.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.440]   It's one fight.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.360]   You zig when you should zag, boom.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.680]   That's the reality of mixed martial art.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.240]   - Well, that's why the thing is,
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.720]   the mixed martial arts isn't just the performance,
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.400]   the strictly who won and who lost.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.360]   It's also the stories we tell ourselves.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.200]   And so, I mean, there's beautiful stories being weaved.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.360]   And that also is part of who is the greatest of all time
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.000]   is what were the battles?
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.640]   What had to be overcome?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.640]   What was the flavor of the flawless performances?
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.880]   All of that plays into it.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.600]   And you're right, being able to walk away at the top
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.360]   is also part of that.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:45.040]   - A lot of people ask me about Khabib.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.960]   And that fight, I wanted to happen.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.320]   Khabib wanted to happen,
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.680]   but UFC did not want to happen.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.720]   - Between you and Khabib.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.560]   - Yes.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.280]   And we tried to make it like about three years ago
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.720]   when I retired.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.280]   No, it was after two years ago.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.880]   And it never came to fruition.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.000]   The UFC were clear.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.440]   They said they have other plan for Khabib.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.160]   And it makes sense for the business standpoint
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.320]   because they want to keep the ball rolling.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.600]   Now Khabib retired.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.040]   And like everybody else, after Justin Gaethje,
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.000]   I was doing the commentator in French for the UFC.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.160]   And I had Butterfly.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.760]   I thought he was going to call me out.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.840]   (laughing)
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.960]   If there is one guy that I would have said yes,
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.920]   it would be him because for a fighter,
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.800]   the most exciting things to do,
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.000]   it's often the scariest one.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.360]   And Khabib was worth-
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.400]   - He's the scariest matchup?
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.800]   - Yes, but he was worth the risk
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.560]   because nobody have ever been able to solve them.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.160]   - How would you solve the Khabib,
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.640]   no matter how many of them out of puzzle?
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.000]   - Well, Khabib is very good against the fence.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.640]   I would have to establish a game plan and everything.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.960]   But I think what I would need it to do
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.520]   is take the center of the octagon right away.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.840]   Use a lot of think and faith.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.960]   Keep the fight all the way out or all the way in.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.000]   And when I say all the way in,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.320]   is when you close the gap,
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.680]   use my proactive and reactive takedown
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.360]   and perhaps my superior explosivity to put him down.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.960]   I like to use those proactive and reactive takedown
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.320]   because for me, I feel it's more economical.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   Khabib is a much better chain wrestler than me.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.440]   Chain wrestler is when you got the guys to the fence,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.000]   it's pure wrestling.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.840]   What makes my takedown very efficient,
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.160]   it's my karate, it's not my wrestling.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.240]   I'm very good at timing my opponent
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.800]   and getting in with my explosivity.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.400]   So if you watch at my takedown,
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.840]   it does not demand a lot of work.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.960]   I call it proactive takedown.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.320]   When he's coming to punch me and I react.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.200]   So I mean, proactive is when I'm faking it.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.280]   So I instigate the takedown by a fake,
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.640]   then I take him down.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.200]   And reactive is when I'm baiting him to throw something,
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.640]   then I'm going. - As a counter.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.800]   Yeah, yeah. - Yes.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.120]   But all my takedowns- - In the center of the octagon.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   - Yes, my takedowns are more in the center of the octagon.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   Like for example, another guy that does it well
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.600]   is Gleason Thibaud, that did it well in his best days.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.760]   Khabib has more a style of chain wrestling,
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.360]   I would say like Kamaru Usman, so to speak, kind of guy.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.640]   It's a different style.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.320]   You cannot compare both styles.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.280]   And that's the kind of takedown I'm good.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.360]   And if I would have fight Khabib,
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.520]   that's one of the strategy I would have adopted.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.840]   I wouldn't have been afraid
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.120]   because everybody that I fought,
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.760]   I was able to put them down.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   And I have the pedigree to prove it in my fight resume.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.800]   So you would have perhaps seen my back
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.040]   and I would have perhaps be in my back as well.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.320]   So it would have been a very interesting fight.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.280]   - How hard do you think he is to take down?
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.400]   I mean, a lot of people speak about his wrestling being-
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.600]   - It has nothing to do with the wrestling because-
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.440]   - That's due to the karate.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.840]   - If I got the timing and I got my both hand
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.080]   around his knees, he's going down the other way.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.360]   - Everybody goes down, yeah.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.040]   - Yes, yes, he goes down.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.280]   And I had a lot of that.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.520]   That's what I would have adopted.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.840]   I would not have been afraid of his wrestling.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.960]   I would have be the instigator.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.880]   I would have forced the fight forward.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.760]   And that's how I would have approached that fight,
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.880]   which I believe most of his opponent
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.240]   were afraid of his wrestling
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.560]   because they didn't have the tools
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.080]   that I have to put him down.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.760]   I would not have forced the wrestling.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.280]   I would have, in the clinch,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.760]   I would have tried to disengage.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.720]   I have many ways to disengage the clinch.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.480]   I would have wanted to force the fight
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.280]   in a fighting distance,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.720]   you know, like in a shoot box distance,
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.320]   not in a wrestling distance.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.840]   - Is it possible this fight still happens?
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.240]   You're young, look great in the suit.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:10.200]   - Well, there's a lot of problems now.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.480]   And the thing is, now I made peace with it.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.720]   I no longer don't want to fight.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.080]   And I don't, it's not going to happen.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.440]   UFC was not interested.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.000]   And I'm bound by contract with the UFC and by exclusivity.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.440]   There's some people says to me,
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.960]   "Oh, how about if Russians,
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.960]   a crazy wealthy Russian guy come with the money?"
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.880]   I said, "I'm going to be in court with UFC."
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.560]   And also I'm older now.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.520]   And when I go home, man, I'm like,
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.040]   I don't want to do this, you know?
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.720]   - But you were always like this.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.600]   - No, but I don't want to do this.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.360]   But like, for example, I was training with Freddie Roach.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.840]   A few days ago and I'm hitting pads, you know?
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.160]   (imitates punching)
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.680]   And Freddie's looking at me and he's like,
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.280]   "Hey, you have the hitch back."
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.240]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.680]   If Dana White would walk in the room, in the gym,
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.800]   at that precise moment with a UFC contract,
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.880]   I would sign it in the blink of an eye.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.360]   But then after I go home, I'm like, "Hell no."
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.760]   My belly is full, I'm healthy, I'm wealthy.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.720]   Why would I want to fight for?
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.960]   I made peace with it.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.800]   But the minute I go back in the gym,
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.360]   because I still get it inside me,
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.080]   when I train with the young guys, I still get it.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.200]   And a lot of guys think, say,
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.280]   "Tell me the truth, you're preparing a comeback."
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.120]   'Cause I still get it.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.000]   You know, I'm a little bit older, but I got more knowledge.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.160]   I can compensate.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.560]   I become a different animal because it changed you.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.360]   But then after you go home and you're like,
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.400]   "Man, no way I'm doing this."
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.920]   (both laugh)
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.280]   It's very hard to explain.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.000]   You need to be a fighter to understand that.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.280]   It's very, very hard to explain.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.360]   - Well, from your perspective, I think,
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.640]   Khabib is one of the rare,
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.400]   one of the few fascinating scientific puzzles
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.520]   yet to be solved.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.200]   So from that aspect, as a martial artist,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.760]   it's just a fascinating journey
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.160]   to try to solve that puzzle.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.040]   - There is a thing too, like we say,
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.320]   "Oh, who's the best fighter?"
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.320]   People, like I realized that later in my life.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.720]   And I'm sure a lot of young guy will say,
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.160]   "Oh, St-Pierre, don't speak for me."
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.920]   But I'm telling you right now,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.240]   what I'm about to say, you will realize it later.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.480]   When I was young, I think you can proclaim yourself
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.480]   the baddest man on the planet.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.040]   You know, like nobody can beat you at.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.520]   It's an illusion, man.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.000]   - That's the sad thing about, for example, DC.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.720]   Daniel Kormien is probably one of the greatest,
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.360]   if not the greatest of all time.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.600]   You said Neochish, but like,
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.800]   it's almost because of that little matchup with Jon Jones,
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.960]   it's difficult for people to conceive of him
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.320]   as the greatest of all time.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.640]   - It's all about matchup.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.040]   It's all about timing.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.640]   And also you make a fight,
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.760]   you make both guys fight 10 times.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.480]   The result might be different.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.480]   Like every time, you know, I mean,
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.240]   maybe he's gonna win eight out of 10,
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.760]   but that night he's gonna lose.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.600]   Why?
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.880]   Because we don't know the universe made it like that.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.920]   You know, maybe he got sick,
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.000]   maybe he had the emotional issues,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:23.920]   he didn't sleep well,
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.120]   and he makes him lose focus and he got caught.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.800]   We don't know, but that's the thing.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.040]   People ask me, would you have done it with Khabib?
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.880]   What would happen?
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.040]   I don't know, maybe out of 10 times, I don't know.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.960]   Maybe as a fighter, I hope I would have win more than him.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.760]   He thinks the opposite.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.920]   It's only one way to find out,
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.200]   but that night, if there is a fight,
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.200]   the guy that gonna win doesn't mean he's the best fighter.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.360]   That's mean he's the one that fought the best
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.200]   the night of the fight.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.680]   Same thing in basketball or hockey.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.560]   The team that wins the game,
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.240]   it's not necessarily the best team.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:04.800]   It's the team that play the best the night of the game.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.520]   And fighting is no different.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.240]   So being the baddest man on the planet, it's an illusion.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.640]   - I mean, that's the tragic thing about it
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.880]   is on any one night, anything can happen.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.560]   And then that tells a story for all of human history.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:23.680]   It's sad to think about,
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.960]   but that's what makes it beautiful
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.200]   that there's so much at stake, like entire lives,
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.960]   all the dreams you've had growing up, all the hard work,
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.320]   all of it is decided in a single night,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.640]   even though that means nothing
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.400]   in terms of who's actually better.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.520]   I mean, that's the beauty.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520]   That's why people love the Olympics especially
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.000]   'cause it happens so rarely and dreams are broken
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   or like triumph is achieved by the unlikely hero
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.920]   all like right there.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.600]   I mean, that's why we love it, right?
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.640]   That's why we love it.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.800]   - If we would know always the result
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.200]   before it would be boring, that's why we do it.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:08.920]   You watch the odds, like sometimes I like to watch the odds
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.920]   before a fight because there's things,
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.920]   I believe in causality.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.000]   I believe in everybody believe different things,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.080]   but I believe everything is because
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.560]   there's a cause to everything.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.440]   That's personally what I believe.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.880]   I don't believe that I have like free will.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.440]   I think I have the illusion of free will,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.200]   but I believe there is a cause for everything.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.000]   And if I'm doing something because of something,
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.560]   because of a cause by definition,
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.240]   there's no free will in a way.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.840]   If there's a cause by definition, there is not.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.240]   - How does that make you feel by the way?
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.680]   Like the idea that if we just look outside
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.440]   even just human psychology and fighting and so on,
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.160]   if we look at like physics, if everything's predetermined,
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.960]   if all of these little molecules interacting,
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.360]   it's all already like your story is already written.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:04.160]   - I mean, it's written, but I would need to know
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.480]   all the data and it's impossible, right?
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.480]   Like it's kind of weird, I gotta say, but I don't,
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.800]   to me, I don't see any argument to counter that idea.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:22.640]   Maybe I'm ignorant, but I haven't seen nobody
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.200]   and everything that I've read so far,
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.720]   there is nothing that counter that idea that,
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.280]   because in a mechanical world, if your car broke,
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.120]   or we don't say, oh, the car decided to broke,
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.840]   or a tree is fall, there's reason why the tree is fall,
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.360]   if we don't say the tree is decide to fall, right?
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.520]   So because us human being, I think it's our ego,
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.680]   we decide, and I'm no different than anybody,
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.400]   when I make a decision, I decided to do this,
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:57.400]   I choose to do this, but I'm aware that there is causes
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:03.160]   that make me do certain things.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.840]   And by definition, I think if there is a cause,
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.480]   there is no free will, by definition, right?
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.880]   - Yes, but the thing is, just like you said,
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.040]   we understand so little about human intelligence,
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.960]   the human mind, and especially consciousness,
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:22.960]   that this giant mystery, this darkness,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.680]   that we don't understand how it feels like to be something,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.640]   to be a conscious being, that because of that,
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.160]   we're not able to really even reason about free will or not.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.560]   'Cause there might be some magic
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.000]   that comes from consciousness.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.960]   The consciousness might be the thing that makes us different
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.820]   from a car that breaks down.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:54.080]   There might be something totally fascinating,
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.640]   totally undiscovered yet, that will make us realize
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.360]   that free will is actually real,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.120]   and is somehow fundamental to the human experience.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.640]   So, sometimes I think we forget,
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.360]   when we talk about free will and physics,
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.520]   and it all seeming to be predetermined,
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:18.220]   we forget how little we actually understand about the world.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.600]   And I think in that mystery,
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.920]   that could be totally new ideas
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.280]   that are yet to be discovered,
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:28.720]   and will make us realize that it's not just an illusion.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.520]   It is something that is at the core
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.520]   of how the universe works.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.920]   Some people believe that consciousness
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.640]   is a fundamental property of the universe.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.320]   Like it's one of the forces of physics.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.360]   Consciousness permeates everything, in everything.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.840]   Like this table is conscious,
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.560]   but it's not as conscious as us,
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.960]   and we're this little peak of consciousness.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.120]   And if that's true, and if we get to understand that,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.720]   maybe there's something,
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.600]   there's an extra bonus we get in terms of free will,
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.200]   once you become one of those entities
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.760]   that are super conscious.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.720]   So, I tend to be sort of humbled by the mystery of it.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.520]   - Do you believe one day,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.240]   with the technology that keep improving,
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:22.240]   we will make robot that will be able to
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.040]   be somehow conscious?
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.160]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.560]   That's been my dream.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.520]   That's been, I hope to do just that.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.680]   First of all, I believe that all people are capable
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.440]   and want to be good to each other.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.440]   And I think love is a really powerful thing
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.280]   that connects us and can create better and better worlds.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.800]   Sort of like create better and better societies
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.360]   that improve both the technology, the quality of life,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.840]   and just the basics of human experience.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.320]   And I think creating AI systems that are conscious,
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.800]   that are human-like,
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.240]   can enable us to be better to each other.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.440]   Like they can, it's almost like adding more and more
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.600]   kindness to the world through the systems we interact with
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.440]   will inspire us to be better and better to each other.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.620]   In terms of them being conscious,
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:22.580]   I think that is an absolute requirement
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:25.380]   that entities we interact with
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:29.740]   communicate some element of consciousness to us.
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.540]   Like that's how we connect to each other.
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.060]   The reason you and I connect
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.620]   is that we believe that each of us are conscious.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.520]   And to me, what consciousness means
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.560]   is the ability to hurt, ability to suffer,
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.320]   to struggle in this world.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.760]   Because just like you said,
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.620]   without the struggle, you don't have the love,
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.100]   you don't have the pleasure.
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.500]   And ultimately consciousness is an entity's ability
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.980]   to struggle, to suffer.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.700]   And from that arises the pleasure.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:08.700]   And us together being able to appreciate
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:13.900]   sort of appreciate the highs
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:17.140]   and experience together the lows.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.440]   That's how we form the deep connections.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.620]   I personally think we can create that in robots.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.940]   And I personally believe it's a lot easier than we think.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.740]   - Does it make you afraid sometimes
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.660]   about the fact that one day, hey, hi,
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:37.660]   like artificial intelligence could hurt us?
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.940]   Or, you know, like, because of Hollywood, of course,
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.080]   you know, the movies we watch,
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.900]   but it seems like when I hear sometimes Elon Musk talking,
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.180]   you know, like.
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.420]   - Yeah, so Elon talks about with AI,
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.300]   we're summoning the demon.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.420]   He is very concerned.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.580]   And I talked to him about it quite a bit.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.780]   He's very concerned about all the different ways
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.680]   AI could hurt us humans.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.780]   I tend to believe that there's a lot more ways
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:08.500]   in which AI can make our lives better
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.180]   and can make life awesome for humans.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:16.180]   I think humans are the ones that can do a lot of evil things.
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.140]   So I'm less worried about AI, I'm more worried about humans.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.940]   If I look at what human have done on the course of history,
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.740]   you know, for example,
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:32.460]   in regards to the planet, to the scale of the universe,
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:36.060]   I think what I'm afraid is that we have more
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.980]   of a destructive force than a beneficial force.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.220]   So if AI take that in consideration
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:48.620]   in order to protect us against ourself,
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.540]   it could hurt us.
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.140]   I don't know if you understand what,
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:54.300]   like, what do you think about that?
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.900]   Does it makes you afraid sometime?
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:00.900]   Not because of AI, but because of what humans are doing
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:04.180]   that AI could do to us to prevent us
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.980]   of hurting ourself, you know?
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:09.260]   - Yeah, no, I mean, definitely it can bring out
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:11.220]   the worst in human nature
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:16.180]   and provide tools for evil people
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:19.100]   to do evil things at a larger scale.
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:20.440]   But I just think,
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.300]   it depends what you think human beings are.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.960]   I tend to believe that as we get more intelligent,
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:35.140]   we start to see the value, the evolutionary value,
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.620]   and the value in terms of happiness
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:37.940]   of being good to each other.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.300]   And I think AI, if you look at AI
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:41.820]   as an optimization problem
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:44.100]   of how to create a civilization that works well
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.060]   and expands throughout the universe,
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.020]   I think love is much more effective.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.420]   So AI will help us maximize that.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.420]   I think there's going to be always spikes throughout
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.420]   as it has been through human history
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.780]   where charismatic leaders will do evil
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.940]   onto the world in the name of good.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.100]   You have the Stalin and the Hitlers and all of that.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:11.660]   But ultimately, over time,
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.660]   I think technology will give the good people power
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:21.900]   and the evil people less power.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.860]   Now, there's a lot of ways in that,
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:26.820]   that that won't be the case.
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.420]   There's a lot of ways for it to go wrong.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:29.620]   And Elon talks about them,
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:34.620]   but I honestly think in terms of intelligent AI,
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.500]   that's going to bring more love to the world.
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.780]   The thing I'm concerned about is dumb AI.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:43.260]   So there's been a lot of discussion
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.080]   between China and the United States recently
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.300]   on autonomous weapons system.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.140]   This is something people don't,
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:50.620]   they're afraid to talk about.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.020]   But there's now a race
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:58.500]   where the United States has officially said
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:03.340]   that they're not against adding AI to its weapon systems.
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:08.340]   So now the US military is adding automation,
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.060]   adding intelligence to its drones,
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:15.900]   to its anything that can create damage.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.140]   And so of course,
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:21.140]   and they did this so in response to China doing that.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.540]   So you can imagine this is Terminator.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.480]   You think about Terminator as intelligent systems,
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.620]   they're not, they're pretty dumb.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:34.180]   The point is they're efficient at doing what they do.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.380]   And in the space of war,
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.540]   efficient at doing what you do means killing.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.980]   So that I'm really afraid of, but those are dumb AI.
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:47.980]   Those aren't your loving, deep, fulfilling relationships.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:53.340]   That's like efficiently being able to fly,
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.980]   to plan the trajectory of dropping bombs, of missiles,
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.080]   of how to do counter attacks,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.260]   of how to maximize the destruction of a particular facility
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.900]   instead of individuals.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.360]   And then that can just escalate.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.660]   And as opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union,
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.380]   this could be a hot war.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:17.380]   And then the consequences, once you allow,
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.260]   it's kind of terrifying.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:21.940]   'Cause currently the drones are operated by humans.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.940]   So you have, say you have information,
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.860]   about intelligence gives you information
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:32.980]   about a particular terrorist located in this area.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:36.700]   And then you use drones to maybe,
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:39.780]   the automation there is to help you figure out
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:44.220]   what is the best trajectory to strike at that location.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:48.500]   So you still have a human that pulls the trigger at the end,
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.740]   dropping the bomb.
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:54.220]   Now, automation and AI and autonomous weapons systems
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:58.620]   might be where you say, there's a bad guy over here.
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:02.300]   You figure out how to get rid of the bad guy.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:04.780]   So then of course the systems will be very good
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.580]   at finding the right trajectory and so on.
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:12.580]   But there's bugs that can happen, unexpected bugs,
[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:15.420]   that the system might figure out that there is,
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:20.040]   this bad guy might actually be in these other five locations.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.620]   So it might make sense to cover the entire area, right?
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.540]   And so you might drop bombs on the entire area.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:32.020]   And then, that's just, okay, so that's going to lead
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.160]   to a lot of destruction at the scale of a city.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.540]   But then you can immediately take that to nuclear weapons.
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:41.400]   If you add automation to responding to counter attacks
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.660]   to nuclear weapons, you might get information
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.260]   that somebody's planning a nuclear attack
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.300]   on the United States.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.380]   And the AI system will immediately respond.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.720]   And it can respond to the scale
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.760]   of launching nuclear weapons itself.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.160]   And so there's all of these possibilities
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.240]   that don't require much intelligence.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:04.240]   And that's exceptionally concerning.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:08.100]   - I'm like you, I do not believe there is babies
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:09.240]   that are born bad.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   I think people do bad things because of their experience.
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.720]   However, if I look through my experience
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.840]   and from what I can see, very often,
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.840]   men of power wants more power.
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:31.540]   That's what makes me afraid with-
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.760]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.400]   I, listen, I've been, I've come from the Soviet Union.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.780]   Stalin is arguably one of the most powerful humans
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.120]   in history.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.040]   He's not talked often enough about by the evils he's done.
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.800]   Hitler gets all the attention,
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:50.080]   but Stalin has done arguably much more evil than Hitler.
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.200]   Yeah, well, this is human nature.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.820]   It wants power.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.160]   We see that with institutions.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.360]   We see that with governments and nations.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.000]   I think you see this with the internet.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.800]   People are really hungry for the distribution of power.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.400]   Like you see that people are very much distrustful
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.660]   of centralized places of power, of institutions and so on.
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.960]   So I think successful organizations, successful companies,
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.360]   successful governments will be run by people
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.000]   who distribute the power.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.720]   Like I don't trust myself with power at all.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.520]   And I think you have to build into the system
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.780]   that no one person can have power, that you distribute it.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.040]   That's where you have, in the financial sector,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.120]   you have cryptocurrency right now with Bitcoin
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.360]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.000]   People are exploring,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.360]   how can we avoid the central bank to have the control?
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.120]   How do you put the power in the hands of people,
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.160]   thousands of people, millions of people?
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:52.420]   And in the same way with military,
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:57.420]   with any kind of, with technology,
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.860]   I think the future looks very distributed.
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:03.600]   - What do you think about militarizing space?
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.560]   - The Space Force.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.880]   I don't think about it often
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.440]   because right now I'm filled with excitement
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.680]   about space exploration, which is the positive aspect.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.680]   So Elon, I was born in an era where it was exciting.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.900]   I don't know about you,
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.720]   but for me it's exciting to look up to the stars
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.720]   and dream about us humans colonizing Mars,
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.720]   colonizing other planets,
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.320]   expanding out to the galaxy, into the universe.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.480]   That's really exciting.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:43.040]   So the possibilities there are endless.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:47.440]   I don't think, because also the resources are endless.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.120]   And so I think we get into trouble with militarization,
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.920]   with wars, when the resources are very constrained.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.520]   So I think for a while we're not going to be fighting.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.160]   The only wars we'll be fighting in space
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.200]   are the ones that kind of help us.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.240]   - Another nation to compete.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.000]   Who goes to the moon first, I guess.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.120]   - That's those kinds of things.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.600]   Or maybe for satellites
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.200]   and all of those kinds of communication
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:17.840]   and maybe in assistance for like cyber warfare,
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.040]   which is also very dangerous.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.840]   But in terms of the wars out in space,
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.280]   I think everything out in space
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.880]   will be positive and inspiring.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.320]   It's very hard, but all good things are hard, I think.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.600]   This is where I've been talking to a bunch of people
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.880]   about extraterrestrial life.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.880]   I'm really excited by, I don't know, it's the other thing.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:48.240]   When I look out to the stars, it's exciting to me.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.520]   I know I think you've spoken about it being scary,
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.880]   but to me it's exciting
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.280]   that there's intelligent creatures out there
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.560]   far beyond perhaps the intelligence of our own
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.440]   that are just too far away to explore yet,
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.680]   but we might one day come in contact with them.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.920]   So that to me is the ultimate motivator,
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.680]   is to meet other intelligence life forms out there
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:12.920]   and connect with them.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.040]   - Have you ever meet Jacques Vallée?
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.640]   - No, but I've been in communication.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.240]   I hope to talk to him.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.080]   He's amazing.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:20.920]   - He's French, yeah.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.160]   I know that there's many theories about,
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.520]   you know, if they're resilient, we don't know, right?
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.800]   But some people think it's from another star systems.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.120]   Jacques Vallée has a, like to make a long story short,
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.400]   he has a different theory.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.520]   He thinks it's perhaps beings that
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:45.000]   could be living in a different dimension than us.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.960]   And the reason why he says that is
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.680]   when he makes an experiment,
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.240]   when there is a sightings very often of a UFO,
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.960]   let's say I'm the UFO, you have three guys.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:00.160]   One, they are looking at the UFO.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.120]   Very often, one experiment that you can do,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120]   and sometime that is the case,
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.280]   you ask your two friends to walk on the side
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.920]   and there's a point that it's like a corridor.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.520]   You see the UFO and then you stop seeing it like a corridor.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.960]   And that's one of the reason why he's saying that
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:19.840]   it's perhaps dimension.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.920]   And I found that fascinating, you know?
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.280]   - This is what, you know,
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.880]   to the discussion of consciousness and all that,
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.000]   it feels like we might be just experiencing
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.760]   a very particular slice of this universe.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.680]   We might not be understanding what's at the higher dimensions
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:37.160]   or yeah, I mean, higher dimensions
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.680]   in whatever form that means.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.200]   You know, there's all these physical theories now
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.120]   that describe a world with dimensions
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.920]   that's much higher than the four dimensions
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.480]   of the three dimensional space
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.640]   and the one dimension of time.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.240]   So whatever the hell is going on in those other dimensions,
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.600]   it could be something.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.920]   Unfortunately, this is the sad part.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.080]   It might be something we can't even comprehend
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.960]   with our human brains.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.040]   That the limitations are just,
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.240]   I mean, we're just descendants of apes.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.720]   So like, it might not be possible to even understand.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   - Is there alien?
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.880]   Is there another dimension?
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.600]   Are they human from the future?
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.920]   Is there perhaps Chinese or another,
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:18.760]   you know what I mean?
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:19.840]   A group of people that are working
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.800]   with a technology far behind.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:24.200]   But you know what, Lex, I had the chance to meet,
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.880]   you know, because of the sport I'm doing,
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.080]   I met a lot of people in military and politics sometimes
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.200]   that I ask them every time.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.360]   I met one this week and I asked him,
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.120]   I say, "Is it true about the UFO is there?"
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.440]   And he says to me, he's like,
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.920]   even before I asked him, I say,
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.440]   "Hey, sorry, I have to ask you a question."
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.920]   I was in Los Angeles.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.960]   And I said, "Sorry, I have to ask you a question."
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.520]   He said, "Oh, you want to ask me about UFO?"
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.360]   Right away, he knew it.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.440]   And I say, "Yes."
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.480]   - He saw it in your eyes.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.360]   - He said, "Yeah, there is things that flies
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.320]   that we don't know."
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.080]   But he didn't tell me, he doesn't know it.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.280]   They don't know if it's cellular or whatever,
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.160]   but there's things apparently that are detected.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.120]   And I know you met Fravor, you know, like-
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.200]   - Fravor is fascinating.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.120]   - It's crazy.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.880]   - It makes me sad that-
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.080]   - We live in a different era now that it's,
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.960]   it used to be a subject that was ridiculed
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.720]   and now it's so cool that it's, you know,
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.560]   I'm very excited to live in to that era, you know?
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.520]   - Yeah, it's really exciting,
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:29.440]   but still the governments are kind of behind the times
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.800]   on that aspect is they're not transparent
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.000]   and they don't communicate well.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.280]   You know, it saddens me to think the possibility
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.320]   that, you know, like the US government might be
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.280]   in possession of something that they don't tell the world
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.960]   about because they're just scared.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.320]   It's because they don't know what the hell it is
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.680]   and they don't want the Chinese to gain the technology
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.440]   or all those kinds of things.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.000]   - Do you think the president of the United States,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.640]   for example, because the president comes and go every,
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.960]   right, four or eight years,
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.080]   do you think he would know all the secret
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.720]   or it would be a guy like, for example,
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.680]   Vladimir Putin would know much of, you know what I mean?
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.520]   I don't think the president even know,
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.720]   like even knows all the secrets, right?
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.720]   - The US president, yeah.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.120]   - I don't think so because he goes,
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.520]   they go back and forth, you know, every four years,
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.760]   you know, they have the terms, right?
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.080]   So I, you know, I wasn't sure before,
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.880]   but I think I could trust the previous United States
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.040]   president of Donald Trump that if he knew,
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.440]   he would probably tweet about it.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.440]   So I think from the, you know, I've worked with DARPA,
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.720]   I worked with DOD at a clearance.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.480]   And I think from the perspective,
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.720]   if you see the world as fundamentally a dangerous world,
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.440]   where secrets are important to have
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.840]   from a military perspective,
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.080]   I think it's very unsafe to tell the president
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.840]   of the United States that you have this kind of technology.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.440]   So if you think of the world in that way,
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:11.160]   I hate that that's how that world is viewed
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.840]   because ultimately I think what's more powerful
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.440]   than the military secrets,
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.240]   and I hope that actually is what will happen
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.920]   in the 21st century,
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.080]   what's more powerful is inspire people,
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.040]   inspire the young Elon Musk's of the world
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.040]   to create cool new things.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.480]   If we have technology that we've have come,
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.840]   have encountered that we don't understand,
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:38.000]   that should only be inspiration
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.640]   to develop that kind of stuff.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.360]   It shouldn't be seen as military,
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.760]   as a military threat, as a secret to hold onto.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.000]   - I think secrets,
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.840]   I hope we more and more let go of the idea
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.400]   that there are secrets that give us advantage.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.560]   You know, like in the tech sector,
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.800]   people are more and more releasing the software,
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.120]   they're making it open source.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.280]   Like secrets don't make sense.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.160]   - They share the knowledge, right?
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.480]   - Share the knowledge, like being afraid
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:13.120]   to share the knowledge, I think, I hope is an old idea.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.720]   - It's more, yeah, when you make it,
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.720]   things more compartmentalize, you know?
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.320]   - Yes, well, yeah, that's the other thing
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.400]   is the bureaucracy of government is like,
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.320]   people only know their own little thing
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.800]   and they don't spread the information,
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.080]   it doesn't travel well.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.640]   I mean, there's a lot of just inefficiencies there.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.200]   It makes me sad, it makes me sad
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.520]   'cause the science, the engineering
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.200]   that happens in governments, like Lockheed Martin,
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.640]   developing the different airplanes
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.360]   that they use for military applications,
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.880]   that's some of the most incredible engineering ever.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.360]   And it's secret because they're afraid to share it
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.260]   with the Russians and the Chinese and so on.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:55.320]   But on that topic, I do think somebody like Vladimir Putin-
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.160]   - Would know?
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.200]   - Probably knows some stuff.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.240]   - My God, my God.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.860]   - I would love to know what he knows.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:05.520]   But then again, you never know because even he is,
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.620]   people think of him as an exceptionally powerful person,
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.240]   but he's also just managing a bunch of tribes.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.000]   His power is very limited.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.800]   He's trying to hold together a bunch of greedy,
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.400]   power hungry madmen.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.240]   - That's right.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.480]   - Okay, and he's trying to establish a balance.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.960]   He might not know everything.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.720]   So I hope this changes
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.840]   'cause I think there's nothing more exciting about-
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:35.400]   - I don't even know if there is a human that knows,
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.240]   you know what I mean?
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.920]   Like this idea that there's some alien civilization
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.680]   that land on the White House and say,
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.160]   "Hi, I come to meet the president."
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.320]   And I, why would they do that?
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.920]   You know what I mean?
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.480]   It's kind of absurd.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.800]   - Well, I do think that actually,
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.240]   I mean, that's one possibility, right?
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:55.380]   Is LART, you know,
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:59.480]   if an alien civilization really wanted to contact us,
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.400]   I think everybody would know.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.200]   So I think what we're,
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.200]   if there's any kind of interaction between humans and aliens,
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.840]   I think most likely what we're interacting with
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.220]   is a crappy like probe drone thing
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.400]   that kind of just like,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.240]   like it's like this-
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.080]   - Wah, wah.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:19.520]   - Yeah, more, yeah.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.480]   It's this dumb thing, you know,
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.960]   we're not interacting with the aliens.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.720]   I think just like for us,
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.480]   I think humans aren't,
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.000]   when we venture out into space,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.260]   the first thing that's going to meet aliens is our robots.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.700]   It's not us humans.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.720]   'Cause we keep sending robots out.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.600]   So they're going to like,
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.960]   they're going to make decisions about humans
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.240]   by looking at the robots.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:45.160]   (laughs)
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.440]   - I say the famous grays.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:48.260]   - The grays.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:49.700]   - Maybe they are robots.
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.280]   Maybe it's all BS too, you know?
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.960]   So I don't know,
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.400]   I don't know what that interaction actually would look like
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:00.080]   if aliens really wanted to reach out, really communicate.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.160]   And I don't know if we're able
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.520]   to actually communicate with them.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.800]   That's one of the sad things.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.040]   We might not be able to,
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.080]   we might, the aliens might already be here
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.880]   and we might just not even know how to see them
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.840]   or know how to communicate with them.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.000]   - There's so much misinformation
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.480]   and sometimes there is people that are very credible
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.120]   that made crazy claims, you know?
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.000]   Like you don't know what to believe, you know?
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.360]   Like Paul Elyard,
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:35.840]   the minister of defense of Canada said like some,
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.720]   that there is many alien rays that ever,
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.600]   that's what he said, research it.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:44.640]   And that scientist from, I think Israel recently
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.600]   have said something about Trump.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:50.320]   He was keeping secret or Medvedev, you're from Russia.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.000]   Medvedev have been caught in a,
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.600]   like during a break in between interviews
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.760]   to talks about like, oh, it's like men in black,
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:57.600]   so to speak.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.440]   I don't know, he didn't look like he was joking,
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.120]   but I don't know if he was saying the truth.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:01.960]   - I didn't know about this.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.800]   That's interesting.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.620]   - Yeah, you can check on YouTube.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:05.980]   It's, it went viral.
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:07.740]   Yeah, there's a lot of things like that sometime.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:11.420]   I'm like, or Bob Lazar, I'm like,
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:13.500]   imagine if it's true, man.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.540]   - Yeah.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:17.300]   - Imagine if we're like a fish in the water,
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.060]   we live in our own world
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:22.740]   and sometime there's a fisherman that grabbed the fish,
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:25.660]   take him out of the water and threw it back in the water
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:27.020]   and the fish goes back to the other fish,
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.700]   it's like, hey, there's someone
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.020]   that take me out of the water.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:33.260]   Then I've seen things that I did not like,
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.740]   imagine if it's true.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:39.260]   Like, and one other thing, like,
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.300]   I wanted to ask you because you were consciousness,
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:43.380]   how about dreams?
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.620]   What is a dream?
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.620]   - Yeah, well, I more and more,
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.220]   I don't know if you're paying attention to this.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:50.460]   There's now, it's become more acceptable
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.620]   in the scientific community
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:54.260]   to do large scale studies of psychedelics, for example.
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.380]   And there's a lot of connection
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.700]   between psychedelics and dreams.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:58.980]   There's very similar states.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.620]   There's a lot our mind does
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.820]   when it detaches itself from reality,
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.260]   that it can just explore a lot of different ideas.
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:09.380]   It's very possible that dreams is you're traveling somewhere
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.780]   and the same thing with psychedelics,
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.460]   you're traveling somewhere.
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:15.540]   In a different, not traveling to physical space,
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.540]   it's the other dimensions that we were talking about.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.700]   You're traveling some other,
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.220]   through some other dimension to meet some other creature.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.940]   People talk with DMT that they meet some elves.
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:27.220]   I've never done, I'd like to.
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:30.100]   I don't know if there's a safe, legal way to do it,
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:33.620]   but they all talk about meeting elves
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:36.900]   and creatures like entities.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.260]   And like, who are they?
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.940]   What's, what is this?
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.500]   - Is it because they're high or it's because-
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:45.860]   - They're actually meeting something
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.340]   and maybe there's no difference.
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:49.740]   I mean, that, who knows exactly.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.140]   And that's takes us right back to us
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:55.140]   not being able to really understand how our mind works.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.020]   You know, I work in artificial intelligence.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:01.620]   It's clear that we understand so little about intelligence,
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:04.300]   some basic things about intelligence.
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:09.300]   Just at the very sort of basic first principles level,
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:14.660]   we don't understand what it means to reason, to think,
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:18.580]   to assimilate pieces of knowledge together
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:21.660]   from the basics to the complex.
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.500]   We don't understand it.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.120]   We don't understand how the human mind does it.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:26.500]   We don't understand how the human mind
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:30.820]   is able to take incredible waterfall of information
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:34.340]   and filter cleanly into just like clean.
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.220]   You only see the things that are important
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:37.860]   and are able to stitch them together
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.140]   and be able to reason about the world.
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:43.420]   And at the same time have moments of like genius,
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:46.100]   of creativity, like what is that?
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:49.300]   That also, you know, people, writers talk about that,
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:50.420]   that they're, you know,
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:52.140]   they're almost like communicating with a muse.
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:53.660]   Like where do ideas come from?
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:54.500]   - Yeah.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:55.660]   - This is the Joe Rogan philosophy.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.180]   - But I do know that past civilization
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.700]   where a lot of them were based on shamanism.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:02.660]   And you know what?
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:07.660]   I think it's sad is if someone drink alcohol
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:12.580]   and when he's drunk, he's going to commit like murders
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.860]   or we're gonna blame the person, right?
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.260]   We're gonna say that's his fault.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.300]   It's not the fault of alcohol.
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.460]   However, if someone does psychedelic
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:24.340]   or any things that is illegal and do something crazy,
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:28.660]   now we're gonna put the fault on psychedelic.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:29.500]   You know what I mean?
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.500]   And perhaps the person itself is the reason why,
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.060]   you know, he's been doing these things.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.180]   You know what I mean?
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:40.940]   So yeah, it's fascinating how like society,
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:44.540]   you know, like in Canada, they just legalize marijuana.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.380]   - Oh yeah?
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.220]   - Yeah, marijuana is legal.
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.460]   But before that, before they did it,
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.260]   like if you talk, for example, to my dad,
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.460]   he's against it like because the whole mentality
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:56.820]   is like, it's drug, it's bad.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:59.500]   But drinking a glass, you know, drinking a beer, it's fine.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:02.460]   I mean, what is, you know what I mean?
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.460]   What is good?
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.300]   What is bad?
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:08.100]   And I guess eating chocolate could be bad as well
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:09.420]   for your health or like, I mean,
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:12.500]   I'm going to the extreme now, but what is good?
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.340]   What is bad?
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:15.140]   If you use it for recreation,
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:18.660]   you use it for an experience to learn about yourself.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:23.140]   It's like, it's the line is very tiny.
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:26.820]   You know, there's some countries that drugs are all legal,
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.660]   you know what I mean?
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:30.100]   And I don't know the stats,
[01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:31.980]   but I would be interesting to know
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:36.980]   if they have more crimes there than other countries
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.460]   where it's more strict.
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:41.180]   I would be interesting to know about that.
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:42.860]   It's fascinating, you know?
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:45.300]   - Yeah, and I mean, we humans kind of just come up
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.180]   with the arbitrary lines of what's good, what's bad,
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:51.500]   that applies with drugs, that applies with anything,
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.700]   that applies with animals, for example.
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:56.020]   We talked about carnivore diet.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.580]   Maybe the time we live in now will be remembered
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:02.660]   for the cruelty to animals, for example.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:07.660]   And I believe this, the 21st century will be remembered
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.080]   for our cruelties to robots.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:15.660]   That eventually there'll be a civil rights movement
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:19.860]   for robots, the ones who choose to be conscious,
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:22.420]   the ones who have consciousness will say,
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:24.020]   "We deserve rights too.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:27.700]   We deserve to be treated with respect too."
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:30.580]   - How about the people we put in jail?
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:31.980]   - People put in jail?
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.380]   - I think in the future we'll look back
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:37.660]   and we'll think of ourself being stupid
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.660]   to put people in jail instead of trying to fix the problem
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:46.340]   at the base.
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:49.220]   Of course now, I guess it's our ignorance
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:52.660]   that made it in a way that we cannot sometimes understand
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:55.580]   what makes sometimes a psychopath a psychopath
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:57.100]   or a murderer a murderer.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:01.520]   But if we can pinpoint the problem and take care of it
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.660]   before, you know what I mean?
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:07.860]   Or made it in a way that we can reestablish that person
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:12.580]   in the society, who knows what was the future is old.
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:15.740]   It's interesting, we're living in an interesting time.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:17.540]   - You mentioned your father.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:20.340]   What have you learned from your dad?
[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:22.620]   You mentioned he was an important part of your childhood.
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:25.180]   - My dad is amazing.
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.900]   I grew up, we didn't have a lot of money,
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:29.620]   but it doesn't mean if I'm born in a nice country
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.300]   that always nice thing happen.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:36.140]   My dad for me is a big role model
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:39.820]   because I see him through my life
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.820]   facing a lot of adversity.
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:45.580]   You know, he stopped drinking when I was a teenager.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:50.180]   He was an alcoholic and I seen him struggle through that.
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:52.300]   You know, and it was very, very hard.
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:57.300]   And I've seen him work like crazy hours,
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:04.020]   like come leave in the morning, come home at night,
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:08.980]   burned out because of work through almost all his life.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:13.980]   To the point that it became a slave of the system.
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:17.860]   It became an habit and a normal way of living.
[01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:21.500]   And it made me realize that I've learned a lot
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.260]   through my father.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:25.980]   He taught me perseverance, hard work.
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:28.020]   You know, when you face adversity,
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:30.420]   you know, to never give up until you achieve it.
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:34.820]   But also it taught me a lesson that,
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:38.380]   in a way that I don't want to be like him,
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:40.060]   even if he is happy,
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:44.420]   it's because I realized I don't think he knows anything else.
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:46.500]   Like he works through all his life
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:50.340]   and I don't want to live to work.
[01:52:50.340 --> 01:52:52.300]   I want to work for, you know what I mean?
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.780]   I want to decide when I work.
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:57.780]   You know, I feel like he lived to work
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:00.020]   instead of working for a living.
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:03.900]   And perhaps it's because he did not have choice.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:06.060]   He was the older of his family.
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:07.540]   They were nine kid.
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:10.180]   His dad, my grandfather died when he was young.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.100]   So he had to become the father of the family
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:16.420]   and work to put money on the table.
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:19.820]   So perhaps that's what made him that way.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:23.100]   And he became like, like an habit for him.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:27.060]   My dad taught me, when I was at school,
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:29.140]   I was bullied at school.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:32.100]   He's the first one who initiate me to martial art.
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:33.420]   He taught me karate.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:36.980]   My dad was a black belt in Kyokushin karate as well.
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.540]   But because he was working too much,
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:41.380]   he didn't have time to teach me.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:44.500]   And I needed self-defense in order to defend myself.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:48.940]   I have a winning, a great career in mixed martial art,
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.740]   but in the schoolyard.
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:52.460]   - That's so good.
[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:53.580]   Mixed record.
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:56.260]   - My record is not very good.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:02.700]   When you're a kid and you're about seven, eight years old,
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:06.620]   and you're facing bullies that are
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:12.140]   two to three years older than yourself,
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:14.340]   it's not the same thing than when you're 25
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.380]   and the guy is 28.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:19.420]   So there was a big discrepancy in terms of maturity.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:26.060]   So my dad taught me, introduced me to karate.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:28.980]   Then he didn't have time to teach me.
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:33.980]   Then he put me in a school with a teacher.
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:36.140]   It was Jean Couture.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:39.260]   And I grew up with a lot of anger.
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:45.100]   And there were two person that was afraid growing up.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.300]   It was my dad.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:49.140]   My dad was very severe, very strict with me.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:53.740]   And I'm glad he was because I could have become very bad.
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:56.980]   I could have become chosen on a different path.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:58.260]   People see me as a nice guy
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:00.020]   and I am a nice guy.
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.860]   I try to be a good role model,
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:06.380]   but I could easily have turned towards a wrong path.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.860]   - There's darkness somewhere in there.
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.220]   - Yes, there are a lot.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.460]   And a lot of my friends have choose that path.
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:16.460]   And unfortunately, they are not with me today.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.860]   Even if I'm from Canada
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:24.100]   and Canada seems like the nicest country in the world.
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:26.540]   Like I said, even if you live in a nice country,
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:27.500]   not always nice thing.
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.380]   It depends of the situation.
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:32.020]   But that's what my dad taught me.
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.140]   And he gave me that
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:40.580]   because I'm very good at learning by observing people.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:41.660]   And by observing him,
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:44.980]   I see the struggle he had with alcoholism
[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:48.260]   and what he did, the pain sometimes that he inflict
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:50.660]   to us, to my family.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:54.780]   But how he turn,
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:57.260]   he did that 180 degree.
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:59.380]   And I really admire that.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:02.740]   And I know it was very, very hard for him and he did it.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:07.140]   And for me, that's a great role model for me.
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:11.460]   - So with your dad being an engine of basically hard work
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.500]   and you finding a balance
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.660]   of being able to work your ass off,
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:18.980]   but also to be able to enjoy a piece of chocolate,
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:23.060]   what is a perfect day in the life of George St. Pierre
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:24.300]   look like?
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:27.340]   So like, if you were to go through a day
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:28.540]   that's very productive,
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:31.460]   but also one that makes you sit back and enjoy
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:33.300]   and say that was a good day,
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.740]   what's that look like?
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:35.900]   What are we talking about?
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:36.740]   When do you wake up?
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:37.620]   What do you eat?
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:39.380]   What do you do?
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:41.060]   - It changed over the years.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.940]   When I was younger, I have a good day.
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.620]   It was like a good training session
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:48.140]   or achieving good thing in my training.
[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:49.740]   And that's why I was very good at it
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.900]   because when I was obsessed,
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.660]   I think to be good at something,
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:56.260]   you need to become obsessed.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:57:00.500]   And to me, performing in my training was everything.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.980]   Like when I had a bad training session,
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:05.580]   I didn't tell my training partner,
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:08.300]   I was acting like because of my ego,
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:10.340]   I didn't tell nobody.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:11.260]   I was like, "Hey, hey, hey."
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:14.340]   Then I go in the locker room, I'm like, "Fuck, man."
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:19.340]   Then I'm playing the training in my mind,
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.420]   and I'm saying, "Okay, I should have done this,
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:22.260]   I should have done that."
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.580]   And it haunt me.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:24.980]   It haunt me, man.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:26.980]   It's a training and it haunt me
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.300]   until the next training session
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.700]   when I can redeem myself.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.500]   That's how it is.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:38.500]   When we used to train all together back in the day,
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:42.220]   in Canada, we had David Loiseau,
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:44.420]   we had Patrick Côté,
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:46.380]   we had Dennis Kang,
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:49.500]   Steve Vigneault, Jonathan Goulet.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.140]   It was all like the best guy in Canada
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.660]   that were training with each other.
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:56.340]   Before, we were training in different gyms,
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.620]   but once a week, I made it a note,
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:02.820]   I contact everybody that we all joined force
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:06.220]   and we exchange ideas and we train with each other.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:09.180]   So I would say friendly competition.
[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:13.060]   It was not malicious, but it was hard training.
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:16.860]   Our goal was to improve, but it wasn't very competitive.
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:21.700]   And when that day you used to get out of the training session
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:23.860]   with a bad performance, for me,
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:27.060]   it used to haunt me until the following week
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:30.300]   when I could give it back and perform better
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.060]   with the guy that I had the most trouble with.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:34.420]   That's how it was.
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:35.980]   And that's how you get better.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:38.860]   You know, but it was not a training
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:43.260]   where we were trying to do malicious thing to one another.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:44.940]   You know what I mean?
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:46.340]   It need to be playful,
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:49.260]   but playful, but competitive.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:50.540]   That when I had a good training session
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:53.100]   because a sparring was on a Friday,
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:54.420]   I had the best weekend in the world.
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.220]   I was going out with my friend, drinking and partying
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:58.060]   and have fun.
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:03.060]   That was my ideal day back in the day.
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:06.980]   Today has changed.
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:09.540]   You know, my life has changed.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:14.540]   You know, like I am not the same person I used to be
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:19.940]   when I went on my knees and begged the UFC for title shot.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:20.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:25.780]   I'm wealthy, I'm healthy, most importantly.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:27.980]   That's the most important thing.
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:31.420]   And as, man, I'm gonna tell you the truth,
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:36.060]   as good as my career was, man, my private life, man,
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:39.780]   is a million time better, man.
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:41.780]   I, and people ask me sometimes,
[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:45.180]   they always wonder, they try to ask me,
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:47.220]   and it's normal, a lot of people is curious
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:52.220]   and the reporter, and in the sport of mixed martial art,
[01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:56.940]   we say we play basketball, we play soccer,
[01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:58.780]   but you don't play fighting.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:01.180]   So when you expose your private life,
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.460]   we've seen that happen in the fight
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.620]   with sometimes Conor McGregor and Khabib.
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:09.540]   Your competitor knows that he cannot get to you,
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.380]   so what he will do,
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:12.700]   he will try to get to someone that you love.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:16.580]   So me, I never expose my private life.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:20.180]   I never post Instagram of my family or my stuff.
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:22.380]   That's the reason why,
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:25.340]   because I'm in a business of fighting,
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:28.620]   and people know that they cannot get to me.
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:34.620]   And I believe, because I was bullied when I was young,
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:38.900]   I didn't realize that when I was young,
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.980]   but it helps me deal with the mental warfare
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:46.020]   that I had to face later on in my life in mixed martial art,
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:48.420]   because it's a very egotistic sport,
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:52.620]   and there's a lot of intimidation.
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:56.540]   And I was used to, I've been used to this thing
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.660]   when I was young, so it does not get to me.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:01.940]   However, the good way to get to me,
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:07.380]   go try to get to someone I love.
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:11.180]   Now, man, I'm gonna go crazy, you know what I mean?
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.180]   And I'm aware of that.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:15.660]   So in order to protect myself, I always,
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:17.860]   because I'm aware I'm a public person,
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:22.700]   so I try to always keep my surrounding in the private.
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:28.780]   - Yeah, one of the ways that your friend of mine, Joe Rogan,
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:31.180]   has been an inspiration,
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:33.900]   that he's got an incredible family,
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:36.260]   and he, for the most part, it started to change recently.
[02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:37.180]   Actually, it's kind of interesting,
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:38.780]   but for the most part, throughout his life,
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:40.900]   he kept it pretty secret.
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:43.020]   Doesn't talk about it in his, he's a comedian.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:44.220]   Comedians talk about everything.
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.260]   He doesn't really talk about it.
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:48.180]   And there's something to that.
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:51.940]   It preserves the magic of the silence of the private life.
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:56.820]   - And I think it can affect the development of the kid
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:01.820]   if the kid grow up being, oh, he's the son of that guy
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:05.700]   instead of being his own person, you know what I mean?
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.500]   So for me, it's very important.
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:11.620]   Like, my parents are older, it's fine,
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.620]   but it taught me a big lesson.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:15.940]   When I'm with my friend at the dinner or anything,
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:18.340]   I talk with personal, we share a thing,
[02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:21.660]   but when I'm talking, I'm aware of the audience
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.420]   who I'm in front.
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:26.300]   - Yeah, but oftentimes, those people are just incredible.
[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:30.060]   It kind of makes me sad that, you know,
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:31.580]   there's a lot of people that love you, right?
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:33.700]   And there are a lot of really incredible people,
[02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:36.620]   and you'll never get to really know their story.
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:37.460]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:38.580]   For me, it makes me sad.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:40.220]   You see them like at airports and stuff.
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:42.300]   People will tell me they listen to this podcast
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:43.900]   or something like that.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:46.140]   And I could tell they're incredible people.
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:48.620]   And it makes me, it's like a little goodbye
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:50.860]   of a possible friend, I don't know.
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:51.980]   It makes me sad.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:52.820]   - You're right.
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:55.180]   - It makes me, it's lonely.
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:57.900]   It's almost like celebrity is a lonely thing.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.220]   So the higher the celebrity,
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:02.460]   the more lonely you become in some kind of way.
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:05.500]   But of course, you have that little gem of a private life
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:06.380]   where you can.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:08.700]   - Personally, I believe every relationship,
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:12.460]   I don't like to use this term,
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:17.220]   but it's always a give and take relationship, you know?
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:19.780]   Like you can gain something and the person,
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:23.740]   like it could be something like not materialistic,
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:26.220]   like something always a good, confident,
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:28.540]   like someone that can give me good advice.
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:32.580]   Or it's a word I would say like extensional.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:35.260]   Like if a pilot has a co-pilot,
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:38.860]   the co-pilot has an extensional relationship with him.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:41.500]   You know, so he knows if he gets sick or he faint,
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:45.300]   he's there to make sure, you know, he's there to help.
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:48.380]   And I think in every relation, it's about compatibility,
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:50.540]   but it's about extensionality, right?
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:54.740]   In a way that if that person is extensional,
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.020]   and sometimes we talk about love, you know,
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:01.220]   like sometimes I think is it a BS word or not?
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:04.140]   Because I myself, sometimes look at,
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:06.180]   I look at myself in the mirror,
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.100]   and when I do stupid thing,
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:10.740]   sometimes I love myself a lot,
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:13.500]   and sometimes I don't, you know what I mean?
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:17.260]   Because I'm angry at myself, I've done stupid thing.
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:20.340]   So that means sometimes love could be fluctuating,
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:21.420]   you know what I mean?
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:22.540]   How about in relationship?
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:25.140]   Sometimes people, they say, oh, they love each other,
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:27.100]   but then when they divorce, they go,
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:30.180]   oh, I want the house and the dog and the kids stay with me.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:31.980]   And you know what I mean?
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:36.260]   If you love, by definition, if you really love someone,
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:40.140]   and let's say you're an old man and you love a woman
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:42.540]   and she decide to leave you for a younger man,
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:43.940]   if you really love her,
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:47.460]   you're gonna help her pack and leave.
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:51.700]   But in our society, sometimes we want to hone something.
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:55.220]   - To me, love includes the missing somebody,
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:57.540]   the losing somebody, the anger at somebody.
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:00.260]   It's all the passion, feelings towards somebody.
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:01.140]   That's all love.
[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:03.340]   Like, you know, it's all part of the thing.
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:04.820]   It's the ups and downs.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.580]   The sad thing is when the feelings towards a person,
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:12.380]   the ups and downs go away, the forgetting.
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:14.100]   That's the opposite of love.
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:16.100]   So the opposite of love isn't hate.
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:18.140]   To me, the opposite of love is forgetting.
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:21.580]   And that's a much bigger,
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:24.700]   the depth of human connection, that's how I see love.
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:26.460]   - Sometimes I try to stay positive
[02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:30.180]   and I've been asked how I try to,
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:33.100]   because I have the image of someone who's positive,
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:36.100]   but I go through my own demon as well sometimes.
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:39.260]   However, we talk about love.
[02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:42.780]   When I was young, you know,
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:47.220]   I didn't love who I was at first.
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:50.180]   That's how I learned to kind of love myself.
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:55.580]   When I was going through bullying,
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:58.660]   I believe I was bullied because I didn't love myself,
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:01.460]   because I project a very bad image
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:03.980]   of what I think of myself.
[02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:05.980]   I was a kid that lacked a lot of confidence.
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:08.380]   I was looking down when I was walking.
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:10.180]   I shrugged my shoulder.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:14.060]   When someone was talking to me, I was avoiding eye contact.
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:17.300]   So I was a very easy target for bullies.
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:22.300]   And I think bullies are like a predatory animal in nature.
[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:25.460]   They will hunt the easier prey.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:29.980]   They don't go, the lion don't go for the alpha bull.
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:32.340]   They go for the one who's hold or who's sick,
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:33.620]   the weakest one.
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:36.540]   And bullies are the same in society, I believe.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:39.700]   And I didn't like to be bullied, of course,
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:42.780]   but I didn't like the person that I was.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:47.700]   But I found out through martial art, the respect.
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:52.980]   And my coach was extraordinary to me.
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:56.420]   He taught me discipline and self-strength.
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:58.780]   And I found out that I needed to,
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:01.820]   in order to love myself, I needed to change myself.
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:04.980]   Because when I looked at myself in the mirror,
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:06.980]   I didn't like what I saw.
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:11.980]   So I decided to become like someone that I would love.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:16.940]   So I tried to look people straight up
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:21.940]   and trying to showcase a more confident image.
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:25.580]   And it was hard in the beginning
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:27.180]   because I didn't really believe in it,
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:31.660]   but I fake it until kind of I make it.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.700]   So when I was walking at school,
[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:37.700]   more and more I was learning how to become more confident.
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:39.900]   And I was like taking charge.
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:41.900]   When the teacher was asking question,
[02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:43.660]   at first I was never answering.
[02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:45.860]   It was like this, waiting always to be the last.
[02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:48.460]   Then I was, hey, I know what the answer,
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.700]   this is the answer.
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:53.620]   I got out of my comfort zone, so to speak.
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:58.100]   And I wish I would tell you that I got out of bullying
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:01.300]   because a Hollywood story,
[02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:04.020]   I use martial art to beat up all the bullies,
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:05.980]   but it's not how it happened to me.
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:09.580]   It happened because I changed myself from the inside out.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:13.980]   And I learn how to,
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.420]   because I didn't love myself in the beginning,
[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:21.140]   I learn how to become like someone that I have loved.
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:24.020]   And even now, like I'm by no mean perfect.
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:25.980]   I do a lot of stupid thing,
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:29.220]   but I learn as a person.
[02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:31.140]   And even I do as something stupid,
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:33.300]   I'm like, shoot, I did something stupid.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:36.940]   At least I can apologize to the person if I realize.
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:41.940]   And then I know that I'm not the person I was in the past.
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:45.220]   I'm the person that I am right now.
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:48.660]   So I can learn and become that image
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:49.900]   of the person that I love.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:53.340]   So in a way, the reason I'm trying to be positive
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:56.140]   and I'm able to stay positive sometime in life
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:02.060]   is because I'm always trying to be like that person
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:03.140]   that I love.
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.260]   And I think if you don't look yourself in the mirror
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:07.060]   and don't love yourself
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:10.180]   or don't see any positive future for yourself,
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:11.580]   how can you change your environment
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:13.260]   if you cannot change yourself?
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:14.300]   You know what I mean?
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:16.820]   You will never be happy if you're not happy
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:18.900]   when you look at yourself in the mirror.
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:21.220]   So change yourself first, then change your...
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.420]   You know, it's not the environment
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:24.100]   that gonna change for yourself.
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:26.260]   You have to go from the inside out.
[02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:30.780]   This I learned through martial art.
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:33.700]   I had a coach, he was incredible.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:36.260]   He used to drill these ideas in my head
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:39.140]   and give me confidence, you know, like this,
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:43.100]   telling me all these beautiful things about myself
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:44.180]   and how I...
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:46.580]   He's dead now, unfortunately, peace to him,
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:49.340]   but he was incredible, incredible.
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:50.500]   He was very, very strict.
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:51.420]   I was afraid of him.
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:53.580]   I was afraid of my dad and afraid of him.
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:56.700]   He couldn't teach nowadays like he used to teach me
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.540]   because he would be probably in jail, you know?
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:02.380]   But I'm glad he did it because for the time being,
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:03.740]   that's what I needed.
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:07.340]   And I would never have had that career
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:10.540]   I had in mixed martial art without this
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:13.820]   because I would never have got out of my comfort zone.
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:15.260]   Would have been impossible.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:17.500]   And in order to improve in life,
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:19.340]   you need to get out of your comfort zone.
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:21.980]   It's hard, it's very hard to do.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:24.580]   - And strive to be the person that you can love.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:28.060]   As beautifully put, George.
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:30.220]   If you were to give advice to a young person today
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:32.700]   about life, what would you tell them?
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:39.340]   - If he takes life with the same,
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:43.740]   with the same mentality that I do,
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:48.740]   if he has the same taste of things that I have,
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:54.020]   I would tell him, you know, for sport,
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:56.700]   for life in general, I would say,
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:01.620]   if you will have a dream, you know, like,
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:08.460]   make everything in your power and work very hard,
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:11.540]   you know, never take no for an answer
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:15.380]   and go through hell in order to achieve it.
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:21.940]   Don't work hard only, but work smart.
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.860]   That's I think the problems with a lot of people.
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.460]   They work hard, they can work hard,
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:30.140]   they burn themselves, but they don't work smart.
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:34.340]   Whether it is in science, in business,
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:38.540]   they make bad choices or they're badly informed.
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:41.420]   In sport, how many guys I've seen
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:43.900]   ruin their career in the gyms?
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:47.620]   They spar so hard, they ruin themselves in the gyms.
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:49.420]   They leave their career in the gyms.
[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:52.340]   What I would say to, for example,
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:54.180]   because my field of expertise,
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:56.340]   it's in sport of mixed martial art.
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:01.900]   I would say to a young kid,
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:05.700]   make your training playful.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:09.500]   You know, when you get ready for competition,
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:13.940]   you need to try to recreate those element
[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:17.860]   that makes you go outside of your comfort zone.
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:21.220]   But in everyday's life in general,
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:23.060]   make your training playful.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:26.220]   Don't make it like a hardcore competition
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:28.420]   about who's winning, who's losing.
[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:29.780]   Make it playful.
[02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:33.220]   So it will increase your,
[02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:38.220]   because you will not be afraid of getting hurt or losing.
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:43.620]   You will be tempted to try more things
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:47.540]   and it will make you become more creative.
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:53.100]   - You know, that brings up another question about learning.
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:57.180]   So you value knowledge and you're exceptional
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:13:00.700]   at basically being very good at learning
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:01.820]   and figuring stuff out,
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:05.420]   new things or going deeper on the things you already know.
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:10.180]   So what advice would you have for how to learn effectively?
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:13.300]   How, you know, you say work smart.
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:16.140]   How do you figure this game out?
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:19.220]   - I believe the best way to learn
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:21.820]   is learning from other people's mistake.
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:24.780]   (both laughing)
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:27.860]   However, I'm not perfect
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:30.420]   and I've learned from my mistakes as well.
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:35.340]   And sometimes it took me a few mistake
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.860]   to learn the same thing.
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:40.460]   But especially in the sport of mixed martial art,
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:44.620]   because we're talking about the failure
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.540]   could have very serious outcome
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:50.540]   on someone's life and wellbeing.
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.580]   So it's crucial to trying to learn
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:56.220]   from other people mistakes.
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:57.660]   - Do you study others?
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:02.140]   - Yes, every fight I've studied my opponent
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:04.700]   and I've studied myself as well to know
[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:12.580]   how my strength mix versus my opponent weaknesses.
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:17.260]   And how can I make the fight go in a way
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:20.700]   that I'm taking my opponent outside of his comfort zone.
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:25.020]   Very often people are good at studying their opponent
[02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:27.100]   but they're not good at looking at themselves in the mirror
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.500]   and knowing what they should do
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:32.940]   in order to maximize their odds of success, right?
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.740]   That's why I always thought for me,
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:42.020]   it was important to not be the best at one thing,
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:45.620]   but be very good at everything.
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:51.140]   That's why I always seek advices
[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:53.860]   from the best in every discipline.
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:58.820]   Like I wrestle with the best wrestler I could be with.
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:00.540]   I box with the best boxers.
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:04.900]   I practice karate with the best karate fighters.
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:05.900]   Same thing in Jiu Jitsu.
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:09.300]   I train Jiu Jitsu with the best Jiu Jitsu guys.
[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:14.100]   However, when I mix everything and mixed martial art,
[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:19.180]   because I'm very competent in every areas.
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:20.980]   So when I'm fighting someone,
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:26.900]   I'm very good at identifying where is the less competent.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:30.780]   And I know for a fact that because I'm competent everywhere
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:33.100]   if I can bring the fight
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:35.220]   where he's outside of his comfort zone,
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:36.820]   it increased my odds of winning.
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:38.460]   There is no certainty.
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:40.500]   It's all about odds, I believe.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:43.700]   Because there is always X factor that you do not control.
[02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:45.180]   - Yeah, it's fascinating to see you actually
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:47.220]   'cause you've been a student of movement.
[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:51.060]   You've been exploring all kinds,
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:52.780]   I mean, gymnastics, all that kind of stuff.
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:54.620]   There's something reminiscent to,
[02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:59.060]   like Conor McGregor is one other martial artist
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:00.660]   that's kind of explored movement,
[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:02.020]   been a scholar of movement.
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:04.500]   At least from my perspective,
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:07.140]   it's very sort of Bruce Lee-like.
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:10.500]   It's almost making a study of the human body
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:12.380]   and all the possible things you can do.
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:14.780]   Is there a philosophy behind that that you have?
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:17.300]   - You talk about Bruce Lee, man.
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:18.980]   You said it best.
[02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:23.620]   He changes my life too.
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.420]   He was ahead of his time.
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:26.580]   - Yeah, incredible.
[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:28.100]   - A lot of people talk to me and they ask me,
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:31.020]   "Hey, is Bruce Lee, would have been able to fight in UFC?"
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:32.980]   I, no.
[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:35.020]   Look, I don't think so.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.340]   I don't know.
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:38.780]   I think he was a martial artist.
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:39.900]   He could have defend himself,
[02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:42.300]   but to say that he could have compete
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:45.300]   amongst the elite of the elite fighter,
[02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:46.340]   perhaps in his time,
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:49.100]   but for sure if you put him in UFC right now,
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:55.060]   the sport has improved incredibly since then.
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:17:00.060]   But in terms of philosophy, yeah, Bruce Lee was amazing.
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:02.820]   One thing that just to prove that he was ahead of his time,
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:05.540]   he was talking about using your longest weapon
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:08.020]   against your opponent nearest point.
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:13.020]   And we see that kick that it got popularized by John Jones,
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:16.820]   you know, the side kick to the thigh.
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:18.860]   It's longest weapon against your nearest point.
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:20.260]   In boxing is the jab,
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:23.260]   but in MMA, when you can use all your weapon,
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:24.740]   that's the kick to the thigh.
[02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:32.340]   I felt there is like kind of three dimension in martial art.
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:34.780]   There is the philosopher like Bruce Lee.
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:39.020]   There is the choreography, the choreograph people.
[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:42.140]   Like for example, you see in movies, the stun people,
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:42.980]   they're incredible.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:45.900]   Like the order one that does like forms in karate,
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:48.380]   like jumping, spin kick, back kick,
[02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:50.620]   like acrobatic stuff, mixed martial art.
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:52.260]   They are unbelievable.
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:56.460]   And there's also the one that compete in fighting.
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:17:58.060]   Like that's what I do.
[02:17:58.060 --> 02:18:01.180]   I personally specialize in.
[02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:03.220]   - Well, you also do the philosophy.
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:04.340]   - I do a little bit of philosophy,
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:06.340]   but that's, you know,
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:08.020]   - That's a consequence of the fighting.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:10.420]   - I guess we are all like,
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:12.340]   we all practice the three dimension
[02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:15.700]   because martial art is, I would say it's,
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.820]   whether you want it or not,
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:20.180]   you have to touch these three dimension,
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:21.940]   but you will specialize in one.
[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:24.660]   I specialize through my life in fighting,
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:27.580]   like the real thing in terms of fighting competition.
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:30.220]   Of course, if you do martial art,
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:31.620]   you will be able to defend yourself
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:33.580]   because it's a self-defense.
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:35.860]   However, you might not be able to fight as an elite
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:39.140]   and the most prestigious organization.
[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:42.860]   And you might not be able to perform the stunt that,
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:46.540]   for example, the stuntman I've done in the series
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:49.300]   I was playing in the Falcon and Winter Soldier.
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:50.780]   These guys are incredible.
[02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:52.740]   They're like real life superhero.
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:55.460]   Things they do, it's, to me,
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:57.300]   like it's fascinating.
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:18:58.500]   It's amazing.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:01.140]   And also Bruce Lee, the philosophy.
[02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:06.140]   How many hours he took thinking about these stuff.
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:10.660]   I'm sure he did not just came out of nowhere.
[02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:14.380]   He was thinking, that's mean he slept on this.
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:16.900]   How many hours?
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.100]   It's just unbelievable.
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.020]   - He's like water, my friend.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:23.220]   How many times has he thought about water going to bed
[02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:24.700]   before he said that?
[02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:27.100]   Oh, let me ask a very important fundamental question
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:27.940]   about martial arts.
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:29.860]   We're both wearing a suit and tie.
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:34.940]   Joe Rogan thinks that wearing a tie is a huge disadvantage.
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:37.340]   Is it clip on or is it an actual tie?
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:38.380]   - It's an actual tie.
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:42.580]   - So do you agree or disagree with Joe Rogan
[02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:47.060]   that wearing a tie is a martial arts
[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:49.780]   significant disadvantage in terms of combat,
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:51.620]   in a combat scenario?
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:55.060]   - In a fight, I think it would be a disadvantage.
[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:55.900]   - Yes.
[02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:56.740]   - Okay, but did this make any sense?
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:59.340]   - I work as a security bouncer in nightclubs
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:02.500]   and I had to work in a certain event
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:04.020]   when I was 18 years old.
[02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:04.860]   - Yes.
[02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:09.140]   - And sometimes I had to work in certain event
[02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:11.580]   that I was in suit and tie.
[02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:16.580]   I never had to use my force to take someone out
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:19.620]   when I was in suit and tie.
[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:21.620]   But if I would have had to,
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:25.140]   before going to the table to physically take the guy out,
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:27.020]   I would have removed my tie
[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:29.260]   and I would have called backup for sure.
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:32.060]   And I would have probably used the element of surprise
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:34.460]   to be first on the guy.
[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:35.300]   - Yes.
[02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:37.740]   - When you're in a bar, same thing.
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:41.260]   You call backup first and you make sure
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:44.340]   you ask the waitress before to clean the table
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.180]   before you go.
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:46.020]   - Yeah.
[02:20:46.020 --> 02:20:48.980]   - And when you go, you have to use the element of surprise.
[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:49.820]   - Yeah.
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:52.420]   - Because fighting in mixed martial art
[02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:55.900]   and fighting in the street, it's two different thing.
[02:20:55.900 --> 02:21:00.140]   And yes, I'm a mixed martial art competitor.
[02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:01.260]   That's what I've done all my life.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:03.500]   But I had a lot of street fight in my life.
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:04.580]   A lot when I was in--
[02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:05.420]   - What's the difference?
[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:06.260]   What's like the--
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:08.500]   - Oh my God, it's a huge difference.
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:11.940]   There is guys that if I would have a choice
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:16.940]   to fight, for example, certain guys in UFC
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:20.140]   in a street fight and fight other guys that are not in UFC,
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:23.420]   I would maybe sometimes pick guys that are not in UFC,
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:24.540]   not necessarily.
[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:28.300]   Because in a street fight, there's no referee that says go.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:29.620]   It's the element of surprise.
[02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:32.980]   And when you're a nice guy, you're not the aggressor.
[02:21:32.980 --> 02:21:35.260]   You always have the element of surprise.
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:36.100]   That's what it taught me.
[02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:37.180]   - Oh, interesting.
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:39.700]   - Yes, because if--
[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:40.540]   - Aggression, you're sacrificing the surprise.
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:43.740]   - The person will not come punch you without warning.
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:46.580]   It needs to trigger some,
[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:49.320]   it's something need to be triggered before.
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:53.220]   So if someone comes because he's looking for trouble,
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:56.020]   there is sign that he's looking for trouble.
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:59.740]   So I was just talking with Bass Ruthen this weekend about it.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:00.820]   - I saw that.
[02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:04.300]   - Every martial art comes from,
[02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:08.460]   like some martial art are from exclusively for competition.
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:12.580]   Like sport karate, like certain martial art.
[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:16.180]   But traditional martial art are for the street,
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:17.940]   are for self-defense.
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:20.180]   And I start my background in Kyokushin karate.
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:22.300]   So it's for, and I did Japanese Jiu Jitsu.
[02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:25.900]   So my background, before I even start training
[02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:28.700]   for mixed martial art, my background is in self-defense.
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:31.700]   And it's very important to understand that
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.620]   in a street fight, the element of surprise is everything.
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:36.140]   And there are no rules.
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:39.140]   You can go for the eyes, the neck, the--
[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:40.660]   - Surprise is everything.
[02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:43.060]   - It's total ball game, you know what I mean?
[02:22:43.060 --> 02:22:45.100]   You have the chair, the beard,
[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:48.180]   there's so much more thing going on.
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.740]   So the idea of, because you are a UFC fighter,
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:54.700]   you think you're invincible, this is BS.
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:58.580]   Anybody can come, like if a big guy who punch very hard,
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:22:59.980]   most people don't know how to punch.
[02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:01.420]   By the way, they don't know how to make a fist
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:02.780]   and throw it in a forward direction.
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:05.260]   But if someone knows how to do it,
[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:06.380]   I don't care who you are.
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:08.140]   If you could be Francis Ngan,
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:10.660]   someone come behind your head and bang.
[02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:12.700]   Or let's say there's an argument
[02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:14.580]   and you get surprised by a punch.
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:16.260]   You can be dropped and lose a fight.
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:17.900]   That doesn't matter.
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:20.100]   The element of surprise is everything.
[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:22.060]   - So you were saying remove all the sources
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:23.260]   of the elements of surprise.
[02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:26.020]   All the, clear the bar, remove the tie.
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:28.020]   I still disagree with you about the tie.
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:30.540]   (laughing)
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:32.460]   - Just for your information,
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:35.260]   if someone comes looking for trouble
[02:23:35.260 --> 02:23:36.780]   and you see me do this,
[02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:40.140]   and going sideways a little bit,
[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:42.460]   that's my position that I'm thinking
[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:43.820]   that maybe something will happen.
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:44.940]   And I'm about--
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:45.780]   - That's a good non-threatening--
[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:47.660]   - I'm about thinking about doing the element.
[02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:50.860]   I'm about to punch you or to do something
[02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:52.180]   to take care of this.
[02:23:52.180 --> 02:23:54.180]   - See, to flip the table on you then,
[02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:58.180]   wearing a tie is communicating the nice guy image.
[02:23:58.180 --> 02:24:00.020]   So it actually gives you the freedom
[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:03.060]   for more elements of surprise by wearing the tie.
[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:05.940]   If you take it off, that's more,
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:08.020]   you're limiting your options.
[02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:09.340]   'Cause nobody's gonna expect the guy
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:10.900]   in the tie to do anything.
[02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:13.980]   - I'm a big believer that sometimes
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:16.700]   it's not only materialism,
[02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:18.260]   it's what you project.
[02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:19.100]   - That's true.
[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:21.260]   - Let's say I had troubles in a bar
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:23.620]   and I was able to deflect,
[02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:25.420]   the guy was looking for trouble talking to me,
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:28.020]   and I was able to deflect his whole aggressivity
[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:30.580]   by saying like, "Hey man, that's a nice shirt.
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:32.380]   "Where did you get it?"
[02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:35.300]   Like saying something stupid like this.
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:38.380]   Then it kind of break the momentum.
[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:41.020]   But the guy was looking for trouble.
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:42.620]   I don't wanna fight you.
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:43.460]   I don't wanna fight you,
[02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:47.260]   but I'm not gonna wait until you pull,
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:48.820]   you make the first move.
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:51.620]   Because the minute you touch me,
[02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:53.300]   you push me or you touch me,
[02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:54.180]   you declare war.
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:56.420]   And the war is unleashed my friend.
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:58.740]   And I'm taking you out of order
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:01.380]   with the necessary force of course.
[02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:02.220]   You know what I mean?
[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:05.060]   That's the thing with martial art.
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:08.580]   If you use the necessary force to take out a problem,
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:09.500]   it's okay.
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:12.420]   But if you take advantage of it,
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.740]   that's when it's not all right,
[02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:15.260]   because it's a weapon.
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:17.540]   So if someone comes up to me,
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:18.380]   that's my position.
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:21.340]   And now I'm assessing the situation.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:24.580]   That's how they teach in self-defense.
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:26.580]   Here, never put your hands down.
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:27.980]   Always hand there.
[02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:29.860]   'Cause I'm boom or boom.
[02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:33.220]   Like this is very important.
[02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:34.620]   And you never,
[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:36.340]   you're always your center line on the side.
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.260]   Ah yeah, like this.
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:40.460]   If someone knows martial art,
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:42.260]   he will recognize that pattern.
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:43.180]   But if you go like this,
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:45.420]   if someone talks to you and you go like this,
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:47.940]   that's mean you're telling the guy that you wanna fight,
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:48.780]   you don't wanna do that.
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:49.940]   You don't wanna, ah yeah.
[02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:54.540]   That's the position.
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:55.860]   'Cause your hands are here.
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:57.700]   Whatever you can do, you're here.
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:59.820]   - Well, also your ear tells the story.
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:03.580]   - It's not everybody that knows that, however.
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:05.740]   Some people might think that it's my mom
[02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:07.180]   grabbed me by the ear and pulled me
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:09.460]   because I didn't listen to her.
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.540]   A real fight in the street
[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:14.660]   and a fight in mixed martial art is a different ball game.
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:16.900]   - What do you think is the best martial art
[02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:19.180]   to prepare you for street fighting?
[02:26:19.180 --> 02:26:21.660]   People often kind of have this discussion of jujitsu,
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:24.060]   maybe boxing, maybe wrestling.
[02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:25.220]   Do you think,
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:27.500]   when you talk about a young person studying martial arts
[02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:28.900]   to prepare themselves.
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:31.380]   - For a street fight,
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:34.220]   it's often much different than a mixed martial art fight.
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:38.780]   And I know there's a lot of BS in the world of martial art,
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:40.460]   like self-defense stuff.
[02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:45.460]   But I believe self-defense is very important
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:49.860]   in a way to understand the situation,
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:54.860]   to understand those situations that might occur,
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:57.700]   how to deal with it.
[02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:02.620]   Because not necessarily that we talk about the technicality,
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:06.060]   we talk about the tacticality, the tactics.
[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:08.900]   Like when I'm talking to you about the element of surprise,
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:10.500]   it's important, this is not technique.
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:13.340]   A technique is a punch or techniques
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:18.060]   that I physically will use to enable my opponent,
[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:19.900]   my aggressor.
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:21.980]   Tactic is the tactic I'm telling you about
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:23.500]   is in a street fight.
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:24.820]   If someone is looking for trouble
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:28.100]   and I feel the heat rising as the conversation goes,
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:29.220]   that's the position I'm gonna take.
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:32.340]   And I have to be first.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:34.540]   I cannot let him go first.
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:36.500]   So I have to strike first or do something.
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:41.500]   This is the first thing that generally I have to agree on.
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:47.020]   After that, of course, there's the knowledge.
[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:48.580]   If you're a professional fighter,
[02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:51.300]   you have a huge advantage.
[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:53.700]   Once the fight is started, the war is declared,
[02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:55.820]   now everything goes.
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:58.180]   But generally speaking,
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:02.060]   the person that will have the first blow
[02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:05.340]   or the first punch
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:08.260]   will have a huge advantage.
[02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:09.940]   It's like doing a hundred meter race
[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:11.540]   and having a headstart.
[02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:14.860]   - And that you can't prepare for with any martial art.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:17.660]   - Yeah, and if I'm a smart guy, I know how to fight.
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:21.020]   If a guy like an heavyweight champion comes to me
[02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:26.020]   or like, you know, I know what to do to disable him.
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:30.420]   Like boom, or here, or the neck, you know?
[02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:33.660]   Like, and if you blind him, what is he gonna do?
[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:34.820]   You know what I mean?
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:37.500]   So, or a bottle, you know what I mean?
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:40.780]   So, the element of surprise is, it's everything.
[02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:44.660]   So, that's why it's always good to be the nice guy
[02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:45.620]   and not looking for trouble,
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:47.460]   because if you're not looking for trouble,
[02:28:47.460 --> 02:28:48.380]   you have the headstart,
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:50.500]   you have the option of having a headstart.
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:52.500]   - So, what you're saying is being a nice guy
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:54.180]   is the best form of self-defense,
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.740]   maybe a little humor too.
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:58.020]   - You know, I have learned that.
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:00.020]   I've learned that when I was a kid.
[02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:04.460]   I was about maybe seven, six years old.
[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:06.820]   We used to play, in Montreal, there's a lot of snow.
[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:09.620]   We used to play King of the Mountain.
[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:13.460]   That's the first combat lesson that I've learned in my life.
[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:15.380]   And I managed, somehow, it was a lot of kids,
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:17.380]   I managed to get on the top of the mountain.
[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:20.740]   And another guy came in on top of the mountain,
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:24.660]   and he was angry that I was there before him.
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:27.180]   When you play King of the Mountain,
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:29.100]   it was a mountain of snow,
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:31.900]   you don't strike each other, we just wrestle and push.
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.180]   And I managed to be first.
[02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:35.900]   And when he came, he says to me,
[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:38.900]   say, "Okay, you wanna fight?"
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:40.020]   And I said, "Yeah."
[02:29:40.020 --> 02:29:41.940]   I didn't know what he mean, like, "I wanna fight,
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:42.780]   "you wanna wrestle?"
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:45.060]   He said, "I say yes."
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:47.580]   He punched me right in the face, boom.
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:51.260]   And then I fall on the bottom of the mountain.
[02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:53.340]   Then when I fall down,
[02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:54.820]   I remember that vision in my life,
[02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:59.420]   because I will remember that for the rest of my life.
[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:00.980]   I'm about to stand up,
[02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:02.740]   and I see the blood coming out of my nose.
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:06.740]   I see the snow is red because my nose is bleeding.
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:11.340]   Now I remember the limit of surprises, everything.
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:13.700]   My first street fight, I lost it.
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:15.020]   I got, I didn't get knocked out,
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:19.420]   but I got dropped on the bottom of the snow mountain.
[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:20.780]   And I was like, "Ah, he got me,"
[02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:22.100]   because I was not expecting it.
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:24.940]   My hand, I was not expecting a punch.
[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:29.940]   So from there, when I felt the heat during an argument
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:31.460]   or something was not right,
[02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:33.340]   I always stroke first.
[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:34.780]   I didn't win all my fight,
[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:37.780]   because sometimes there were more than one guys on me,
[02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:41.620]   you know, but I think it's important
[02:30:41.620 --> 02:30:43.820]   to not be the aggressor,
[02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:45.860]   so you have the element of surprise,
[02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:47.460]   and always use that in your favor.
[02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:48.900]   - That's so brilliant.
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:51.180]   Let me go from the very practical
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:54.260]   to the most impractically huge question
[02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:55.900]   about the meaning of life.
[02:30:55.900 --> 02:31:00.900]   You said that when great depths of unrelenting sorrow
[02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:04.820]   punctuated by great peaks of joy and liberation,
[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:06.700]   the result is delicious.
[02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:09.660]   So what do you think is the meaning
[02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:13.700]   of this whole journey that we're on, this life?
[02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:16.340]   What makes life delicious?
[02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:19.460]   - To me, you know,
[02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:22.860]   satisfaction is the M for me.
[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:26.340]   Like I always, if I'm satisfied,
[02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:29.380]   that's mean I have no, nothing to live for.
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:31.860]   I'm not talking only about my career,
[02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:33.340]   I'm talking about my life.
[02:31:33.340 --> 02:31:34.580]   What do you want in your life?
[02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:36.980]   You want kids, you want a family,
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:37.900]   you want to be champion.
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:38.980]   What do you want in your life?
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:41.700]   You have like a long-term goal, short-term goal?
[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:48.580]   In mixed martial art, I achieve what I needed to achieve.
[02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:50.460]   I'm satisfied.
[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:52.060]   I'm no longer the same Josh St-Pierre
[02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:54.900]   than when I was begging for a title shot on my knees.
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:57.820]   I move on from it.
[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:02.340]   Now I had a chance to go into movies.
[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:06.860]   Now that same insane,
[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:10.940]   that same insane drive that I had to be
[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:15.020]   the champion in the world, now I put it into acting.
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:16.860]   Like I'm having a lot of acting class now
[02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:20.540]   and luckily for me, the timing was amazing.
[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:24.420]   I got cast for "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"
[02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:26.420]   that is on Disney+ channel.
[02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:31.460]   It's a huge, huge project to be part of for me
[02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:34.820]   because it's like you play basketball,
[02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:37.100]   you have a chance to go for the NBA right away.
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:38.740]   I was very lucky.
[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:41.100]   The timing was just too perfect.
[02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:45.900]   And so you need to constantly challenging yourself
[02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:48.100]   and having goals to achieve.
[02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:52.580]   You know, like keep your brain activated, like keep working.
[02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:56.500]   And the proof of that is that you see sometimes
[02:32:56.500 --> 02:33:00.580]   some old people, like when they retire,
[02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:03.340]   very often, sometime you see that they got sick
[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.940]   and they die or because they...
[02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:09.620]   It's either because sometime we think we...
[02:33:09.620 --> 02:33:16.020]   We make, we benefit, we do something good for them
[02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:20.220]   by making not work and giving them a break.
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:21.060]   So in our mind, we're like,
[02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:23.780]   "Oh, he's going to be able to relax."
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:26.100]   But in their mind, it's not good
[02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:28.060]   because they're not busy, they have nothing to live for.
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:31.020]   Like my dad is used to work all the time
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:33.380]   and he has always something to do.
[02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:35.020]   He's retired now.
[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:39.300]   I myself now call him by force to find him some job.
[02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:42.380]   "Hey, dad, can you come in my house?
[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:44.100]   I have this thing to repair.
[02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:44.940]   I don't know how to do it."
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:48.300]   So it gives him a reason,
[02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:50.260]   not to live because he has other things to do,
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:53.300]   but what I mean is also in life,
[02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:57.860]   I think you always don't be afraid to aim high.
[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:01.740]   Don't be afraid to fix your objective very high
[02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:04.020]   and never be able to reach it.
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:06.020]   - Be afraid of reaching your goals, essentially.
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:08.220]   I mean, you always have to keep moving it out.
[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:09.980]   You think there's a...
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:11.020]   It's an interesting question
[02:34:11.020 --> 02:34:14.660]   'cause you've been acting in some really exciting things.
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:17.620]   Do you think there's a dramatic role
[02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:22.620]   where it's basically, you go full Robert De Niro in "Taxi"
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:27.100]   driver, do you think there'll be a full length feature film
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:28.140]   with Georges St-Pierre?
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:31.780]   - I liken there's level to this thing.
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:35.580]   I'm aware that I have to restart as a white belt.
[02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:38.380]   And for some people, it could be discouraging,
[02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:39.820]   but for me, man, it's great.
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:41.020]   I love it.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:42.020]   I freaking love it.
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:44.020]   I embrace it because everybody told me
[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:47.300]   like I would never be able to do it and it's fine.
[02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:52.300]   But, and also the outcome of a failure
[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:57.260]   in the sport of mixed martial art is much more serious
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:00.580]   than the outcome of a failure for a movie, for example.
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:03.220]   For if you zig when you should zag in a fight,
[02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:04.060]   you get knocked out.
[02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:06.180]   If you zig when you should zag in on set,
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:07.660]   oh, cut, we'll do it again.
[02:35:07.660 --> 02:35:13.860]   And I know that I will be most likely be chosen
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:19.780]   for action martial art roles because that's my background.
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:21.780]   There is this new trend in Hollywood now
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:24.780]   when they want someone to play an Italian guy,
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:27.820]   they're gonna choose a real Italian person.
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:29.580]   When they want someone to play a Russian guy,
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:30.780]   they're gonna choose someone
[02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:33.220]   who has a real Russian background.
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:36.620]   Now they want a real martial art fighter.
[02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:38.220]   I've done fighting all my life.
[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:40.180]   I just need to improve my acting skill.
[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:43.860]   But when I train in acting,
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:46.220]   I get myself out of my comfort zone.
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:48.420]   I'm not playing a role of a martial art guy.
[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:52.540]   I'm playing like romance, comedy, drama.
[02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:56.660]   So when I go on set and playing the role
[02:35:56.660 --> 02:36:00.260]   of a badass martial art guy, it's easier.
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:02.380]   So like in training for a fight,
[02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:07.380]   I always make my preparation harder than the actual task.
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:10.100]   - I would love to see where,
[02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:11.300]   I don't know if you've seen the "Wrestler"
[02:36:11.300 --> 02:36:13.100]   with Mickey Rourke.
[02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:13.940]   - Oh yeah.
[02:36:13.940 --> 02:36:16.540]   - Those types of films, I would love to,
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:19.260]   I would love to you do something like that.
[02:36:19.260 --> 02:36:22.820]   If not now, then in 10, 20 years, I could see that.
[02:36:22.820 --> 02:36:23.660]   That would be amazing.
[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:25.300]   There's levels to the game, right?
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:26.460]   - Yes, it's gradual.
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:29.860]   And I'm aware that I don't wanna take something
[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:32.540]   on my shoulder that I won't be able to deliver.
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:33.820]   It's like a fighter who wants to go
[02:36:33.820 --> 02:36:35.500]   for a title shot right away,
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:38.460]   it could very well break him.
[02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:39.300]   You know what I mean?
[02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:41.300]   And I don't wanna do that because I know,
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:43.500]   I've done some gigs in the past,
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:45.140]   but I was not focusing on it
[02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:48.900]   because I was focusing on competing as a martial art,
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:52.020]   martial artist in competition in MMA.
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:53.660]   But now I take it very seriously.
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:56.020]   So I cannot do the same mistake again
[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:57.140]   because I've done some stuff,
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:37:00.140]   I've done it for the money and it was good.
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:03.140]   It was fun to be beat up by Jacques-Claude Van Damme,
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:04.340]   Steven Seagal and everything,
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:08.620]   but my acting was not on point at that time.
[02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:13.620]   So every time I'm gonna come back from now on, on screen,
[02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:16.380]   I need to be sharp because you cannot mess it up.
[02:37:16.380 --> 02:37:19.220]   If you mess it up, it's like a loss on your record.
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:21.340]   You're not taken seriously.
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:23.020]   So that's how I see it.
[02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:27.740]   And it's very fun because I had a chance
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:28.940]   to talk to a lot of guys.
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:31.420]   And on top of all the class that I'm having,
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:34.820]   like a few days ago, I was with Danny Trujillo.
[02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:38.740]   And I always seek the advice of actors
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:40.580]   when I see some of them that,
[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:42.780]   because I really admire how they do,
[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:44.140]   how they project their emotion.
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:47.060]   And I asked him, Danny Trujillo, I said to him,
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:50.460]   he's an amazing guy, by the way, very nice guy.
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:51.620]   And I asked him, I say,
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:54.380]   how do you do to be,
[02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:57.820]   because you scared the hell out of me,
[02:37:57.820 --> 02:38:00.820]   how do you do to be so scary?
[02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:03.020]   Like, what is your trick?
[02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:03.860]   And he tells me, he's like,
[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:08.860]   "George, if you threaten someone and you scream at him,
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:10.980]   "I'm gonna kill you."
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:15.340]   It's not as scary if you're smiling and you say,
[02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:18.260]   I'm gonna kill you.
[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:21.100]   And he says also to me that,
[02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:22.940]   another advice he gave me is like,
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:25.180]   when you say this,
[02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:28.420]   think about you killing him for real,
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:31.100]   that how you hate him and how you're gonna kill him.
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:35.060]   So the camera will take the emotion out.
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:36.860]   Don't try physically to do that.
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:38.860]   That's a mistake I used to do before.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:42.020]   I used to physically show that I'm strong and angry
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:44.180]   and to be mean.
[02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:47.100]   So these are just an example of tricks
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:49.940]   that I learned sometimes when I met an actor.
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:53.180]   I always try to learn from everybody that I met in my life.
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:54.220]   - It's a difficult journey
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:57.180]   'cause then you have to go to some dark places as a person,
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:01.340]   'cause you really have to imagine some dark things.
[02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:02.780]   It's fascinating, actually.
[02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:04.380]   - I think a lot of the actor,
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:08.300]   they have sometimes problems because of that.
[02:39:08.300 --> 02:39:09.660]   Because now I understand why.
[02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:12.420]   If you work on your bicep,
[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:15.060]   your bicep will grow, right?
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:18.260]   Because it's the stress that you put on it
[02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:19.980]   that will make it grow, right?
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:23.140]   Emotions, I believe, are the same way.
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:28.140]   If you're used to dig inside of you down deep
[02:39:28.140 --> 02:39:31.580]   to make your negative emotion,
[02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:34.380]   depressive emotion comes out,
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:37.060]   if something bad in your life happen,
[02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:40.340]   you will fall into those emotion much more rapidly
[02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:43.420]   that someone who does not that every day.
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:44.260]   You know what I mean?
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:45.860]   Because it's like a muscle memory.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.660]   Like if you program yourself to react a certain way,
[02:39:48.660 --> 02:39:51.580]   you will reach that point very often.
[02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:53.780]   So that's why sometimes you see some guys,
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:56.900]   we often blame it on drug,
[02:39:56.900 --> 02:39:58.820]   but I think it's also because of the acting.
[02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:02.020]   They're used to be so on the hop top
[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:04.140]   and sometimes they go to the down deep.
[02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:08.060]   So they're both extreme, you know?
[02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:09.540]   - You gotta be psychologically tough.
[02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:10.380]   And that's life.
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:12.700]   This is, I'm so excited to see you challenge yourself
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:14.060]   in that direction.
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:16.940]   - That's one thing that I'm a little bit afraid
[02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:19.180]   that happened to me.
[02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:23.740]   I really hope I'll always be, you know,
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:26.540]   like having a problem to control my emotion
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:29.060]   be too much extreme. - Oh, yeah.
[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:30.420]   - I hope it does not happen to me.
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:35.420]   And if I feel that I'm going towards that,
[02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:40.420]   I'm gonna, you know, give up on my new objective
[02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:42.780]   and find something else to achieve.
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:44.660]   - But in your personal life,
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:46.460]   you wanna be real with your emotions.
[02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:49.380]   You don't want to, it doesn't, you know,
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:50.340]   just like with biceps,
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:52.540]   you don't want biceps that are too big.
[02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:56.100]   - You are real, but you are extreme real.
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:41:00.140]   And that's the, that's what I think.
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:01.580]   Sometimes it could happen to actors
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:04.220]   when they go too much into their emotion.
[02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:05.780]   Like we talk about like sometimes guys
[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:09.620]   that commit suicide, perhaps, you know,
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:12.060]   I don't know, because I don't know their real life,
[02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:15.740]   but it could be something that they get so much
[02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:17.180]   into their character.
[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:18.900]   I didn't understand it at first
[02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:20.780]   because I never had acting class,
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:23.100]   but after a while that you have acting class now,
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:24.620]   you start to realize that, yeah,
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:28.620]   I understand why some actor get caught up in their emotion,
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:33.540]   because that can have an influence on their life, right?
[02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:36.980]   - You're on a fascinating journey, George.
[02:41:36.980 --> 02:41:39.060]   I can't tell you how much it means to me
[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:40.580]   that you'd be so nice to me,
[02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:42.260]   that you'll give me so much respect.
[02:41:42.260 --> 02:41:44.740]   Just that tells everything I need to know
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:45.820]   about you as a human being.
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:47.620]   With everything you've accomplished,
[02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:51.180]   you waste all your time and you're so nice to me
[02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.100]   just as a fellow human being, man.
[02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:55.660]   I have so much respect, I'm so honored.
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:58.580]   And the energy you give me by just even showing up here,
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:00.540]   I'll carry that forward for a long time to come.
[02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:01.380]   George, I love it.
[02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:02.540]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:05.220]   - No, thank you, Lex, for having me on the show.
[02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:07.780]   I've been looking to talk to you for a long time.
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:09.540]   For me, talking to a guy like you,
[02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:13.380]   it's a great learning experience because I always learn.
[02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:16.580]   And life is fascinating to me
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:20.380]   and all the experience that we have in life,
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:22.300]   it's something that can make us grow.
[02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:27.260]   And this experience for me just make me grow as well.
[02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:29.140]   Plus we look pretty damn sharp today.
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:30.580]   - Men in black, my friend.
[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:31.940]   - Men in black.
[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:32.780]   Thanks, George.
[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:33.620]   (laughing)
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:35.140]   - Nice.

[02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:53.420]   from Miyamoto Musashi.
[02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:56.620]   Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
