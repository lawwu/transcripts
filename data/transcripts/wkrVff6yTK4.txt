[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   For it is the power of vision to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:18.280]   to the Greek; for therein is this righteousness of God revealed by faith, even as it is written,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680]   that just shall live by faith.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.800]   Now that's his great theme, and it is his great theme right away to the end of this
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.880]   fourth chapter.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320]   But you remember that he felt it was necessary that he should make it quite clear.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.140]   He first of all has to make it quite clear that everybody has need of this salvation.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.000]   So he proves that in chapter one from verse eighteen to the end, that the Gentiles are
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.460]   in a desperate need of it.
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.800]   Then in chapter two he proves that the Jews are in equal need of it.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.360]   I'm not worrying you with the subdivisions this evening.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.320]   I'm just giving you the broad outline.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.360]   And so he arrives at that conclusion that there is no difference between the Jew and
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.080]   the Greek.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.760]   But then he takes up an objection at the beginning of chapter three.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360]   Somebody may ask, in the light of all this, what advantage then hath the Jew, or what
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.320]   profit is there of circumcision?
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.840]   And then he proceeds, you remember, to deal with that, and then sums it all up again by
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.680]   that tremendous list of quotations from the Old Testament which proves that the whole
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.200]   world is guilty before God, that there is none righteous, no, not one, that all have
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   sinned and come short of the glory of God, that there is therefore no difference whatsoever
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.280]   between the Jew and nor the Gentile, that thus God is just before the whole world and
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   the whole world is guilty before him.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.200]   And then you remember, having dealt with those difficulties and objections, in the twenty-first
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   verse of the third chapter he comes back again to a positive exposition of this great theme
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.320]   of justification by faith only.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.280]   And from verse twenty-one to verse thirty-one in the third chapter we have the classical
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.480]   and undoubtedly the greatest statement on the subject of justification by faith and
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.200]   incidentally of the atonement that is to be found anywhere in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.400]   And now you would have thought that he really had finished, but he hasn't, because still
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   he can see that there were certain difficulties, and difficulties especially in the minds of
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.840]   the Jews, because they are concerned about this whole question of Abraham.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.160]   What shall we say then, he says in verse one of the fourth chapter, that Abraham, our father
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.640]   as pertaining to the flesh, hath found.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   And then he proves, as we saw, that the case of Abraham, far from being a difficulty, proves
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.160]   this very contention, because the Scripture itself has said that his faith was reckoned
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.960]   to him for righteousness.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   It was imputed to him, counted to him for righteousness.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   And then he brings in a quotation from David in the Psalms, but back again he comes to
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.760]   Abraham, "What about circumcision?" says someone.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.320]   Surely this must make a difference, it must count.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.040]   Once again he is able to prove that far from being a kind of objection to this doctrine,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.920]   it once more proves because Abraham was justified before he was circumcised.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.480]   It wasn't because he was circumcised, it was before he was circumcised, and circumcision
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   was but the sign given to him, the sealing of his justification and his righteousness.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.640]   "What about the law then?" says someone.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.120]   Well he says exactly the same thing again.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.640]   All this had happened to Abraham before the law was given, and therefore it cannot be
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.120]   that justification is by the law.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.520]   The law worketh wrath and condemnation.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.600]   It can't save.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.000]   It was never meant to.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.200]   Even so, when you come to verses 16 and 17 in this fourth chapter, the apostle Verily
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.120]   has dealt with all the arguments.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.400]   He has met every conceivable objection.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   He has been patient.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   He has taken his time.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.600]   He hasn't hurried the thing at all.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.080]   He has given full weight to everything that can be said against the doctrine.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.000]   And having considered them all, he says, "Therefore," here is the final statement, "it is of faith
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.960]   that it might be by grace, of grace to the end that the promise might be sure to all
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   the seed."
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:51.040]   And again he mentions it, "not to that which is of the law only, but to that also which
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.520]   is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, before whom he believed, whom he
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.760]   believed even God, who quickneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   they were."
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   Very well.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.640]   There, I say, is the end of the argument.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.680]   But now the apostle, it seems to me, felt at this point that he just couldn't leave
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   it like that.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.040]   Not that he is going to argue any further, but he does feel that this case of Abraham
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.960]   is such a big one and such an important one that it does provide a very perfect illustration
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.840]   in this whole question of justification by faith.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   In other words, he is saying something like this.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.960]   Now he says, "I am trying to show you that justification is by faith only.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.040]   And if any of you are in trouble as to what faith means, or as to how justification does
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.240]   come to us by faith, well, there it is.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.360]   I have argued it out in theory, as it were.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.640]   Let us look at it in operation.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.040]   Let us look at it in practice.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.920]   Do you know what faith is?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.720]   Do you know the characteristics of faith?"
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   "Very well," he says, "let us look at Abraham.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.960]   I have been using his name as an argument.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.200]   The Jews are bringing it up as an objection.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.880]   Let us exactly see together what really did happen in this case of Abraham.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.480]   Abraham was justified by faith.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.400]   Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.280]   Very well.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.840]   There is no clearer or more dramatic statement as to the nature of faith, possibly anywhere
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.400]   in the Scripture, than we have in these verses that we are now looking at together.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.560]   Here, I say, the great elements in faith are laid open before us in a particularly clear
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.440]   manner.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.520]   And all we have got to do, therefore, is to follow the apostle as he gives us the details
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.400]   and shows us their importance, and thus introduces us to this whole subject of faith.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.440]   Now this can be used in two ways.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.360]   The apostle's primary object here, as we shall see, is to show us, as he says in verses
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.280]   23 and 24, "Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, but
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.720]   for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.000]   our Lord from the dead."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.960]   That is his primary object.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   But at the same time, what the apostle here says about the faith of Abraham is always
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:44.080]   true about faith—faith in every application, faith not only for justification, faith for
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:52.800]   living, faith for battling, faith for surmounting obstacles, faith in the whole range of its
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   great activities.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.080]   So, I say, at one and the same time, as we are looking at justification by faith, we
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.040]   shall be learning something about faith itself, the things which always characterize it.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.480]   I am not at all sure, but that this is indeed the greatest definition of faith which you
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.040]   will find anywhere in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.600]   And when I say that, I am even bearing in mind the great eleventh chapter of the epistle
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.400]   to the Hebrews.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.360]   All the great elements are here in such a short compass before us, and therefore let
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   us look at them.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.160]   Now, then, what does he say?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.520]   Well, the first thing he tells us is this.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:45.320]   He makes the statement that Abraham became the father of many nations, who against hope
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.600]   believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.880]   According to that which was spoken, "So shall thy seed be."
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.200]   Now this is the thing with which we must start.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   This is the astounding thing that is true in the history of Abraham, that one man thus
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.400]   became the father of many nations.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.840]   Now we are dealing with history.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.920]   This is not theory, this is historical truth, historical fact.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.960]   It is the record that you read of in your Old Testament, the great story of the beginning
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.520]   of the children of Israel.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   And that is why the psalmists and the prophets so frequently ask the children of Israel to
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.600]   go back to the story.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.560]   Look again, they say, at the rock from which you have been hewn.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.200]   It is Abraham, Abraham your father, children of Abraham, Abraham's seed.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.040]   Now that is the fact, the great fact with which we are concerned.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.960]   Very well, therefore the second thing I note is this, that the apostle says that this happened
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:12.560]   to Abraham and became true of him as the result of his faith and through his faith alone,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.120]   who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.940]   That is how it has come to pass.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:28.160]   It is because of his faith, it is through the medium of his faith, the instrumentality
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.040]   of his faith, that all this has become true of Abraham.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.880]   Very well then, let us look at it like this.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:45.160]   What was it exactly that Abraham's faith enabled him to do?
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.480]   Now the apostle answers the question here, and there are five answers to the question.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:58.400]   The first thing that Abraham's faith enabled him to do was that it enabled him to believe
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:07.800]   God's word of promise, that staggering word of promise that God made to Abraham.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   What was this?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:16.760]   Well, it is all summarized for us by the apostle in one phrase, "So shall thy seed be."
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.600]   You notice how he puts it like that in the 18th verse, "Who against hope believed in
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:28.080]   hope that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken."
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.160]   And he sums up everything that God said to Abraham in just that one phrase, "So shall
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.680]   thy seed be."
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.680]   What does it mean?
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.800]   Well, here it is, and it is one of the most amazing and astounding things that God has
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.880]   ever said to men.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:56.400]   The first thing it means is this, that Abraham was to have a very large and numerous natural
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   progeny.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   You remember God used two illustrations when he told him this.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.800]   He said, "As the sand by the seashore is innumerable and you can't count it, so shall thy seed
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   be.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.240]   Or as the stars in the heavens are, go out and try and count them, and you'll find you
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   can't count them.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.680]   Well, in the same way, you won't be able to count your own natural progeny."
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.080]   Now, let's remember the staggering character of this.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.120]   Here is a man who is drawing on for a hundred, and his wife the same, and they haven't a
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.640]   child, and yet God makes this astounding statement to him about his natural progeny.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   Faith, I say, enabled Abraham to believe that, but that doesn't exhaust this little word,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.880]   "So, so shall thy seed be."
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.920]   It includes that, but it doesn't stop at that.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.360]   The second thing it means is this.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:58.760]   When God said all this to Abraham, he was at the same time speaking to him about another
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:04.320]   seed, not only his natural descendants.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.920]   He was speaking to him of one in particular.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.880]   You remember the argument of this apostle Paul in the epistle to the Galatians in chapter
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.400]   3, in the 16th verse, the most important statement.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.240]   He says, "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:31.920]   He saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ."
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.640]   Now we've got to include this.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.680]   I have already made that clear when we were dealing with the first part of this fourth
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.640]   chapter, but I must refresh your memories this evening.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.120]   The statement, the promise that was made to Abraham, was not simply about his natural
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.920]   seed and progeny.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:59.120]   He definitely made to Abraham this promise concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   He told Abraham that out of his lines and amongst his descendants was going to be the
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.760]   great Savior, the Messiah, the deliverer of his people.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:16.320]   Now you remember how I quoted to you that our Lord himself makes that perfectly clear
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.600]   in the eighth chapter of the gospel according to St. John in verse 56, where he said to
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:34.040]   the Jews, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad."
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.720]   Now the apostle Paul is including that here.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:45.240]   It's a very serious misunderstanding of God's promise to Abraham to confine it only to his
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.280]   natural seed and to the land of Israel.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.320]   The astounding thing is this, that God there revealed to Abraham the whole plan and way
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.960]   of salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.640]   He didn't see it very clearly, but he saw it.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.040]   Abraham was given to see a way back at that point that salvation was not by works, not
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.680]   by anything a man does, but that God was going to save.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.880]   He was going to save by sending his son, who after the flesh was going to be of the seed
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:24.200]   of Abraham, so that in this word "so" we have included not only the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:30.960]   himself, but the way of salvation through his death, through his blood, through his
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.680]   crucifixion.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:41.040]   God revealed to Abraham that he was going to set him forth as a propitiation for sins.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.240]   He told it him again in a sense in the incident of the sacrifice of Isaac.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.960]   But God revealed it to Abraham, and Abraham saw it.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.480]   "So shall thy seed be."
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.560]   Let us never forget then that it includes the Son of God after the flesh and the whole
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.020]   plan and purpose and way of salvation.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:10.360]   But it's got a third element in it, and that of course is this, the thing that the
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.720]   apostles kept on repeating in this chapter.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:21.280]   And that is that the Gentiles also are going to come into this salvation.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.880]   Not of the Jews only, he says, not of them which are of the law only, but also all these
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:34.560]   others who are of the faith of our father Abraham, which he had yet being uncircumcised.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.580]   So that when God said to him, "So shall thy seed be," he was saying, as the quotation
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:48.420]   reminds us, that Abraham was going to be the father of many nations in a spiritual sense.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.860]   He is the father of the Jews only in the natural sense.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.560]   He is not the natural father of these Gentile nations, but he is their spiritual father.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.520]   He is the father of many nations.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.800]   And of course, the history of the Christian church has verified all that and proved it
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   and substantiated it.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.960]   They come from the east and the west, from all directions, and sit down with Abraham,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.160]   Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.480]   Out of all tribes and nations and languages and tongues, they come and they are all the
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.840]   seed of Abraham, children of Abraham.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   Why?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.600]   Because they are children of faith.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.400]   Abraham is the father of all who are justified by faith.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.520]   Therefore this word "so" includes all that.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:47.560]   Very well then, here I summarize once more, is the first thing that Abraham's faith
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.520]   enabled him to do.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:58.440]   It enabled him to believe this staggering promise in all the fullness that I have just
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.840]   been describing to you.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:15.640]   But secondly, it enabled him to believe that on the bare word of God, nothing else whatsoever.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.360]   Abraham had nothing to go on when he believed this except the mere statement of God.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.040]   Here he is, as we were reminded in the seventeenth verse, standing before him whom he believed
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:33.600]   even God, with the stars looking down upon him, standing there in his solitariness.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.320]   And God made this tremendous statement, "This God who quickneth the dead and calleth those
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.000]   things which be not as though they were."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   God made this statement to him, and Abraham on that alone believed it.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.480]   There was nothing but the bare word of God.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.600]   That's the second thing that faith does, and that is a marvelous characteristic of
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   faith.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.840]   There is something naked about faith.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.440]   It doesn't ask for proofs, it doesn't seek them.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.960]   In a sense, it doesn't need them.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:12.280]   Faith is that which is content with the bare word of God, because he is God.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.960]   Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:25.200]   But wait a minute, I must elaborate that, and here is my third point.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.960]   Abraham's faith enabled him to believe this staggering promise, merely on the word of
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:38.280]   God, and in spite of all appearances to the contrary.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   We have to add that because it is here for us, "who against hope believe in hope."
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:54.800]   Now it is clear that what he means is this, that there really was no hope whatsoever for
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.480]   this speaking in a natural sense.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.400]   Everything was against it.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.760]   What were the things that were against it?
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.320]   Well here is one of them.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.880]   Abraham's own body, now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, and moreover the
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.520]   deadness of Sarah's womb.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.040]   Where was there any conceivable hope that Abraham and Sarah might have a child?
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.240]   There was none at all.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.200]   It was impossible.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.360]   Everything was against it.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.520]   The course of nature, the course of life, everything.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.360]   It was a completely hopeless position.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   There was not a glimmer of hope in any respect against hope.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.520]   What did he believe in?
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.360]   Well, he believed in the hope that God laid before him.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.400]   That is what this means.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.280]   It does not just mean "who against hope believed hopefully."
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:57.360]   No, it is this, "who against hope believed in this hope that God was outlining to him."
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.520]   This future that he was painting before him, that is the hope.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.640]   The hope of the coming of the Son of God in the flesh, the hope of salvation, the hope
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.400]   of deliverance, the hope of the coming in of the Gentiles, that is the hope.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.920]   It is the great hope that runs right through the Old Testament.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.600]   Now then, what we are told is that Abraham believed in this hope, this promise, in spite
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.400]   of everything.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:30.960]   Though everything was against it, and every reasonable argument was opposed to it, and
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.480]   all common sense was dead against it, and all testimony of humanity ridiculed it, still
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.360]   Abraham believed it.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.600]   Against hope, he believed in hope.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:54.360]   That again is another very important aspect of faith, and always a real element in faith,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.960]   wherever you get it, and wherever it manifests itself.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.840]   But even that does not end the achievements of faith.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:11.960]   Point number four, his faith enabled him to have an assurance with respect to this.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.000]   Did you notice that in verse 21?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.120]   And being fully persuaded, this is Abraham, and Abraham being fully persuaded that what
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.480]   he, God had promised, he was able also to perform.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.640]   He was fully persuaded of it.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:38.200]   Or if you like another translation, he was strongly convinced of it.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:45.600]   Now I wonder whether there is anybody who is rather surprised at this statement.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:53.240]   I wonder whether we always realize that faith, true faith, always has in it this element
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.560]   of assurance, of certainty, and of confidence.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.120]   I think this needs to be emphasized at the present time.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.760]   Faith is not merely hoping against hope.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.600]   Faith is fully persuaded.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.840]   Faith is assured.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.080]   Faith is certain.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.560]   Faith is not just something that whistles in the dark to keep up its courage.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.600]   That is not faith at all.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.400]   Fully persuaded.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.920]   Now this is important, and I want to give you therefore some further statements in the
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.080]   scripture to substantiate this point.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.440]   It is not only here that we have this statement about faith.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.480]   Take for instance the classical statement of it in the epistle to the Hebrews, in the
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.800]   first verse of the eleventh chapter.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.840]   What is faith?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:51.480]   Well faith, we are told, is the substance of things hoped for.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.560]   It is the evidence of things not seen.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560]   What is faith?
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:03.040]   Well faith is the substantiating of the thing we hope for.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.680]   It is the evidencing.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.520]   There is an evidential value and element in faith.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.440]   It is the evidence of things that we do not see.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.840]   Faith if you like are the kind of title deeds, and there is a certainty about the title deeds.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.240]   In other words, we must not think of faith as something vague and uncertain and indefinite
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   and nebulous.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.600]   "No, no," says this man in writing to the Hebrews, "that is faith."
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.920]   A substantiating.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.000]   But again you see, he repeats it in the thirteenth verse of that same eleventh chapter.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.880]   Listen to it in these words.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:45.360]   He said, "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.480]   afar off, and were persuaded of them."
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.360]   Same word, persuaded of them, and embraced them.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:03.000]   Now all this means that there is this element of certainty and of assurance and of certitude
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   in faith.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.520]   Here you have got it in this chapter, there it is in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.800]   I suggest to you that it is an element in faith always in the New Testament.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.560]   And I say it is important for this reason.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:26.040]   It is this that differentiates faith from a mere intellectual belief.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:33.240]   It is this, if you like, which differentiates faith from what I have often called "believism"
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240]   or "fideism."
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:40.440]   Now, I believe I once mentioned to you here a terrible heresy that came into the Church
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:46.000]   towards the end of the eighteenth century called "Sandemanism."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   What is Sandemanism?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   It is this.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   It is a teaching which says that as long as you say that Jesus is Lord, that as long as
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.640]   you say you believe, you are saved.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.520]   But that is not right, that is heresy.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.760]   A man who does truly believe, a man who is regenerate, of course does say that he believes.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.200]   But merely to say that you believe these things is not faith.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   Faith includes this other element of certainty, of assurance, of confidence.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.920]   Faith knows there is this element of knowledge in faith, and we must never take it out of
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.440]   faith.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:35.800]   Being fully persuaded—that is Abram's faith—he was fully persuaded, and that is
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.160]   why he did what he did and acted as he did.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.400]   He was certain of the thing.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:47.880]   And I am urging that it is very important for us ever to keep this before our minds.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:55.040]   You see, if we don't, we will get what is so often to be seen, our less.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.640]   People who are forced and urged to say that they believe and accept these things, and
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.280]   are then told that they are Christians and are regarded as Christians, and then in a
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.080]   few months you hear that they are denying it all and say that there is nothing in it,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.200]   that they were just psychologically affected for the time being and that really they have
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.120]   no use for it at all.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   What was the matter there?
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.480]   Well, they never had true faith.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.160]   They said they believed.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.280]   That is not faith.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.000]   That can be purely intellectual assent.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.280]   There is nothing to prevent a man saying that if he is persuaded by the argument, he says,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.680]   "Very well, I believe that."
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.960]   He doesn't feel anything.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.080]   Faith is a big thing.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.920]   It takes in the sensations.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.160]   It takes in the heart.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.320]   It takes in the whole man.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.440]   He is fully persuaded.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.760]   And this is a very real and a very essential element in faith.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.560]   Faith, I say again, is not just hoping against hope.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.280]   It is being fully persuaded.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.960]   It is embracing because you are fully persuaded.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.000]   Very well, that brings me to the last element in this matter, the fifth thing which Abraham's
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.640]   faith enabled him to do.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.400]   And that is, of course, that in the light of all this, he acted upon it.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.480]   He believed God's word and he acted upon it.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:27.200]   Now, it is very interesting to notice how the record tells us, back in the book of Genesis,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.880]   in chapter 17 and in the fifth verse, one of the things which Abraham did.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.920]   There you will read that God said to Abraham, "Neither shall thy name any more be called
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:48.320]   Abram, but thy name shall be called Abraham, for a father of many nations have I made thee."
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.120]   And there, you see, the meaning of the words is important.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.280]   Abram, A-B-R-A-M, means "high father."
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.400]   Abraham means "father of many nations."
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.280]   Now, said God, "I'm not going to call you Abram any longer.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.160]   I'm going to call you Abraham."
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.520]   And from that moment, Abraham called himself Abraham.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.080]   He was known as Abraham.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.360]   He let everybody know that he'd got a new name.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.480]   He said, "Call me Abraham.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.560]   God has told me that I'm Abraham.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.720]   Therefore don't call me Abram any longer.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.280]   Call me Abraham."
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.120]   He acted on it.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.080]   And in other respects, as you know, in other words, for me to complete the quotation of
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:40.480]   Hebrews 11, verse 13, it reads like this, "These all died in faith, not having received
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:49.440]   the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:57.000]   and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.760]   And that's in the context of Abraham, in the 11th chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:11.080]   Abraham believed all this, and his whole life henceforward was lived on this supposition,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.880]   on this statement which God had made to him.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.360]   He became a stranger and a pilgrim.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.920]   He began looking for the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.480]   He kept his eye on this Messiah that was to come, and whatever happened to him, he held
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   on to that.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:37.520]   He acted on what he had believed, and on this thing of which he had become fully assured.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:47.320]   Now there I say are the five things which Abraham's faith enabled Abraham to do.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.480]   But still we haven't exhausted what the apostle tells us.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.560]   The next big matter that he puts before us is this.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:04.760]   How did Abraham's faith enable him to do those five things?
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.840]   It's a perfectly fair question.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:13.240]   What is it about faith, what is it in faith, that does enable a man in this way to accept
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.560]   a staggering statement on God's bare word, and to become absolutely sure of it, and to
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.360]   act on it, and to risk everything upon it?
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   How does faith do it?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.440]   Well, says the apostle, it does it in this way.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.200]   Faith is something that makes a man strong.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.120]   Now this is verse 20.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.800]   He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but, says this authorized version,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.000]   was strong in faith, giving God the glory.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.040]   A better translation is this, was made strong by faith, or was strengthened by faith, or
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.920]   in his faith.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:04.720]   Very well then I say that faith does it by making us strong, by putting vigor and power
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.520]   and strength into our whole life and our whole thinking and all our activities.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.720]   But watch at the way in which the apostle puts it.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.520]   He's so concerned about this point that he first puts it negatively, and then he puts
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.800]   it positively.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.160]   Negatively, he puts it in two ways.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:29.960]   He says in verse 19, "And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   dead when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb."
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.960]   How was he strong?
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   How was he made strong?
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.400]   Well, he was delivered from being weak.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.720]   He wasn't weak.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.560]   But here again the translation is a little bit important.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.880]   Those of you who've got the revised version in front of you will notice that there is
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:01.440]   a difference in your version from what I read out here in this 19th verse.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   I read, "And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead."
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.480]   You haven't got the word "not."
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.240]   What you've got is this.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.440]   Without being weakened in faith, he considered his own body.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.840]   The authorized version says, "He considered not his own body."
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.120]   The revised version says, "He considered his own body."
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:31.040]   And the standard revised says exactly the same thing, and it undoubtedly is right at
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.120]   this point.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.360]   The four oldest manuscripts of the New Testament have not got this negative.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.160]   They've all got it in the positive form.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:50.320]   They all say that he did consider his body, but that he was not weakened in faith because
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.840]   he considered his body and the condition of Sarah's womb.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   Now, why do I trouble to make a point like this?
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:04.440]   Well, for this good reason, because this brings out another very glorious aspect and element
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.880]   in this whole matter of faith.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.000]   You see, this translation as we have it here in the authorized might give us the impression
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.400]   that being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.280]   He didn't think of it for a moment, and he didn't consider for a second Sarah's condition.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.160]   But if you go back and read the history in the book of Genesis, you'll find that that
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.720]   isn't true.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.200]   Abram did consider it.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.120]   He spoke to himself about it.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.640]   He said, "Shall I indeed at my age be the father of a son, and shall Sarah at her age
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.820]   bear a son?"
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.640]   Read the story for yourselves.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.040]   He did consider it.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.200]   And therefore it's important that we should be quite clear about this.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.260]   Of course, in the last analysis, we could easily interpret this authorized translation
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.760]   in the same way.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.440]   Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, I could say means this.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.400]   Well, that he didn't keep on considering it and become weak.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.840]   But even that isn't good enough.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.480]   It's actually this.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.720]   Without being weakened in faith, he did consider his own body.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.240]   So it brings out this element.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.800]   Faith is not something that refuses to face the facts.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:23.320]   Now, there are some people who think of faith in that way.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:29.480]   And the result is that the man of the world says, "Ah, what you call faith I call escapism."
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.680]   And that is what the clever men of the world are saying about us tonight.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.480]   They say, "Look at those Christian people.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   What are they doing?"
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.560]   They say, "They're not realists.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.480]   They go into their little buildings, they pull down the blinds, they shut out the world
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.760]   and its problems, and they persuade themselves of certain things."
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   Wishful thinking.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   Escapism.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.720]   They don't face the facts of life.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.340]   They run away from them.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.040]   One man reads a novel, these others believe the Christian message, and they believe in
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   God and so on.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   They say it's all escapism.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.920]   It's a refusal to face the facts.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.240]   They're playing with themselves.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   They're like children.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.320]   Christianity, they say, belongs to the infancy of the human race.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.800]   It's a sort of fantasy that people work up for themselves in order to give themselves
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.220]   a little bit of comfort.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.280]   It's a kind of dream that they're trying to materialize.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.760]   They don't face the facts.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.800]   But you see, that's quite wrong.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.400]   Abraham faced the facts.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.640]   He reminded himself of his own age, as the apostle tells us here.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.960]   He reminded himself of Sarah's age.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.520]   He looked at the facts as they were, at their very worst.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.160]   And yet, though he did that, he wasn't at all weakened in his faith.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.580]   Why not?
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.800]   This is the important point.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:01.540]   Abraham did look at the facts, but he didn't stop at that.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.340]   He didn't go on looking at the facts and the difficulties and the obstacles.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:10.140]   He looked at them, but having looked at them, he looked at something else.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.240]   He looked at someone else.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.940]   Now you see, the trouble with unbelief is that it only looks at the difficulties.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.020]   It's all there, isn't it, in the famous incident of Peter walking upon the water.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.980]   As long as he looked at the Lord Jesus Christ, he could walk on the waves.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.820]   But he began to look at the waves, and he saw them boisterous, and down he went.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.820]   Why?
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.340]   Well, because he was looking at the difficulties.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.140]   He considered them in the sense that he only considered them, and considered nothing else.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.660]   That's unbelief.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.300]   Now this is a very important principle.
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:47.540]   Faith doesn't turn its back upon problems.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.300]   It's amongst them.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:54.980]   It looks at them straight in the face, and then rises above them.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.220]   Goes straight through them, if you like.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.380]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.180]   There are some people who think that because they're assailed by doubts, that they haven't
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.180]   got any faith.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.300]   That's a complete fallacy.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:17.020]   To be entirely free from doubt doesn't always signify faith.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:23.980]   That savours a little bit more of what is regarded as faith, and which is psychological.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.380]   There is a sense in which you can define faith like this, that faith is that which enables
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.780]   a man to overcome his doubts, and to answer them.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.860]   Some of the greatest saints that the Church has ever seen have testified to the fact that
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.660]   they've been attacked and assailed by doubts to the end of their lives.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.060]   But they haven't become weakened.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.060]   They haven't given in.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.500]   They have mastered them.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   They have conquered them.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.700]   They have overcome them.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.700]   That's faith.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.340]   Browning puts it in a very striking phrase, somewhere when he puts it like this.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:05.580]   To me, he says, faith means unbelief kept quiet like the snake 'neath Michael's foot.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.580]   You see the picture.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.660]   There is a man, and there's a snake that's come to attack him, and is about to bite him
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.660]   and to kill him.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.740]   He keeps his foot on that snake, and keeps the pressure of his foot down.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.980]   Faith means unbelief kept quiet like the snake 'neath Michael's foot.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:27.420]   Oh yes, this is a very important aspect of faith.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.620]   It considers the difficulties, but it overcomes them.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.820]   Though it considers the difficulties, it isn't weakened.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.420]   It still remains strong.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.500]   Oh, how important is this negative of the apostle.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   Let me just give you the other negative, and we'll leave it at that this evening.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:52.340]   The second negative is that he did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.580]   What's the difference between this and being weak, says someone?
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.820]   What does he mean by this staggering?
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.340]   Well, I think it means this.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.980]   Isn't this our experience?
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.220]   That unbelief attacks us along two lines.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.700]   The one line is the one I've just been describing.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.620]   It says, look at the facts, look at the difficulties, look at yourself, look at your weakness, look
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.780]   at your age, look at this and that.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.140]   Then when you overcome that, it does this.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.300]   It says, all right, but look at the greatness of the promise.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:27.660]   Why, they said if it were some ordinary promise, indeed if it were just a remarkable promise,
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.660]   you might believe it.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.420]   But look what God is promising to you.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.340]   Look at it, says the devil to Abraham.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.220]   Look what God is actually promising you.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.300]   All right, I'll accept what you've said about yourself, but look.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.020]   But to think that your seed is going to be like the sand on the seashore, innumerable,
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.180]   like the stars in the heaven beyond computation.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.100]   Why men, the thing is staggering, it's too good to be true.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.820]   It can't be true.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.780]   The greatness of the promise.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.300]   Hasn't that often caused us to stagger?
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.580]   Now what's the meaning of this word, to stagger?
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.780]   It's a very interesting word.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:12.140]   In its origin it means to discriminate and to judge and to estimate.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.420]   But then it goes beyond that.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:21.780]   It means this, that a man begins to argue with himself and to be at variance with himself.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.380]   There is that within him which says, believe that.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.480]   Ah, says the other, wait a minute.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.900]   And the argument begins.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.780]   He's at variance with himself.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.820]   An element in him says, faith says, believe it.
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.180]   And the reason comes in and says, but can you believe that?
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.380]   It's too good to be true.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.900]   It's too big, it's too vast.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   And there he is arguing with himself, at variance with himself.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.740]   And instead of walking, he's staggering.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.900]   He's going backwards and forwards at the same time, and going from side to side as he's
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   going forward.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.320]   He's staggering.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.900]   He believes and he doesn't believe.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.380]   I believe, help thou my non-belief.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.380]   That's staggering.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:01.340]   Or he's like the men that James describes, who's unstable in all his ways.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.940]   The men who lacks wisdom, you see.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.580]   He's like the wave of the sea.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.820]   There's no stability there.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:13.740]   He's staggering, doubting, wavering, hesitating.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:21.380]   And what we are told here by the apostle about Abram's faith was that it was so great that
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.260]   he didn't stagger.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.780]   It was not only not weak, he didn't stagger.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.140]   He held firmly erect, upright.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.840]   He went on walking.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:41.740]   He didn't stagger because of the greatness of the promise.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:47.600]   Well, our time unfortunately has gone and I say we've got to leave it at that this evening.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.220]   But let's see where we've arrived at.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:56.780]   Faith, this amazing thing, has enabled Abram and all others to do these five things.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.700]   And it does it by making us strong.
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.620]   It prevents our being weak.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.900]   It prevents our staggering.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.340]   Don't forget the negatives, how tremendously important they are.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:13.780]   I trust that someone who may be in this congregation has been helped this evening.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.220]   The devil had persuaded you that because doubts come to you, that you've never had faith,
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.300]   oh, the devil will see to it that doubts will come to you.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.740]   These are the fiery darts that he throws at us.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.420]   But if you hold up the shield of faith, they'll all be quenched.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:34.140]   So don't confuse between temptation and sin.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.340]   Don't confuse between the doubts that are hurled at you and unbelief.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.060]   The question is what do you do with them?
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.060]   They will come.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.060]   Abram considered.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:49.140]   But though he considered, he wasn't weak, he wasn't weakened.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:57.420]   And though he looked at the staggering promise, he did not stagger.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.860]   Thank God for the negatives.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:05.320]   Next Sunday, God willing, next Friday, God willing, we'll go on to look at the positive
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:10.500]   element which the apostle again brings out in all its glory.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.500]   Let us pray.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:20.860]   Oh Lord, our God, we thank Thee for faith.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:26.900]   By grace are we saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.380]   Oh Lord, we thank Thee for it.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:38.540]   We thank Thee for the greatness of faith, for that which it accomplishes, and that Thou
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:45.980]   hast appointed it as the instrument of our justification and reconciliation, and our
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.780]   being righteous in Thy most holy sight.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:58.220]   Oh God, receive our humble prayers, and open our eyes, we pray Thee, more and more, to
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.660]   see the glories of faith, to exercise it.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:07.460]   Forgive us, oh Lord, if any of us have become weakened through looking at ourselves, our
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.940]   difficulties, our problems.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:14.740]   Forgive us if we are staggering as we look at the greatness of Thine exceeding great
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.300]   and precious promises.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:25.580]   Oh Lord, grant unto us this faith that will enable us ever to continue steadfast, fully
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.380]   persuaded, knowing that it is true.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:37.220]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship in
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:44.540]   the communion of the Holy Spirit, abide and continue with us, now this night, throughout
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:55.460]   the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.740]   Amen.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.660]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
