[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Well, there's never a shortage of questions about our delight in God in relationship to
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080]   the gifts that he gives us.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.120]   It was only two months into the life of this podcast, we addressed the question, "How
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.120]   do I know if I love the gifts more than the giver?"
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.320]   That was APJ 55, episode number 55.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.440]   We're back on the theme exactly eight years later with a related question from a listener
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.320]   named Robert in Fairbanks, Alaska.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you so much for your faithful ministry.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.200]   I've heard you talk about the importance of loving God more than the gifts that God gives
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   us.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.800]   I believe the spirit of that statement is certainly true, but it doesn't explain everything
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   I see in the Bible.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   Particularly, how does this square with Psalm 103 verses 1 to 5, which seems to suggest
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.200]   that we love God more because of the benefits?
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.080]   Pastor John, can we diminish God's glory by being too unconcerned with inventorying
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   the gifts he has given us?"
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.520]   I'll start with the conclusion and then try to back it up.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.520]   Conclusion.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.800]   It is not inconsistent.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:21.880]   Indeed, it is crucial that we both love God more than we love his gifts and that we love
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.200]   God more because of his gifts.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200]   That's the conclusion.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.080]   And I'm saying, "Amen, amen, Robert."
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   So I am agreeing with Robert's suggestion that God's gifts may not just compete with
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:51.760]   our love for God, which they certainly can and do, but they also deepen and intensify
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.320]   our love for God himself.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I agree with the flip side, which Robert also suggests, namely, that we can diminish
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.520]   God's glory by being unconcerned, to use his phrase, with inventorying God's gifts.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:23.240]   He gets that idea rightly from Psalm 103 verses 1 to 5, which indeed does inventory at least
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.660]   five of God's gifts, maybe six, depending on how you count them.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.600]   But here's what Psalm 103 says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.640]   me, bless his holy name."
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.600]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who, one, forgives all your
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.400]   iniquity, who, two, heals all your diseases, who, three, redeems your life from the pit,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.520]   who, four, crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who, five, satisfies you with good
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.960]   so that, six, your youth is renewed like the eagles.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.680]   Now, that's amazing.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   He's so right.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.520]   That's an inventory of some of God's countless gifts to the psalmist.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   Let's notice three things from this passage, these five verses.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   First, we are indirectly commanded not to forget the benefits of God, both the spiritual
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.900]   gifts and the natural gifts.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.960]   He commands his own soul.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   He says, "Soul, don't forget all God's benefits."
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.120]   So Robert is right to insist, "Inventory them.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   Do that.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   It's a duty.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.040]   It's a divine expectation.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.200]   Don't be neglectful in your affections or in your thanksgiving of God's countless good
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   gifts."
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.960]   Here's the second thing to notice from these verses, and I mentioned it, but I'll stress
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.440]   it.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.300]   They are both spiritual and natural.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.840]   So he forgives all our iniquity.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.400]   That's a spiritual work of God.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.200]   And then it says, "He heals your diseases."
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.160]   That's a miracle to be sure, but it's a miracle that shows itself up in a very natural thing,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   like I got well.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.880]   I got well.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.320]   And so both kinds of blessings are lavished upon us, and both kinds are to be remembered.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.400]   As I was preparing and thinking about this, Tony, I couldn't help but think, this is one
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:54.000]   of the best arguments in the Bible for keeping a journal, because I've been rereading recently
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.640]   some of my journal entries from 40 years ago when I was in Germany as a grad student.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.040]   I'm sitting there in my chair downstairs loving God.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.600]   I'm just thanking Him and loving Him because of how sweetly faithful He was to Noel and
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   me.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.320]   And what we were doing in those days.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.560]   I mean, it was just, He came through for us over and over again.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.880]   Well, anyway, that's a little side note.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   If you're going to obey the command, don't forget the benefits of God.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.240]   How are you going to do that?
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.200]   And one way would be keep a journal.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:42.160]   Now the biblical pattern of remembering the mercies of God in Psalm 103, that's not isolated.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.320]   Psalm 77, 11, "I will remember the deeds of the Lord."
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.920]   Psalm 105, verse 5, "Remember the wondrous works He has done, His miracles and the judgments
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   He uttered."
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.240]   Psalm 143, verse 5, "I remember the days of old.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.440]   I meditate on all that you have done.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.120]   I ponder the work of your hands."
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.680]   And then there's a warning about the opposite.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:18.840]   Psalm 106, verse 7, "Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   works.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:28.200]   They did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but they rebelled by the sea
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.480]   at the Red Sea."
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.240]   So those are two things to notice in Psalm 103.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.820]   One, that we're commanded not to forget the gifts of God, and two, that His gifts are
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.080]   both spiritual and natural.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.860]   Now here's the third thing that I think may be the most important thing to notice in those
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.980]   five verses in Psalm 103.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:06.200]   What do the blessings, the gifts, five or six of them, what do those gifts of God—the
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.080]   gifts of God—do in the heart of the psalmist?
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.880]   What do they actually do?
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.380]   And here's the answer.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:20.260]   They cause the psalmist to praise God.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.600]   Not to praise the gifts, though they are beautiful, wonderful, great, glorious, satisfying, oh,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.320]   how wonderful to be healed and to be forgiven.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   Here's what he says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.060]   Bless His holy name.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.200]   Bless the Lord, O my soul."
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:53.080]   Now this gets at what Robert was saying when he says that we diminish God's glory by neglecting
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.080]   the inventory of His gifts.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.200]   That's right.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:06.660]   The psalmist shows both of those insights because he clearly is giving God glory because
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.200]   of the gifts, not in spite of the gifts, and this is clearly coming from his heart, a heart
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.520]   of love, his soul.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.360]   "Bless the Lord, O my soul."
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:24.680]   His soul is being stirred up for God by God's gifts.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:36.800]   So why would I even mention, let alone emphasize, that his gifts are dangerous, that they might
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.000]   lure us away from God?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.760]   Well, first, because that's what we see happening to millions and millions of people every single
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.960]   day.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.840]   They take God's gifts from God's hands and feel nothing for God.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.440]   It's called idolatry.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:08.600]   And second, because texts like Philippians 3.8 say, "I count everything as loss, everything
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.440]   as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:20.640]   For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.880]   that I might gain Christ."
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   So how in the world do we put that together?
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.040]   We put it together like this.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   When Paul views the healing of his diseases, for example, as a competitor with Christ,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:46.880]   if he views the healing of a disease as a competitor with Christ in his affections,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.840]   that is, if he sees it as a rising temptation to love health and life more than he loves
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.360]   Christ, he counts it as rubbish.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.960]   And that's how he fights for genuine faith.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.000]   By comparison to Christ, they are rubbish.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.160]   He preaches that to himself and he counts them as rubbish so that Christ remains Christ,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.360]   God, treasure in his life.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.080]   And I would say to all of us, test your heart to see if you can say that.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.280]   Can you say in comparison to Christ, all is rubbish?
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.360]   If I must choose, I choose Christ.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:32.440]   But when he views the healing of his diseases as a blessing from God and for the glory of
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:39.320]   God and for the advancement of God's saving purposes in the world, Paul will soar with
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.480]   the psalmist, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and don't forget any of his benefits."
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.160]   He does it at the beginning of almost every letter he writes, right?
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:55.080]   He just erupts with thanksgiving for the gifts of God's people.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:03.520]   So here's a test case that we can all use to discern whether the gifts of God are having
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.560]   the wrong effects on our souls.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:15.320]   The test is in Psalm 40, verse 16, and Psalm 70, verse 4, and the tests go like this.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:25.400]   Psalm 40, "May those who love your salvation say continually, 'Great is the Lord.'"
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.680]   Not "Great is the gift."
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:38.720]   Or Psalm 70, "May those who love your salvation say evermore, 'God is great.'"
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.040]   Is that the effect?
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.240]   I'm asking, is that the effect that the gifts of God have on you?
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:56.080]   Do they cause you, me, to feel and to say, "Great is the Lord.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.200]   God is great."
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   That's the test.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.880]   So thank you, Robert, for pressing in on this.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.360]   I think you're absolutely right, and I'm glad for the clarification conclusion.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:21.560]   We love God more than we love his gifts, and we love God more because of his gifts.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   Love that principle.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   Pithy, memorable.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.840]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.480]   And if you want to hear more from Pastor John on the practice of journaling that he mentioned
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:36.360]   earlier, see our archived episodes, particularly APJ 409 and APJ 1262.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.880]   Those are two episodes that you will find an explanation for why and how Pastor John
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   journals.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.920]   You'll find them at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.200]   Those are episodes 409 and 1262.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.720]   Well, how can we find mission and live on mission?
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's one of the keys to walking by faith in this life, and we're going to address it next
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.400]   time when we return on Wednesday.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:01.720]   We'll see you then.
