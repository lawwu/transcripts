[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.320]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 4, reading from verse 27 to verse 30.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.720]   And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.320]   Yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.760]   The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.800]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.240]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.520]   Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.040]   We are particularly concerned at the moment with the 29th verse.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.480]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.600]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   These words, you remember, were spoken by the woman of Samaria to her fellow countrymen
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.800]   and fellow townsmen.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.720]   And she does this as the result of the conversation between the Lord Jesus Christ and herself,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.080]   which is recorded in the earlier part of this particular chapter.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.040]   Now here we are dealing with her response to our Lord and to what he had been saying
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   to her.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640]   And we are studying it for one reason only.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.420]   Here is a woman who has been led by our Lord to understand the very essence and center
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.160]   of the Christian faith.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.400]   It is to her that he has uttered those most wonderful words, contrasting the water of
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.920]   the well by which they were speaking with the water that he has to give.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.400]   He says, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.800]   But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.720]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.320]   everlasting life."
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.800]   Now that's Christianity.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.440]   That is what is meant by being a Christian, that you have within you this well of water
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.200]   springing up into everlasting life.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.400]   And we are concerned about this whole incident because we are anxious to see what it is that
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:32.040]   hinders so many from knowing this final satisfaction, this sufficiency that our Lord has to give.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.880]   And it is as we obtain instruction from the case of this woman in that respect that we
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.520]   are considering the entire story.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:49.400]   Now I'm emphasizing at the moment this remarkably interesting thing, that when the woman leaves
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.320]   our Lord and the disciples have just come back from buying provisions and rushes to
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.880]   the city to tell them about him, the first thing she says is, "Come see a man which
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.720]   told me all things that ever I did."
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.320]   Now this, I suggested last Sunday morning, is a very remarkable thing.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.440]   Would you have anticipated that?
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   Wouldn't you rather have expected her to talk about him and to describe him and his
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.640]   personality and so on, as people do today with this cult of personality?
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.680]   But you see she doesn't do that.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.920]   The first thing she mentions, the thing that obviously is deepest in her mind and heart
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.960]   is that here is one who has told her all the truth about herself.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.080]   A man who has told me all things that ever I did.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   It's hyperbole.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.680]   He hadn't literally in detail told her everything she'd ever done, but what she's saying is,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   "Here's a man who knows all about me.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.200]   He's told me about my immoral life, that I've had five husbands, and that the man with whom
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.760]   I'm now living is not my husband, but he knows all about me.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.440]   Everything is naked and open to his eye."
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.560]   She's convicted of sin.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.040]   And what therefore we are trying to show is this, that this conviction of sin is always
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   something that is essential to a true receiving of this well of water that springs up into
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   everlasting life.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   Or if you prefer it, take it as it's put in the 16th verse of the first chapter of this
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.920]   gospel, "Of his fullness," says John, "of his fullness, of all we receive, and grace
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.200]   upon added to grace."
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.720]   Now I say again, that is Christianity.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.440]   This is what is offered us.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.320]   And the question is, are we receiving of this?
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.840]   More and more, are we growing, are we developing?
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   Are we taking increasingly of this never-ending fullness?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.880]   Now one of the things that is essential to it is this conviction of sin.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.720]   This is the first thing this woman mentions.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.160]   It's all right, it's quite true that perhaps she didn't understand it fully.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   Of course she didn't.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.040]   We go on in our understanding of that, but at any rate it's the thing with which she
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   starts.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   And what I'm trying to show at the moment is that there are so many who are lacking
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.760]   in this knowledge of this fullness that he has come to give us, because they know very
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.440]   little about conviction of sin.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.320]   I venture to suggest on Sunday morning that if I were asked to say what, above everything
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.400]   else as I see things, is the real explanation of the state of the church today, and I mean
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   the evangelical church as well, as more general, I would without any hesitation say that this
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.480]   is the answer.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.160]   There is an absence of conviction of sin.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.880]   There is an absence of humility.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.080]   There is an absence of the fear of the Lord.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.520]   We are too healthy.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.720]   We are too bright, self-contained, trusting to ourselves and our efforts and organizations.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.760]   There is a lack of this which we see so clearly in this woman, and which I'm trying to show
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.240]   is something that is found everywhere right through the biblical teaching.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.960]   Now I've given you some reasons already for emphasizing this and putting it in this
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.880]   first position.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.280]   I suggested it was the one thing that shows us the difference between the cults and the
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.880]   true Christian faith.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.520]   The cults never produce conviction of sin, never.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   This always does.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.800]   Secondly, I pointed out that it is the difference between taking up religion and becoming truly
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   Christian.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.640]   You know, you and I can take up religion as people take up other religions, but the real
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.280]   difference between taking up religion and even being active in it perhaps, and being
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   truly Christian is that the true Christian knows conviction of sin and sorrow for sin
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.240]   in a way that the other person never does.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.520]   And then I suggested thirdly last Sunday morning that we must put this first because it's
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   the thing that always comes first in the New Testament itself.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.160]   John the Baptist, the first preacher, baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.400]   He's the forerunner.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.960]   He prepares the way for the Lord.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.080]   The law always comes before the gospel, and the law convicts.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.080]   Very well.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.800]   Well now, but there are further reasons, and I want to consider them with you.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.560]   Have you ever looked at it from this standpoint?
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.440]   Read these four gospels, and at once you'll be impressed by the opposition which our Lord
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.760]   met and received.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.920]   It's one of the most extraordinary things, that he, the Son of God who'd come to bless
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.840]   mankind should have had this opposition.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.280]   How much space is given up in these gospels to the recording of the wranglings of the
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.560]   Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the law and all these other people.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   Why did they object to him?
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.600]   What was it they objected to?
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.920]   And I think you'll agree that the answer is quite simple.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.880]   What they objected to always was that he convicted them of their sin.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.440]   This was the great trouble, especially with the Pharisees.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.080]   Our Lord's teaching made the Pharisees feel that they were sinners.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   And of course, they hated that.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.880]   It cut right across all their ideas.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.360]   They divided themselves up into Pharisees and sinners.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.920]   The publicans were the sinners, of course, but they're the Pharisees, the godly, the
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   self-righteous.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.280]   You see it all in that parable of our Lord's of the Pharisee and the publican that went
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.840]   up into the temple to pray.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.440]   There it is to perfection.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.040]   But you see, his teaching convicted them of sin.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.680]   And they hated him because of it.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.000]   They couldn't tolerate this.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.400]   And he finally crucified him, simply because he made them feel that they were sinners.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   Indeed, he not only made them feel it in general by the general tenor of his teaching, he puts
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.440]   it specifically to them.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.400]   And he puts it like this.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.160]   I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   He says, all right, you reject my gospel, you say it isn't for you, very well, I came
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.280]   not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.920]   They that are holy, he says, have no need of a physician.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.080]   But they that are sick.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.600]   Now that's simply telling them very plainly and very directly that they are putting themselves
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.360]   outside the salvation that he has come to give.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.680]   But perhaps one of his clearest statements of all is at the end of the ninth chapter
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.280]   of this gospel according to St. John, the last paragraph, Jesus said, "For judgment
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.320]   I am come into this world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320]   might be made blind."
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him, "Are
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   we blind also?"
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   That's it.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.040]   "Are you saying that we are blind?"
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.840]   Jesus said unto them, "If ye were blind ye should have no sin.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.880]   But now you say, we see.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.240]   Therefore, you are sin remaineth."
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:32.480]   And this was, as I say, the explanation of this constant argumentation and wrangling
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.400]   of these Pharisees and scribes against our Lord.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.200]   So you see, it was obviously the thing that stood out prominently in his teaching.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.240]   They saw it negatively and they reacted against it, but thereby they are giving proof that
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.200]   it is the first thing that he always does.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.880]   He convicts of sin.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.120]   This woman sees it.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.640]   The Pharisees felt it, but they hated it.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.960]   So we must put this in the first position, or if you prefer it, take it in the way in
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.840]   which the Apostle puts it in that bit of writing which we read at the beginning, the seventh
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.360]   chapter of his epistle to the Romans.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.040]   Here's the whole trouble, you see.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.560]   Saul of Tarsus was a man who was very satisfied with himself.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.960]   And he, as a Pharisee, he resented this particular teaching.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.560]   And he puts it like this, he says, "I was alive without the law once."
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.000]   He thought he was all right.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.960]   He was perfectly satisfied.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.000]   But then he suddenly realized the meaning of the law.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.220]   You can know the law in the letter.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.520]   You can be very expert on it, looking at it purely in an external manner, and you'll
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.200]   say, "Well, as judging the righteousness which is of the law, I am blameless."
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.600]   And that was his position.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.160]   You take with this the third chapter of his epistle to the Philippians, and especially
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.880]   verses four to six.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.200]   And there you find he gives this list of all his righteousness, and how pleased he was
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:16.160]   with himself as a religious, moral man, an expert in the law, and so on.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.720]   But then suddenly the Spirit comes upon him and upon the law.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.120]   And he sees it all.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.080]   "I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came," what he means by
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.240]   that is, "when the Spirit came upon it and came upon me, then it really did get me, it
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   came to me.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.640]   Sin revived and I died."
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.560]   He saw that he was the chief of sinners.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.040]   And that's what he says about himself.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.000]   It is a faithful saying, "And worthy of all expectation that Christ Jesus came into
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.960]   the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief."
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.240]   See, that's the difference between the religious men and the Christian men.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.360]   The religious man is not aware that he's a sinner at all.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.120]   The publicans are sinners, of course, but he's not.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.840]   And the thing that shows us the difference, and the thing that determines whether a man
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.560]   is just religious, and has taken up religion, and whether he's truly a Christian, is that
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.400]   the commandment comes with the enlightenment of the Spirit, and we are convicted, and we
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.920]   are undone.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.360]   So he goes on, you see, "Was then that which is good made death unto me?
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.600]   God forbid!
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.040]   But sin that it might appear, sin, working death in me by that which is good, that sin
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.720]   by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.400]   For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin."
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.440]   That's it.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.480]   You see, as a Pharisee, it is the last thing he would ever have said.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.200]   But the moment conviction comes, this is what he finds, and he's ready to admit it.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:00.480]   And so he goes on with this analysis, ending with the final cry, "O wretched men that
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.740]   I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.200]   So you see, it is obvious that this is the thing that always comes out first and most
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.120]   prominently in the whole of our Lord's ministry.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:22.120]   And the reaction of the self-righteous Pharisee to it, and of the religious person to it,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.240]   is a proof of the fact that without this there is no such thing as becoming Christian.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.320]   Very well, there's another way of looking at it.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:40.600]   But you know, even apart from his teaching, isn't it interesting to observe how his
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:51.360]   very presence, his person, and all that he was, so often produced this same effect upon
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.800]   people, even at times without his saying a single word.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.080]   And this is something, of course, which, as I say, is found running right through the
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.840]   whole Bible.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:15.680]   You see, what we are concerned about is our relationship to God.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.040]   And this is not something intellectual, this is something personal.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.520]   And so there is this great emphasis always in the Bible.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.320]   There are people who believe in God, who have always believed in God, always brought up
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.360]   to believe in God, but that's how they say it.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.960]   And thereby they betray themselves.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   People argue about God.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.520]   That's what God should do and shouldn't do, and so on.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.080]   You see, but that's not the atmosphere of the Bible at all.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.520]   It's something which is entirely different.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.680]   Now let me give you just one or two examples of what I mean.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.920]   You see, it's one thing to believe intellectually, but the man who only believes intellectually,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.120]   he knows very little about the well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.520]   He knows nothing practically about this fullness that is in him.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   The moment you're in that realm, there's a change in the whole demeanor, the whole
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.520]   attitude.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.760]   Now there's a perfect example of this in the case of Jacob.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.600]   Jacob, of course, had been brought up to believe in God.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.280]   He was a religious man.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   And you know the kind of life that he was living.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.160]   But you see, the thing that in a way changed this man's whole life, and he never forgot
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.920]   it, was that experience that he had that day that he was running away from the wrath of
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920]   his brother Esau.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.480]   He'd supplanted him and got his blessing, and he's running away.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.840]   His mother has suggested to him he'd better go if he wants to save his life, and off he
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   goes.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.280]   And he's traveled and he's been running and he's weary and tired, and he puts himself
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:00.560]   down to sleep, and he puts a stone under his head as a pillow, and there he has this extraordinary
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   dream.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:07.200]   And then he wakes up, and this is what I read, Genesis 28, 16.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:14.000]   Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.200]   it not."
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:23.720]   And he was afraid and said, "How dreadful is this place.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:29.560]   This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   That's it.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.160]   You see, he's a man who believes in God, and he goes to sleep, he doesn't think, but something
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.440]   happens.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.600]   And he has an experience, a direct, immediate experience of God, and he says, "Surely the
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.280]   Lord is in this place, and I knew it not."
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.120]   And the effect upon him is that he was afraid.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.320]   And he said, "How dreadful is this place.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.800]   It's none other than the house of God.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.600]   It's the very gateway of heaven."
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.480]   And so you get many another example.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:07.640]   You remember when Moses had finished erecting the tabernacle in the wilderness for the people
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.280]   and furnished it perfectly, everything was in position and everything was all right.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:18.320]   Then suddenly the glory of the Lord descended upon it all, and Moses, we are told, couldn't
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.600]   enter into the tabernacle because of the glory.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.120]   This is the thing that is emphasized right away through the Bible.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.920]   You remember the same thing happens to Isaiah.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.240]   It's a part of the very call of this man.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.520]   It's a part of his commissioning.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   He gets his vision.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   It's in the sixth chapter.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:45.720]   In the year that King Isaiah died, I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.280]   lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.000]   Above it stood the seraphims, each one of six wings.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.360]   With twain he covered his face, with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   fly.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:05.160]   And one cried unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.600]   The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.520]   And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.400]   with smoke.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.880]   This is a wonderful vision given to Isaiah.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   What's its effect?
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:34.520]   Then said I, "Woe is me, woe is me, for I am undone, for I am a man of unclean lips,
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.640]   and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:46.960]   For mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.000]   You see the effect of having a vision of God?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.480]   You see the result of coming anywhere near the presence of God?
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   He hasn't seen God, for no man can see God and live.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:07.240]   But he's had a vision, he's had a glimpse, and this is the immediate effect.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.840]   It is the invariable effect.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:18.960]   "Woe is me, for I am undone, I am a man of unclean lips."
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.800]   There was no condemnation that came from the throne of God to Isaiah.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.640]   The law wasn't thundered at him.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.440]   He wasn't condemned in detail.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.760]   There's no need to.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:37.280]   We come into the presence of God, there's no defense, no self-defense.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.080]   He sees the truth about himself, he's undone, he's a man of unclean lips, and he dwells
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.720]   in the midst of a people of unclean lips.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:55.000]   Now my dear friends, all I am suggesting to you is this.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.360]   We are not mere believers in God with our minds and intellects.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.320]   We claim to know him, and we are his people.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.760]   That is impossible without our knowing something of what Isaiah felt on that occasion.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.120]   I agree, that's an exceptional experience, yes, but it is only an exceptional experience
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.240]   to indicate what is the norm.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.000]   This is where we are supposed to be and to come, but let's go on.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.160]   There it is in the Old Testament teaching.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.720]   Come along to the New Testament teaching.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.680]   And here I say one is struck so constantly as one reads the Gospels, by the way in which
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:42.480]   our Lord himself had this effect upon people, especially at moments when he had worked a
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.800]   miracle or had done something unusual and remarkable.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.240]   Watch every time you read of the miracles, watch the effect upon the disciples and upon
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   the people.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:01.160]   A sense of marvel, a sense of amazement, or you read that they worshipped God for this
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.960]   strange power that he'd given unto men.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.240]   But one of the most interesting occasions of all is in the case of Peter.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.840]   You remember they'd been out fishing and had caught nothing, and then our Lord appears
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.880]   and tells them to throw the net on the other side, and they caught so many that the net
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.120]   broke, it's in the fifth chapter of Luke's Gospel.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.520]   And what's interesting is to read the effect that that had upon Peter.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.840]   This is what happened when they got the boat back to land again with this tremendous haul
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.600]   of fish after a night of failure.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.760]   The effect upon Peter of all people was he went to our Lord and he said, "Depart from
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.080]   me for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.400]   Why did he feel that?
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.520]   Our Lord hadn't chastised him, our Lord hadn't rebuked him, our Lord hadn't said that he
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.840]   was a sinner, our Lord hadn't read out a list to him of his particular sins.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   No, no.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.040]   Our Lord had just given the word, "Throw the net on the other side and you'll catch,"
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.160]   and they did.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.600]   But the effect upon Peter is to make him feel that he's a sinner, that he can't stand
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   it in a sense.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.160]   "Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   What is it?
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.000]   Oh, he just had a glimpse of this glory of the Son of God and the power of the infinite
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   and the eternal.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.120]   And whenever one has that, it always has this effect.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.880]   "Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did."
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.920]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:37.760]   Now here, you see, is obviously something that it is at the very heart and center of
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.960]   the whole of the teaching in the Bible concerning our relationship to God.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:50.480]   And how can we say that we know God if we know nothing about this kind of thing?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:56.080]   This seems to me to be the thing, as I say, that is so lacking at the present time.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   You see, we are subjective, we are self-centered, and we want blessings, and we do this and
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.440]   that, and God is forgotten.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.840]   And the thing that comes first, namely the sense of awe and of reverence and a sense
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.080]   of sinfulness and unworthiness and of vileness, doesn't seem to be there.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.560]   But our Lord, I say, constantly had this effect.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.280]   Read this again towards the end.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.120]   It's in the 18th chapter of this Gospel according to St. John.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.040]   It's the account of his arrest.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.960]   And we are told that Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place where he was.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.680]   And Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.320]   Pharisees, cometh hither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.760]   Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and said unto them,
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.000]   Whom seek ye?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.920]   They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.360]   Jesus saith unto them, I am he.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.040]   And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:07.640]   And as soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   ground.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.560]   They didn't rush forward to arrest him.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.120]   They went backward and fell to the ground.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.800]   And all he said is, I am he.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.720]   The thing he'd said to this woman of Samaria, I that speak unto thee, am he.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.160]   And he says, I am he.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.920]   And they fall back and they fall to the ground.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:36.440]   Why, oh, they suddenly realize and feel something of the truth of this statement, that he is
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:42.920]   indeed not only Jesus of Nazareth, but the everlasting Son of God.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.440]   They're in the presence of his majesty.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.920]   And they're humbled and they're alarmed and they fall down.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   Now here it is, I say.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.800]   And you get it, you see.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.760]   Subsequently to his resurrection and to his ascension, John tells us in the first chapter
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:10.160]   of the book of Revelation, how he was given this vision of this blessed risen Lord in
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.200]   the midst of the seven candlesticks.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.720]   He saw one like unto the Son of men, clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.240]   with the paps with a golden girdle.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.320]   His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.640]   of fire, and his feet like unto brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.960]   as the sound of many waters.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.200]   And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:44.320]   sword, and his countenance was as the sun's silence in his strength.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   Listen.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:54.000]   "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.760]   It's the glory, my friends.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.920]   It's the glory of God.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.320]   And Paul says, you remember, that this is the truth about a Christian.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.280]   "God that commended the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:17.120]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.880]   That's what makes me a Christian, says Paul.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.760]   I've received this treasure in an earthen vessel, but that's what I've received.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.040]   The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:39.280]   And the effect of that invariably is to humble, to subdue, to silence, to commit, to reveal
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   to us our true state and condition, our emptiness and awe, our sinfulness, our unworthiness.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.440]   You can't be healthy in his presence.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.520]   You can't be self-satisfied and glib and slick.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.520]   It's impossible.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:28:00.080]   And my dear friends, you and I, we are not people merely who believe a number of propositions
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.080]   with our intellects.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   We do that.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.880]   But you see, what makes us truly Christian is that we know something of him, that there
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.640]   is this personal fellowship and communion.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.280]   And the moment this comes in, this is the effect.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.840]   I fell down as one dead.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.760]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.960]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.400]   You see, there it is.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:32.200]   Quite apart from his explicit teaching, his very person, his very presence does it.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.600]   You get this in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.800]   But come, let's go on.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:46.280]   This is always, also, isn't it, the primary work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.760]   Our Lord has returned to heaven, and he's seated at the right hand of God in the glory
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.760]   everlasting.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:58.920]   But he said to his followers, "Let not your heart be troubled, don't be distressed.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.680]   I will send you another comforter.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.360]   I'm not going to leave you orphans.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.520]   I'll send you another teacher.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.400]   I'll send you another who'll stand by your side.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.120]   He'll be with you, he'll lead you, guide you into all truth, he'll instruct you.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.920]   It's expedient for you that I go away.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.320]   It's better for you.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.280]   You'll be in a better position after I've gone than you are now.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.360]   It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the comforter will not come
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   unto you.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.000]   But if I go away, I will send him unto you."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And he did.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.480]   Well now, what is the work of this comforter, the Holy Spirit?
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.680]   There's no difficulty, is there?
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.560]   It's especially clear in this gospel according to Saint John.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.880]   This is how our Lord himself teaches them about it.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.640]   "I tell you the truth," he says, "it is expedient for you that I go away," and so on.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.320]   And when he has come, what will he do?
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.680]   What is the first work of the Holy Spirit?
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:01.600]   He will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.640]   Of sin, because they believe not on me.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.540]   Of righteousness, because I go to my Father and he see me no more.
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:13.160]   Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:23.920]   He will convince, he will convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:30.760]   Now, this you see, according to our Lord, is to be the primary and first essential work
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.480]   of the Spirit.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.160]   The Spirit who is now in the church.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.720]   The Spirit who is now the teacher.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.780]   The one through whom the Lord, the risen Lord himself is working and acting amongst his
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.800]   people and through them to those who are outside.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.640]   This, he says, to be the primary work, the thing that's going to characterize his ministry.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.680]   Conviction of sin.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.440]   And as our Lord prophesied that, so it turned out to be.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.680]   In the second chapter of the book of Acts, you remember, we have the great account of
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:12.960]   the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the church in a mighty baptism of power on the day of
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.680]   Pentecost in Jerusalem.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.400]   And filled with this tremendous power of the Spirit to preach and expound, the apostle
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.760]   Peter stands up and he expounds the Scriptures.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.200]   He preaches the first sermon in a sense under the auspices of the Christian churches we
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.360]   now know.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.400]   What effect did this have?
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.240]   It's no longer Peter, it's Peter filled with the Spirit.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.360]   It's Peter being clothed with the Spirit.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.440]   Peter as the vehicle of the Spirit and his power.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.320]   What does the Spirit do through Peter?
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.560]   You remember the answer when they heard this.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.000]   They were pricked in their heart and said, and to Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.320]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   What's this?
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.880]   Well, this is conviction.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   You see, they're in trouble.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   They're unhappy.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   They're ill at ease.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   These people are made to feel desperate.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:12.680]   The law has come, it's found them.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.440]   And they cry out in their agony, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   Peter says, "Repent."
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.680]   In a sense he says, "Go on, let it work in you.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.520]   Go on, don't defend yourselves.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.200]   Give in to what you're feeling.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.440]   You see how wrong you've been and how unworthy you are.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440]   Let it go on.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   Don't resist the Spirit.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.880]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.880]   of sins.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.080]   And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:49.040]   But there it is, you see, the very first instance of the operation and the power of the Spirit
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   in the church.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.960]   It does the very thing which our Lord prophesied that he would do.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.120]   And as you go on, you work your way through the book of Acts, you'll find it everywhere.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:05.360]   Take the ninth chapter, Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:11.000]   The conviction, the proud, defiant Pharisee who hates Christ and is going down to exterminate
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.520]   his church and people in Damascus.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   Suddenly he sees him and he falls to the ground and he, in his helplessness, says, "What
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.920]   wilt thou have me to do, Lord?"
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.520]   He's finished.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:32.680]   He sees his utter vileness and emptiness, his woe, his utter wrongness.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.200]   And go on, you'll find the same thing everywhere.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.560]   Take the famous case of the Philippian jailer.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:45.720]   Here is a man who has carried out his instructions and he's thrust Paul and Silas into the
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.560]   innermost part of the prison, put their feet fast in the stocks, he'd already scourged
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   them.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:57.840]   And then you remember Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises unto God at midnight,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.160]   and suddenly there's a tremendous earthquake.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.280]   This man wakes up, the keeper of the prison wakes up thinking all the prisoners have fled.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.440]   But Paul cries with a loud voice unto him, saying, "Do thyself no harm."
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.760]   He was on the verge of committing suicide.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   "Do thyself no harm.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.080]   We are all here."
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.720]   What effect did that have upon the Philippian jailer?
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:22.640]   Well, you see, these records, they're so wonderful in their details.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.940]   It's all here perfectly simple and plain before us.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:31.020]   He called for the light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.020]   Silas.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.680]   What if the keeper of the prison falls down before prisoners?
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.740]   The men whom he's just been scourging, the men whom he's put into the innermost prison,
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.580]   making their feet fast in the stocks.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.540]   He falls down before them.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.100]   What's the matter with these men?
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:56.140]   And then he goes and says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.220]   But they haven't preached to him.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.700]   They haven't condemned him.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.680]   They haven't tried to convict him of anything.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   What is it?
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.740]   Oh, this man has sensed the presence of God and he's convicted of sin.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.260]   He doesn't mean, "What must I do to retain my job?
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.340]   What must I do to get myself saved?
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.420]   What must I do to be like you are?
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.780]   Where can I get this joy you've got that makes you sing in the innermost prison with your
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.780]   feet in the stocks?
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.060]   You're happier than I am as the keeper.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.060]   What is this?"
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.060]   He felt his sinfulness.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.060]   He's convicted.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.340]   The earthquake and these men.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.340]   That's the effect.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:38.100]   Trembling, falling down, even before the servants of the Lord.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.940]   Everything about them and this tremendous action in the earthquake has convinced and
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.460]   convicted this man of his sin.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:50.300]   And he, you see, like the woman of Samaria, suddenly all that he is flashes before him
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.500]   on a screen as it were and he's horrified.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.100]   He says, "What can I do?"
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.780]   My dear friends, you know, we can't be Christian without something of this.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.780]   It's impossible.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.740]   It's here everywhere in the Scriptures.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.940]   And this is one of the essential preliminaries.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:13.740]   To receiving of his fullness and grace upon grace, to having the well of water springing
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.180]   up into everlasting life.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.660]   But you may say this is all New Testament times.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.900]   That's the argument today, isn't it?
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.380]   All that was all right in the time of the apostles.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.380]   No longer, it finished with the apostles, all that.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.300]   The New Testament, you see, you mustn't judge yourself by the New Testament.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.900]   That was quite an exceptional period.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.060]   What a terrible lie that is.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.860]   What a terrible thing to do with the Word of God.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   What a way to narrow it down to the measure of our little understandings.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.740]   But you see, it's not even true historically.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:52.140]   Come subsequent to the end of the New Testament, begin to read the history of the Church.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.140]   And there it is.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.100]   There are any number of books, biographies of the saints, Church history, mentioning
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.700]   these outstanding men.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.580]   Well, read the stories.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:09.060]   And what you'll find invariably is what you found in the Scriptures.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:14.040]   Read if you like, start with the men like a Saint Augustine of Hippo.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.820]   Read the story of his conversion.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:25.580]   And what you'll find is this increasing conviction of sin, before he found peace and joy and
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.580]   release and happiness.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.060]   And the restoration.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:36.140]   And that in his struggling, knowing that he was wrong, being convinced and convicted,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.140]   but resisting.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.700]   And at last the abandon.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.260]   It's invariable.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.500]   Martin Luther.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:52.900]   Next week we are hoping to commemorate something of that great day when he nailed the 95 feces
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.820]   to the door of the church at Wittenberg.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.820]   What's the story of Luther?
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:03.420]   Well, the essential story of Luther, as I hope to try to show week next Wednesday, was
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.820]   conviction of sin.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.860]   You don't understand the Protestant Reformation apart from this.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.380]   You know, it isn't the result of a conference.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.180]   You see, we are living in an age of conferences and the ecclesiastics.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.380]   They meet in conference and they decide this and that.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.220]   You never get a Reformation like that.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   No, no.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.740]   It happened in the soul of a man.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.820]   And he's convinced and convicted of sin.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.740]   He's in agony.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.220]   It's invariable.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:40.340]   Perhaps one of the greatest Christian classics in these matters is John Bunyan's Grace Abounding.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.740]   Or if you like, Pilgrim's Progress.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.740]   It doesn't matter.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.140]   Read both of them and you'll find exactly the same thing.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.700]   That mighty man John Bunyan, tinker as he was with his great soul.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:57.700]   For eighteen months he passed through an agony of repentance, seeing the vileness of his
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.900]   own heart, seeing his utter helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:07.780]   Go on to the next century and read about the conversion of Whitefield and the two Westleys,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.500]   John and Charles, and you'll find the same thing.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.540]   These men felt such a conviction of sin that they became physically ill.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.220]   There are points when you feel they're almost losing their reason.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   What's it due to?
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.500]   It's due to this agony of soul.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.620]   These marvelous mighty men of God.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.580]   This is the invariable rule.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.560]   This is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.260]   When the Spirit deals with a man, he must produce conviction of sin.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.900]   See a man that told me all things that ever I did.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.420]   You see yourself for the first time in your life.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.180]   The man of the world has never seen himself.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.860]   That's why he goes on as he is.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:55.460]   But then on top of all these individuals, read the stories of the great revivals in
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:03.780]   the long history of the Church, and you will find without a single exception that at the
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:11.100]   beginning in the early stages of every revival, the first effect has been a terrifying conviction
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.300]   of sin.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.380]   Now this happens to people who've been brought up in the Church, who've been Church members
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:23.740]   perhaps for many, many years, highly respected, regarded as great religious people.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.860]   Suddenly the Spirit comes down, and these very people, they begin to feel they've
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.660]   never been Christians at all.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.140]   And they're in trouble, they don't know what to do.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:38.020]   Can be so powerful as to make them fall to the ground in a great spiritual agony and
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.020]   crisis.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.060]   Now I'm not saying this, this is history.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.540]   I'm just commending you to read history.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:49.020]   But all I'm trying to show you is that the Spirit always does what our Lord prophesied
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.020]   he would do.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:54.220]   He starts by convicting us of sin.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.620]   You don't start where you are without feeling anything and accept Christ into your heart.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.060]   Now, now, there is conviction of sin.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:05.780]   See a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.060]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:15.980]   So you see, I say it is something that is invariable in all the great movements of the
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   Spirit, whether in individuals or in masses of people at the same time.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:24.620]   And let me conclude with this argument for this morning.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:32.580]   Sure, there is no meaning in the word salvation apart from this.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.240]   Is Christ your Savior?
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.220]   What do you mean by that?
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.540]   What is a Savior?
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.540]   What is salvation?
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:48.980]   Surely by definition, a Savior is one who saves us from something, from a predicament,
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.620]   from a position, from trouble.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.940]   The Savior, salvation, what is it?
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.680]   Well, you see, there's only one answer to all this in the whole of the Bible.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.180]   And you remember the angel that appeared to Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.940]   our Lord.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.780]   He made this quite plain to her at the very beginning.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:19.940]   Put it in terms that are quite explicit, so there should never be any misunderstanding
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.740]   about this at all.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.100]   It was concerning the name that was to be given to this child that was to be born.
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:30.460]   While he thought on these things, Joseph, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.740]   him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:40.100]   wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:50.180]   a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.100]   That's why he's to be called Jesus.
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:59.940]   That's why he's called the Christ, the Messiah, the Savior.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:04.220]   There's no sense, there is no meaning to the word salvation apart from this.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.260]   He saves from what?
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.620]   From the condemnation of the law.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.420]   You see, it's all there in that sense of Romans, but look at it in different ways.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:17.260]   Paul in putting it to the Galatians says, now the law, he says, was our schoolmaster
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.340]   to bring us to Christ.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.740]   What brings a man to Christ?
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.100]   The schoolmaster, the pedagogue.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.100]   What does he do it?
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   How does he do it?
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.340]   Well, he convicts us of our sin, he shows us our need.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.620]   That's the whole business of the law.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.740]   The whole of the Old Testament is preparation for the new.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:40.060]   The law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, to reveal our need to us, our emptiness
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.940]   and our world.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:50.740]   And indeed our Lord himself, this is what we are told of him.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:55.420]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.420]   under the law.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   What for?
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.580]   To redeem them that were under the law.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.580]   That's why he came.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:07.900]   So when he comes he says, I am come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.140]   The son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.860]   a ransom for many.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.860]   Why do they need a ransom?
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.620]   Why do they need to be saved?
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.620]   What's it all about?
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:25.420]   And there's only one answer, to save us from sin, to save us from the condemnation of the
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   law.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.740]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.740]   unto them.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.740]   That's it.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:38.700]   He hath made him to be sin for us that knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.700]   of God in him.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.780]   We are under the law, the whole world lieth guilty.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:49.580]   There's no sense in the word saviour or salvation unless we realize our guilt, our condemnation.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.740]   And so the triumphant cry of the redeemed is, there is therefore now no condemnation
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.940]   to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:04.740]   And if you don't say that first, are you saved, do you know what salvation means?
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:14.940]   The first thing is that we are saved from the guilt and the condemnation of our sin.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:22.300]   And so it follows, you see, that the very terms that we use and employ carry in them
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:32.420]   this essential principle that the first thing that any kind of contact with him does to
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:41.780]   us, whether in his teaching or whether in some experience of him, is to make us feel
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.340]   as the woman of Samaria felt.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:50.620]   I've met a man who's told me all things that ever I did.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.340]   I feel vile in his presence.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.340]   I'm unworthy.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.340]   I'm foul.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:46:00.260]   Have you felt that, my friend?
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:06.100]   I'm not asking you about the degree or the intensity with which you felt it.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:12.620]   I'm simply asking, as you think of him, is this the first thing that comes into your
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:19.820]   mind, that he has saved you from the guilt of your sin, from the condemnation of the
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:25.860]   law, that he's revealed to you what you are, and you're at a hopelessness and vileness
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.500]   and lost state, and has delivered you from it.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:34.060]   Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.260]   Is not this the Christ?
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.260]   That's the order.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.260]   And it's the only order.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.260]   Amen.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:50.820]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
