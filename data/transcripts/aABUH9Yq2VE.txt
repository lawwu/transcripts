[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   Do you use any of these tactics with family and friends?
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.720]   I do.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.160]   I think the biggest one that I use is the word because the thing that happens in
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.360]   conversations is we say what happened is factual.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.880]   It's interesting, but it doesn't tell me why you're doing something, why it matters.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.520]   The problem is if I say, well, tell me why you feel that way,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920]   or tell me why you did that.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.120]   I'm putting you in this self-evaluation mode that you can't
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.320]   really tap into in a conversation.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640]   Even with a therapist, you have a hard time doing it.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.960]   But if you're telling me that you did this and you did that.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.000]   And I say, because now I'm just handing you the next word for you to have to
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.540]   respond to it, I'm almost insisting that you tell me I'm creating a gap
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.160]   that you feel you have to fill in.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.960]   I say, because you feel like you have to pick that up and say, well, because
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   I wasn't feeling very good because I'm feeling this way that now you understand
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.720]   why, because it's an easy one to use with people.
