[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   There's another hack that might be useful here.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.200]   As soon as I started to get more connected
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.080]   with my essence as a storyteller,
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.560]   all of a sudden, this world of options began to appear.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.120]   It was like, oh, you could start a podcast,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.020]   you could write a book, you could write articles.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.600]   There are all these different ways
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.560]   that you could express yourself as a storyteller.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.120]   So then the question is, what do I do?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.480]   One of the tools in the book is what I call a Dharma deck,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.960]   which is anytime something emotionally inspired me,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.240]   I would literally write it down on an index card.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.560]   Then what I would do is about once a week,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.800]   I would go to a quiet place or take a walk,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.760]   and I would take that stack of index cards with me,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.360]   and I would sort them from top to bottom.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.200]   The ones that had the most emotional pull for me,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.240]   the ones that were calling me the most,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.560]   stayed at the top of the pack.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.480]   The ones that didn't went to the bottom half of the pack.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.880]   And what you notice over time is that
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.600]   there would probably be like
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080]   somewhere between one and three cards
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.600]   that will always just stay at the top of the pack, right?
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.640]   No matter what, it's like,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.040]   those are the ones that you don't wanna give up.
