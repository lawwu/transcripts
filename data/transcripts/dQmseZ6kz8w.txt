[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.260]   .
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.640]   Engineers, founders, sponsors, partners, colleagues, and friends,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.420]   welcome to the AI Engineer Summit 2023.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:35.740]   I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to host you
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.600]   all at this event with my co-host, Swix.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.720]   And I'm especially delighted to kick off the presentation
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.240]   portion of the summit.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.220]   We've curated two days of stage talk content for you
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.000]   from some of the top founders and engineers
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.660]   in this versioning new industry of AI engineering.
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.740]   In just a few moments, Swix is going
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.880]   to come on stage to help set the context for those talks.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.180]   But for my time on stage, I really want to know who is here.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.420]   So AutoGPT is here.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:18.100]   A few months ago, they were just an open source project.
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.400]   Mind you, the fastest growing open source project in history,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.620]   but just an open source project.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.620]   Now, they're the presenting sponsor of the AI Engineer Summit.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.920]   So needless to say, we can expect some big announcements when Torrin takes the stage
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.920]   in a few moments.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.140]   Let's see who else is here.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.140]   SuperBase.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.140]   SuperBase is here.
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.140]   The social media experts who make product launches fun,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.140]   and who make databases both easy and trustworthy, given that they're open source.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.140]   They're a diamond sponsor this year, and we're honored that they broke their no event sponsorships
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780]   policy for this event.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.360]   So Paul, Ant, let me know how that policy change works out for you.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.580]   Fixie is here.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.580]   Where's Fixie?
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.580]   I'm looking forward to asking their booth sidekick if they can see what I'm wearing yet,
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.580]   and if they can recommend any updates to my wardrobe.
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580]   We'll call this sidekick Derek.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   And if Vision is not in the cards yet, Matt and Ben, I can make an intro to Logan Kilpatrick,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.680]   and perhaps we can get a preview of that Vision API.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.900]   Microsoft is here.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.140]   The company who helped to commercialize this movement by pumping 13 billion dollars into
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140]   OpenAI.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.740]   And many of you might be thinking, "Well, how can I get some of that gravy for my startup?"
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.940]   Well, head over to their booth in the Carmel room, just past the elevators behind you, and
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.320]   have a chat.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.940]   They have representatives from Microsoft for Startups who can help to open those doors for
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.940]   industry.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.160]   And if you have any questions for the co-pilot team, well, Microsoft's booth is right next
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   to GitHub.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.460]   Oh, and happy belated birthday, Cloudflare, who is here.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.640]   Round of applause.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.760]   They have-- Cloudflare, you are now 13, so that means you're going to be going through
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   some changes.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.940]   But don't worry, there's plenty of folks who will be delighted to talk to you about those
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.300]   changes at your booth, just next to Microsoft and Carmel across the elevators.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.520]   Alessio Finelli is here.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.320]   The VC half of the Latent Space podcast, but no less technical than Swix.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.820]   Perhaps after watching some of today's talks, we can convince him to come back to the founder
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.820]   world.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.520]   A little bit easier, right?
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.740]   But this time, Alessio, let's get you a software startup and leave the hardware to the experts.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.960]   Some of you got that joke.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   And who else is here?
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   Well, of course, you.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.180]   You're one of 500 people who were selected to attend the inaugural AI Engineer Summit.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.400]   So give yourselves a round of applause.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.440]   This means that you're not only an experienced software engineer, but that you're actively
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.400]   experimenting with, shipping to production, or have founded an AI-enhanced or AI-native apps
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   and companies.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.620]   So I want you to remember this when you're interacting with one another.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.160]   But we also want to recognize the many people who are not here today, but are watching the
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.580]   live stream.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.060]   We thank you and appreciate you, and we hope that you enjoy the content on the live stream.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.600]   And be sure to watch tomorrow's opening keynote address for some exciting announcements for 2024,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.100]   which will expand our participation limits.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.680]   But for those of you who are here, we hope that you've been enjoying your conversations with
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.900]   other attendees so far.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   One of the reasons that I really love conferences is that it brings together experts from around
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.200]   the world who are passionate about a singular niche subject.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.580]   And so most of your conversations are already high signal.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.580]   But is there a way we can actually improve this?
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.760]   Many of you have downloaded our conference mobile app, Network, and have been enjoying
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.260]   its use.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.840]   It includes the conference schedule, a full list of all of our expo partners, recommended
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.220]   restaurants, bars, and cafes within walking distance of the venue, and other event information.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:39.600]   But in addition to these features, we're pleased to announce AI-enhanced matching using our generative
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.880]   matching algorithm, which is a fancy way of saying we use LLMs to match you with the right people.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.780]   We can match you with people who help to solve your stated problems.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.700]   We all have problems we need to solve.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.000]   That's why in your network profile, you can literally tell us what problem you're looking
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.280]   to have solved, and our GMA will connect you with the right people.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.560]   We call this app Network.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.280]   You can download the app today at ai.engineer.network.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.260]   The matching is currently limited to in-person attendees of this summit only, but we have one
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.160]   more big announcement that we'd like to make.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.860]   We are pleased to announce that we are an open-sourcing network, both the event app and the matching
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.260]   algorithm.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.580]   Our goal is to provide a simple yet powerful mobile event experience for attendees at any
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.000]   event around the world.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.900]   And we hope that the matching algorithm can better assist to connect people at those events.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.820]   And we'd like to thank our lead engineer, Simon Stermer, for the mobile app, and Suizets Teller for
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.220]   our identity matching algorithm, and our infrastructure partners, Dscope for Auth, and Supabase for
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.940]   Database and PG Vector.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.220]   So go talk to them about PG Vector outside.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:08.460]   So a round of applause for all of our developers, partners, for this app.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:22.240]   So you can access the repo today at ai.engineer.network, or github.com slash ai.engineer.network.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.620]   So with that, I'd love to welcome our first speaker to the stage.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.260]   He's the co-host of the Latent Space podcast and the co-founder of this very summit.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.080]   Please join me in welcoming to the stage, Swix.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.340]   We'll see you next time.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.720]   We'll see you next time.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:43.580]   We'll see you next time.
