[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The following is a conversation with K. Yu Jin, an economist at the London School of Economics
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.140]   specializing in China's economy, international macroeconomics, global trade imbalances,
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:19.060]   and financial policy. She wrote the highly lauded book on China titled The New China Playbook,
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.660]   Beyond Socialism and Capitalism, that details China's economic transformation since 1978
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.520]   to today. And it dispels a lot of misconceptions about China's economy that people in the West
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.500]   have. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.880]   and consider subscribing to this channel. And now, dear friends, here's K. Yu Jin.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.100]   What is the single biggest misconception the West has about China's economy today?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.420]   The biggest misunderstanding is somehow that a group of people or even just one person runs the
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.820]   entire Chinese economy. It is far from the reality. It is a very complex, large economy. And even if
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.180]   there is an extreme form of political centralization, the economy is totally decentralized. The role that
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.140]   the local mayors, I call this the mayor economy, plays in reforms, but also driving the technological
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.700]   innovation that we're seeing right now, it is actually not run by just a handful of people. It's more
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.360]   decentralized than the U.S. is. And I think more broadly, a big misunderstanding is really the
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.800]   relationship between Chinese people and authority.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.200]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.680]   Well, you know, people think that somehow there's almost blind submission to authority in China. We
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.920]   have a very nuanced relationship with authority, whether it is, you know, between kids and parents or
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.740]   students and their teachers or with your bosses and the Chinese government. It's kind of the same
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.020]   thing. There's paternalism. They think that they're responsible for you. But deference,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.760]   a certain amount of deference to authority is not blind submission. It's been written implicitly in
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.060]   our contract for thousands of years that in exchange for some deference, we are given stability,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.540]   security, and peace, and hopefully prosperity.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.800]   So there is some element that we have in the West of freedom of the individual. So a little bit of the
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.540]   rebel is allowed in balance with the deference to authority.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.460]   Yeah, absolutely. Without that, how can you have this radical, dynamic entrepreneurialism
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.640]   you see in China? If you don't have a sense of self, a sense of the fact that you can find
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.420]   opportunities, you look for opportunities, you drive opportunities, it's all self-motivated.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.920]   Is there still a young kid in China that's able to dream to be sort of the stereotypical Steve Jobs
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.620]   in the garage, start a business, and change the world by doing so?
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.780]   There are millions of young kids like that in China. They might not be thinking about changing
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.320]   the world. And this is where the Chinese approach to innovation is very different from the Silicon
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.180]   Valley one, I'd say. But they see opportunity. They see a country with a billion consumers.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.560]   They see scale. They see speed. They see that with their dreams and the team that you have in China
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.340]   with engineers and the digital transformation, you can do so many things. And this generation of young
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.160]   people think about transforming their local economy. I think we're going to get into this, but
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.820]   it's no longer going to just be manufacturing. The young kids are entrepreneurs.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.000]   Well, let's stay in the big picture a bit. There's a perception that China
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.460]   is a communist country. So to what degree is China a capitalist country and to what degree is it a communist country?
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.220]   I've rarely seen a more capitalist
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.500]   society than China from the pure economic
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.760]   side. I've rarely seen companies that are as competitive
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.640]   as Chinese companies, people as ambitious
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.460]   and obsessed with making money as Chinese people,
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.560]   kind of ruthless, actually. And look, you know,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.840]   consumers shop, firms invest.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.740]   If you invest well financially,
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.860]   you'll get great returns. What is not capitalistic about
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.620]   the Chinese economy? At the same time,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.780]   the social fabric is highly socialist.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.060]   First of all, the state or enterprises dominate in many of the sectors. The state banks control the financial system.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.300]   We often talk about
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   common prosperity, about equal opportunity,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.340]   just and fair society. But
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.320]   even, you know, daily stories,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.220]   a walk in the park behind my
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.300]   parents' apartment, you're going to find
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.600]   at least 50
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.680]   organized social groups
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.800]   on a daily level,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.360]   singing, dancing, exercising,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.180]   doing whatever these fantastic,
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.980]   idiosyncratic hobbies they have,
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.700]   getting together
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.300]   every single day.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.860]   And free courses for the elderly and retired,
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.000]   right? That sense of communalism,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.540]   that sense of
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.680]   belonging,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.160]   that strive for harmony
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.980]   at the societal level is there.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.020]   So, just to go back to something you said,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.280]   there is a value for competition,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.900]   culturally.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.400]   So, on the business side,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   on the economic side,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.740]   there
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.880]   is sort of a cultural
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.120]   value of
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.720]   people competing in a meritocratic way.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.620]   Competition is ferocious in China,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.320]   especially when it comes to
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.040]   Chinese companies,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.680]   but also
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.740]   in education.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.640]   I should be thankful
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.420]   that I'm not,
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.660]   you know,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.200]   born later than I am
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.340]   because I thought China
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.700]   was pretty competitive already
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.280]   going to the schools
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.180]   and studying for the exams.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.960]   It is a different level today.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.360]   Competition is not necessarily
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.200]   in the culture,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.700]   I'd say.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.080]   It's driven really
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.640]   by the changing economic
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.680]   and social circumstances
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.280]   of the day.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.400]   The Chinese companies
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.480]   are all hardworking.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   They're all going after
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.020]   the market share.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.240]   They all kind of want
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.100]   to do the same thing.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.400]   You know,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.580]   it's not quite like in the U.S.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.640]   where you open a coffee shop.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.440]   Well, next door,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.240]   I'm going to, you know,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.600]   open a bagel shop, right?
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.380]   In China,
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.500]   if the coffee shop does well,
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.640]   everybody wants to open
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.820]   the same coffee shop.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.280]   And I think,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.760]   again,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.860]   I'm sure we're going to get to this,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.240]   but there's a lot of
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.440]   that kind of competition
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.500]   which really drives
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.760]   the world sometimes crazy
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.380]   of replication.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.460]   But it's because
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.520]   it's not easy, right?
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.460]   It's not easy to make money.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.060]   In the education system,
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.200]   there are not enough jobs
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.000]   for the young people.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.680]   So how do you get ahead?
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.020]   How, as, let's say,
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.460]   if you're part of
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.640]   a lower stratum society,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.900]   how are you going to make sure
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.000]   that your children
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.480]   are going to have
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.580]   a better life
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.040]   than you?
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.480]   You invest in education.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.440]   So everything is about
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.680]   competition in a country
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.000]   with 1.3 billion people.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.500]   That's somewhat
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.120]   to be expected.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.480]   Let's go back
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.420]   to the roots of that.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.720]   So you described
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.940]   that China's economy model
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.540]   is rooted in its history.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.620]   So can we talk
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.520]   about Confucianism?
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.140]   Can you explain
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.800]   to a degree
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.840]   those roots
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.500]   run back
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.340]   to Confucianism
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.980]   and in general
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.740]   to other parts
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.480]   of Chinese history?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.560]   Yeah, Confucianism
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.740]   is more of a moral philosophy
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.780]   than, let's say,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.320]   religion
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.860]   or a belief system.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.900]   It prioritizes
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.480]   social harmony
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.760]   above anything else.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.920]   It's not about
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.320]   metaphysics,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.500]   but more about ethics.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.680]   And at the individual level,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.800]   the responsibility,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   the duties
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.140]   are all meant
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.660]   to preserve
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.740]   that social order.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.240]   So it's filial piety.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.720]   It is loyalty.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.860]   It is how to be
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.580]   a Chinese gentleman.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.920]   But things like
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.580]   saving,
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.380]   frugality,
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.260]   is part of
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.240]   the moral discipline.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.660]   Education is part of
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.380]   the moral cultivation.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.080]   So there's a very
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.960]   strong emphasis
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.460]   that you as a citizen
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.120]   have a responsibility
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.340]   to contribute
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.320]   to society
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.980]   as a whole.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.660]   On the education side,
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.120]   a part of Confucianism
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.060]   is a value
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.880]   for meritocracy.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.440]   So how does that
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.060]   permeate
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.280]   the education system
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.260]   in China?
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.280]   You've already
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.260]   spoken to it a little bit,
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.300]   the value of competition
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.180]   and that it's already
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.280]   getting more and more intense.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.180]   But it would be
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.780]   very interesting
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.860]   to get your
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.540]   understanding
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.640]   of the education system,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.440]   its history,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.380]   and as it stands today.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.060]   If China were
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.200]   relatively successful
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.100]   economically,
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.120]   a huge part of the reason
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.160]   is by and large
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.540]   it's been meritocratic.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.600]   That is changing
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.480]   somewhat now,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.200]   but
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.260]   the only way
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.360]   that you have
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.080]   still that many
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.720]   poor people,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.900]   especially a couple
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.860]   decades back,
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.500]   still be
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.640]   in harmony
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.240]   with society,
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.220]   seeing all these
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.880]   rich people
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.060]   make tons of money
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.840]   and you're still
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.900]   belonging to that
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.940]   lower stratum,
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.640]   the only reason
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.420]   is that you believe
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.240]   that your children
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.920]   have a future
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.660]   through meritocracy.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.500]   And even though
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.080]   it's imperfect,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.020]   it's highly imperfect,
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.180]   standardized testing,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.060]   all this competition,
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.740]   all of the
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.320]   hours and the
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:03.980]   tutorials
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.080]   to studying
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.740]   for standardized
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.520]   exams,
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.380]   well,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.180]   that is
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.900]   a very realistic
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.560]   scenario in China
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.040]   because there's
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.700]   that many people.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.140]   You know,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.040]   when I was growing up
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.440]   in school,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.500]   we had 60 people
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.280]   per class
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.680]   and there were
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.300]   10 classes
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.220]   in one grade.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.960]   now imagine
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.700]   that many
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.660]   people applying
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.080]   for colleges
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   in the American
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.500]   way,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   how many essays
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.340]   would have been
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.380]   written and need
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.120]   to be scrutinized,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.920]   but also that
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.040]   gives room for
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.720]   total corruption,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.800]   if you,
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.440]   you know,
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.020]   if you know what I
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.220]   mean,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.820]   just connection-based
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.300]   and actually
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.540]   standardized exams
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.940]   as imperfect as it
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.800]   is to select
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   talent is still
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.440]   by and large
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.880]   fair.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.580]   And that's
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:46.940]   how that
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.800]   whole generation
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.260]   of,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.540]   you know,
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.160]   entrepreneurs,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.040]   but bureaucrats,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.840]   government officials
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.420]   were selected.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.060]   If you look at
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.520]   the Chinese
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.040]   premiers,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.460]   the presidents
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.320]   of the past,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.080]   they all went
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.720]   to great schools.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.060]   You know,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.500]   a lot of them
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.160]   were engineers
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.760]   and same thing
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.800]   for civil servants.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.340]   It has changed
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.780]   somewhat.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.440]   You know,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.200]   the meritocracy,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.540]   I think,
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.760]   is eroding in China.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.360]   I'm worried about
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   that because
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.820]   it is fine
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.440]   that you get
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.980]   into a good
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.760]   university based
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.200]   on your own
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.660]   merit,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.380]   but finding
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.220]   a job
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:15.880]   now becomes
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.380]   much less
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.960]   meritocratic.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.220]   People with
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.720]   connections
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.960]   get jobs
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.220]   more easily
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.280]   than others.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:22.840]   Of course,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.260]   this is not
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.800]   just a unique
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.540]   Chinese phenomenon.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:24.960]   It's actually
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.500]   everywhere,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.700]   but I guess
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.200]   what I'm saying
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.640]   is that
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.620]   that meritocracy,
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.360]   which was so
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.240]   fundamental to
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.200]   the ancient
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.120]   Chinese education
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.520]   system,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:32.900]   by the way,
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.780]   civil servants
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.660]   were selected
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.960]   based on
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.920]   standardized exams
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.500]   in the past.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.240]   That's always
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.320]   been throughout
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.420]   Chinese history
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.020]   and that relates
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.240]   to Confucianism.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.180]   now the
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.800]   opportunities
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.340]   and coming
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:44.640]   back to
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.580]   the competition
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.020]   point is that
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.760]   the opportunities
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.200]   are getting
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.760]   slimmer and
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.060]   slimmer.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:49.840]   Again,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.360]   this is not
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.700]   a unique
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.600]   Chinese phenomenon.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.620]   Jobs,
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.020]   where are the
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.460]   jobs going
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.820]   to be?
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.660]   Meritocracy
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.240]   has become
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.600]   more of a
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:57.860]   problem.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.760]   Do you have
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.380]   any memories
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:10:59.940]   of your own
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.660]   experience in
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:00.920]   terms of
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.340]   competition,
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.860]   the good
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.240]   and the bad
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.540]   of it?
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.880]   Maybe from
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.260]   that,
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.520]   can you pull
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.060]   out the thread
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.260]   of the value
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.720]   of that kind
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.280]   of competition?
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.000]   Basically,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.580]   I grew up
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:11.720]   in the
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.280]   Soviet Union,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.180]   so there's
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.380]   a kind
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.800]   of brutality
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.380]   to the
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:15.980]   competition,
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.780]   but I think
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.680]   it ultimately
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.600]   molds really
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.620]   interesting people.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.760]   There is a good
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.580]   and bad part
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.180]   of competition.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.740]   I remember
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.600]   when I was
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:25.860]   going to
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.500]   middle school,
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.560]   every single
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   midterm exam,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   final exam,
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.000]   you are ranked
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.600]   from number
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   one to number
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.320]   800 in your
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.300]   entire grade
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.020]   and publicly
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.600]   displayed.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.820]   Nice.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.980]   Very nice.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.880]   Imagine the
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.460]   majority of
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:42.800]   people and
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.060]   how they
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.280]   feel, but
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.120]   it does
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.200]   drive ambition
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.340]   in part,
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:48.860]   and you
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.260]   don't take
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.740]   anything for
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.160]   granted,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.280]   and you
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.860]   work hard,
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.200]   you keep
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.600]   the spirit
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.180]   up.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.260]   But going
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.560]   to the
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.180]   US, I
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:11:59.800]   finally realized
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.260]   that Americans
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.940]   are totally
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.360]   competitive,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.760]   it's just
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.040]   that they
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.220]   don't display
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.760]   it, it's
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.180]   not as
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.140]   apparent.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.740]   I remember
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.580]   I went to
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.040]   a very
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.360]   competitive
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.840]   high school,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.480]   but everyone's
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.200]   like, so
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.060]   chill, oh,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.400]   I'm not
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.840]   studying, oh,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.180]   you know,
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.280]   they're studying,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.160]   they are
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.660]   secretly
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.200]   studying.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.020]   When I was
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.440]   doing my
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.080]   PhD at
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.440]   Harvard,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.000]   people said,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.460]   oh, you
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:19.820]   know, my
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.240]   parents say
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.680]   don't work
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.280]   so hard,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.680]   you know,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.200]   people say,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.940]   don't say
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.300]   you worked,
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.980]   they're working
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.940]   hard, right?
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.820]   Just, you
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.740]   don't show
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:26.960]   it.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.460]   In China,
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   it's kind
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.220]   of a noble
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.160]   thing to show
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.540]   that you're
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.320]   working hard and
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.620]   that you're
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.540]   number one or
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.200]   that you're
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.640]   top of the
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.280]   class and
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.620]   you want to
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.340]   display it and
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.840]   you want to
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.580]   let everybody
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:37.920]   know.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.000]   But in the
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.920]   US, everybody's
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.520]   like secretly
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.200]   doing it.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.660]   Yeah, some
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.060]   of it is the
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.200]   signaling.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.340]   The culture
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.700]   emphasizes the
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.640]   signaling of is
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.120]   it better to
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.240]   be kind of,
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.180]   for everything to
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.880]   come easily,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.420]   thereby showing
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:53.860]   that you're a
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.480]   genius, it
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.060]   comes naturally,
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.920]   or is it
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.620]   better to show
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.320]   that you worked
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.560]   extremely hard for
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.380]   the thing, but
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:12:59.720]   the ultimate
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.460]   result is there's
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.120]   still competition.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:01.940]   but I don't
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.420]   know, when
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.240]   you're visually
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.760]   displaying and
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.220]   explicitly stating
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.960]   that it's good to
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.880]   be number one and
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.540]   it's bad to be
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.500]   number 800, I
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.260]   think that permeates
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.620]   throughout the
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.520]   culture to where
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.160]   you understand,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.300]   first of all, you
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.380]   understand that hard
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.060]   work is the only
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.520]   way to improve,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.240]   to succeed in
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:25.520]   life.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:26.920]   and second of
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.340]   all, you just
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.920]   create this
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.860]   framework of
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.460]   early on
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.220]   understanding what
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:32.640]   it means to
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.060]   live a good
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.380]   life.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.120]   And a part of
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.020]   that is to
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.740]   find the thing
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.220]   you're damn
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.760]   good at and
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.900]   get even
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.560]   better at it,
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.300]   master it,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.560]   become hopefully
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.180]   the best person
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:46.800]   in the world at
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.240]   that thing.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.040]   I don't know,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.420]   that's an
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.820]   extremely important
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.640]   lesson for society
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.080]   to teach.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   That's the
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.900]   right, I
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.440]   would say, the
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.340]   right kind of
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.920]   competition or
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   the efficient kind
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.540]   of competition.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.820]   I feel that in
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.640]   the Chinese education
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.300]   system, it was
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:00.720]   not necessarily
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.500]   efficient because
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   it kind of frames
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.380]   you and molds
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.060]   you to be
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.580]   thinking in a
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.280]   certain way
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.360]   what's been
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.020]   taught to you.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.680]   You don't have
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.600]   the bandwidth or
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.220]   the time or
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.560]   freedom to be
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.440]   more creative and
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.000]   to think outside
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.380]   the box.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.380]   There, it's just
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:13.880]   the box.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.500]   You maximize the
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.780]   box and that's
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:16.960]   it.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.740]   You don't actually
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.220]   know what's
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.900]   outside of the box
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.360]   and you never
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.040]   actually go there.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.260]   That's the bad
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.840]   part of Chinese
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.340]   competition.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.200]   When I got to
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.440]   the U.S., the
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:25.680]   high school
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.580]   teachers were
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.360]   asking us to
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.420]   question authority,
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.560]   to question text.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.020]   I'm like, wow,
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.980]   really you can do
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.340]   that?
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.680]   I started asking
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.040]   why.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.320]   All right, so
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.900]   there has been
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.900]   this miracle in
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.300]   the Chinese
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.260]   economy from
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.660]   after Mao
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.020]   under Deng Xiaoping
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.300]   where the
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:44.840]   Chinese economy
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.640]   got transformed
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.300]   and grew
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   incredibly.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.720]   Can you explain
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.260]   what happened,
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.980]   the different
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.780]   transformations that
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.140]   happened?
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.600]   the different
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.500]   reforms that
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.700]   happened under
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.420]   Deng Xiaoping?
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.560]   Deng Xiaoping
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.500]   was by far
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.400]   our most
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.300]   pragmatic leader
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.760]   and I think
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.260]   everybody is
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.560]   grateful to
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.000]   Deng Xiaoping.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.640]   My father's
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.480]   generation would
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.400]   not have seen
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.080]   that amount of
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.020]   prosperity and
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.920]   peace and
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.040]   opportunity without
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.500]   Deng Xiaoping.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.260]   It started in the
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.720]   late 1970s when
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   Deng Xiaoping came
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.360]   out with this
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.780]   open up and
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.020]   reform mandate
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.460]   and it was
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.920]   very tough.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.500]   Again, coming
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:21.920]   back to the
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.600]   big misunderstanding
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.460]   of China,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.220]   it's not as if
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.260]   one leader decides
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:25.780]   that that's what
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.020]   we're going to
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.380]   do and then
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.020]   everybody follows
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.800]   order and does
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.020]   that.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.280]   No.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.600]   There are tons
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.540]   of political
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.700]   barriers, tons
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.060]   of incentive
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.480]   compatibility problems
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.220]   at the local
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:35.500]   level.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.400]   In the end, you
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.440]   need the local
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.880]   provincial governors,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   the mayors to
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.960]   do the job.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.220]   And how many
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.100]   prefectures are
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.780]   there in China?
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.500]   A lot.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.880]   And they have
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.940]   their own interests.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.320]   We know this
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:50.940]   around the world.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.600]   Politically, it's
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.120]   the most difficult
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.700]   thing to do.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.260]   But somehow
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.060]   Deng Xiaoping was
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.620]   able to break
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.920]   tradition, break
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.180]   convention, come
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.580]   out with this
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.800]   completely new way
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.420]   of thinking about
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.960]   society, life, and
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.480]   the economy.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.440]   And it was so
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.040]   transformative.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.560]   I remember
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.460]   people of that
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.760]   generation told
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.000]   me one time that
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.200]   society was going
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.460]   to focus on the
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.020]   economy.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.040]   Really?
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.300]   Why would they
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:19.860]   do that?
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.900]   Wasn't it
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.500]   politics?
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.140]   Wasn't it
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.060]   everything about
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.920]   politics and
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.400]   struggle and
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.900]   ideology?
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.380]   So for them,
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.060]   that the whole
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.540]   country and the
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:27.980]   government is going
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.540]   to focus on the
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.360]   economy was just
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.660]   so shocking, even
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.140]   though we take it
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.900]   for granted now,
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.940]   that shows you
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.980]   that breaking
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.860]   that mold was
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.920]   incredibly difficult.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.440]   But I think
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.580]   opening up was a
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.320]   really momentous
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:47.800]   thing that China
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.020]   did.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.460]   And it wasn't
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.100]   just joining the
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.520]   WTO.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:49.900]   I mean, they
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.840]   were doing a
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.700]   decade of work
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.280]   in preparation
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:52.960]   leading up to
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.240]   that.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.320]   What's called
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.400]   special economic
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.140]   zone is really
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.860]   to turn Shenzhen
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.480]   from a fishing
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.780]   village to an
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.600]   export platform,
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.080]   now to a
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.620]   Chinese-style
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.320]   Silicon Valley.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.500]   And there
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:05.800]   was the
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.200]   agricultural
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.080]   reforms in
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.240]   the 1980s
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.580]   that meant
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.080]   that farmers
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.680]   could decide
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.140]   what they were
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.580]   going to grow
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.140]   and keep the
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.880]   surplus, whereas
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.220]   it was a
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:13.920]   collective system
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.660]   before.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   You know that
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.260]   very well.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.400]   And then, of
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:18.880]   course, the
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.380]   ultimate transformation
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.660]   was when China
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.480]   actually joined
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.460]   the WTO in
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.060]   2001.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.700]   And the rest
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.180]   was history,
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:26.420]   right?
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.000]   We're still
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.820]   talking about
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.460]   the aftermath.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.500]   But reforms
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.120]   was the
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.360]   single biggest
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.660]   impetus to
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.420]   Chinese growth.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.880]   And every time
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.260]   there was a
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.080]   major reform,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.780]   it was followed
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.720]   by a good
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.300]   decade-long
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.880]   growth.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.500]   Every time
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.140]   growth went
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.780]   down, there
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.560]   was a new
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.540]   series of
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.320]   major reforms
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.020]   rolled out.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.560]   And then,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.220]   oops, that
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.000]   led to
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.080]   another wave
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.020]   of good growth.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.740]   But I'd
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.200]   say that
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.280]   reform pace
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.300]   has slowed
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.460]   in the last
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.040]   15 years.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.500]   But are
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.200]   there reforms
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.740]   to be done?
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.500]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.220]   You know, has
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.300]   China reached
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.720]   even close to
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.400]   its potential?
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.820]   Not at all.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.500]   But again,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.440]   it comes back
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.020]   to politics,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.280]   right?
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.120]   Now it's less
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.820]   about economics,
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.740]   it's more about
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.400]   national security,
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.960]   it's more about
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.620]   politics, and I
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.100]   think that is
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.260]   probably the
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.880]   single biggest
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.000]   barrier to
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.160]   continued good
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:19.920]   economic growth.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.800]   Maybe can you
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.220]   speak to what
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.560]   it takes in
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   such a large
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.040]   system, in
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.400]   many ways,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   such a successful
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.060]   economy to do
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.500]   reform?
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.360]   So you mentioned
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.020]   pragmatism.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.120]   Deng Xiaoping
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.220]   famously said
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:30.660]   that it doesn't
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.260]   matter whether
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.740]   the cat is
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.460]   black or white
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.140]   as long as
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.660]   it catches
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.180]   mice.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.020]   So there's
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.460]   that pragmatism
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.960]   that I think
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.700]   underlies a lot
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.640]   of great reforms.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.900]   As a contrast
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.500]   to Soviet
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.320]   Union, the
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.060]   Chinese economy,
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:44.940]   as I mentioned,
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.720]   was extremely
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.240]   decentralized.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.940]   You know, in
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.520]   Soviet Union,
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.340]   the ministries
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.240]   were in charge
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.920]   of essential
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.820]   bureaucracy,
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.960]   democracy, but
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.860]   a lot of
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.260]   the power
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:53.720]   were given
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.400]   to these
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:54.800]   provincial
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.220]   governors,
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.180]   party secretaries,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:56.980]   mayors of
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   different sorts,
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.620]   and they
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.360]   were incentivized.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.960]   That's the
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.800]   key, is that
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.400]   these mayors
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.280]   were incentivized
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.160]   to do a good
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.600]   job.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.380]   If I were
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.060]   successful on
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.560]   a radical
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.180]   reform, if I
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.800]   were successful,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   I'd be a
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.540]   national hero,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.400]   and then that
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.120]   reform would be
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.900]   rolled out in
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.320]   every single
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.060]   city in the
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.660]   country over
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.960]   time, and I
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.180]   would be
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.080]   promoted to the
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.680]   higher run of
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.180]   the central
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:19.960]   government, and
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.440]   who knows,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.840]   I might
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.520]   even become
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.080]   vice premier,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.920]   premier president
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.640]   one day.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.420]   That was how
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.320]   the individual
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.280]   was motivated
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.560]   to carry out
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.040]   these really
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.780]   tough reforms.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.140]   Now, China
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.240]   has changed a
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.920]   bit, right?
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.660]   It's not about
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.340]   being radical,
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.260]   and radically
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.840]   successful.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.260]   It's about
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.540]   being safe,
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.300]   right?
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.820]   So when you
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.460]   shift from
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.160]   basically an
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.600]   entrepreneurial
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.820]   state to a
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.520]   safe state,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.020]   then the
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.120]   objective function
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.040]   changes, and
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.900]   you see it in
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.860]   different economic
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.020]   outcomes.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.940]   So maybe can
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.300]   you speak to
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:55.460]   that?
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.780]   What are some
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.320]   important things
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.740]   to understand
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.100]   about the
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:58.560]   structure of
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.020]   the Chinese
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:19:59.400]   state?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.180]   Well, the
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.160]   central leadership
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.840]   politically is
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.740]   extremely powerful
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.440]   and very
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.520]   consolidated, but
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.060]   they hold a
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.020]   very crucial key
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:08.600]   to the local
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.880]   governments, which
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.280]   is that they
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.820]   decide their
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.120]   fate.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.200]   Am I going
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.560]   to promote
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:12.840]   them?
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.220]   Am I going
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:13.540]   to put them
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:13.960]   in jail?
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.560]   Am I going
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.000]   to fire
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   them?
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.760]   Am I going
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.240]   to reward
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.400]   them?
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.620]   Am I going
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.060]   to punish
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.240]   them?
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.460]   They hold
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.040]   that crucial
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.480]   key.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.000]   And I think
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.420]   what was very
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.620]   surprising for
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.940]   most of the
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.700]   Western audience
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.940]   is that when I
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.380]   mentioned about
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.780]   the mayor
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.300]   economy,
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.560]   why don't
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.280]   our American
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.060]   mayors in
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.780]   each city do
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.680]   these very
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.640]   radical things
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.300]   and then push
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:34.760]   for GDP
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   growth and
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.000]   technology and
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.380]   innovation?
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.080]   It's quite
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.440]   different.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:38.980]   I think this
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.740]   is where
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.240]   China is
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:40.900]   very unique
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.160]   in the
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.720]   world, is
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.420]   that political
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.340]   centralization,
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:43.900]   economic
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.960]   decentralization,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.700]   and the
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.520]   yardstick to
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.000]   measure local
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.640]   mayors'
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.560]   competence
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.600]   through, in
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:51.920]   the first
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.300]   stage, it
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:52.660]   was GDP
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.000]   growth.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.300]   So I
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.420]   am a
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.280]   mayor of
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.960]   the city
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.620]   of Nanjing
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.240]   in Jiangsu
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.580]   province.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:58.860]   I'm going
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.820]   to peek at
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.660]   my neighbor's
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.340]   mayor's
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.940]   city's GDP
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.560]   growth, and
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:03.780]   I'm going
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.180]   to be very,
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.720]   very competitive.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.300]   By the way,
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:05.800]   I forgot about
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.020]   that.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:06.560]   Competition
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.980]   is extremely
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.560]   competitive
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.340]   among the
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.560]   local government
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.260]   officials because
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.100]   you are competing
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.920]   with other
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.680]   mayor for a
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.420]   top job,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:14.620]   right?
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:14.960]   So you need
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   to do better
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.800]   than them.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.480]   And whether
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:17.860]   that was
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.680]   efficient structure
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.580]   or not,
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.060]   I cannot comment,
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.180]   but it certainly
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.340]   just fueled
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.900]   this massive
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.720]   and rapid
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.480]   expansion,
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.540]   economic expansion.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.460]   First, it was
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.360]   industrialization.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.080]   Everybody wanted
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.780]   to do exports.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:33.880]   Then they
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.300]   discovered,
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.200]   oh my gosh,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.140]   we can have
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.600]   so much
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.340]   fiscal revenues
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.880]   coming from
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.740]   land, right?
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.500]   Selling land
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:39.940]   and real estate.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.180]   Let's build
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.820]   real estate
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.460]   and let's
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.000]   urbanize.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.240]   And then the
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.820]   money kept
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.680]   coming in
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.060]   to these
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.960]   local governments
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.400]   and that they
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:47.880]   can spend
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.100]   it on nurturing
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.260]   more companies
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.160]   or supporting
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.660]   real estate
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.000]   or supporting
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.560]   investment
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.520]   and they can
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:53.920]   do a better
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.180]   job.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.020]   So then it
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.340]   was geared
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.680]   towards real
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.200]   estate and
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.540]   that's how
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.060]   the property
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.080]   cycle became
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.220]   the big thing.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.040]   Everything
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.320]   was at
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.280]   double speed
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.300]   because of
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.840]   what the
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.720]   local government's
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.320]   incentives were
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:07.960]   designed to do.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   I say now
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.380]   that China's
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:10.960]   biggest challenge
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.620]   is consumption,
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:11.980]   right?
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.460]   It's not
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.140]   production.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.880]   We know that
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.400]   China's very,
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:14.920]   very competitive
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.500]   in production
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.160]   and supply.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.220]   China needs
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:17.860]   to be a
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.720]   consuming country
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.500]   to be a rich
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:19.800]   country.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.420]   Why don't you
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.040]   put consumption
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.700]   as part of
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.660]   the yardstick
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.280]   for measuring
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.160]   local governments?
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:24.480]   You know,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:24.980]   for a while
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.560]   there's environmental
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.060]   protection.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.700]   Guess what?
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.760]   Very few of them
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.420]   really want to do
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:28.920]   it seriously
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.760]   because it goes
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   against the
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.120]   incentives of
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.900]   driving growth,
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.340]   right?
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:34.920]   They would
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.460]   suffer on
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.080]   GDP growth
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.760]   if they were
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.680]   very serious
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.160]   about environmental
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.620]   protection.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.520]   So for a couple
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.860]   years nothing
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.600]   happened in
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.280]   China on that
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.540]   front.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.180]   And then the
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.720]   central government
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.380]   got really
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.300]   kind of
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.520]   concerned and
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.080]   even angry
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.740]   and frustrated.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.620]   So they
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.280]   decided to put
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.120]   that as a
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:50.840]   penalizing
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.700]   factor.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.460]   And then guess
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:52.860]   what happened?
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.140]   Well,
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:53.960]   actually environmental
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.860]   protection
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.100]   sped up and
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.740]   you know,
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.600]   in a matter of
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.620]   short few years
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.140]   I see blue
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:00.780]   skies every day
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.180]   in Beijing.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.140]   That's how it
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.400]   works.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.000]   So GDP is a
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.500]   measure of
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:05.940]   success in
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.320]   production.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.760]   What's the
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.520]   measure or
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.000]   what does it
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.320]   mean to be
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:11.820]   successful on
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.220]   the consumer
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.540]   side?
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.040]   You said it's
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.620]   important to
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.220]   improve that.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:14.640]   What does it
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.160]   mean to be a
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.600]   successful
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.120]   consumer nation?
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.740]   The metrics
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.400]   shouldn't be
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.000]   geared just
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.100]   towards growth
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.580]   alone,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.280]   GDP growth
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.540]   alone.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.060]   It was just
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.060]   singular GDP
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.860]   growth and
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.020]   you can borrow
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.480]   heavily and just
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:27.840]   spend on
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.360]   infrastructure.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.160]   that's not
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.560]   a productive
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.140]   way to
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:30.580]   drive the
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:30.900]   economy.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.300]   That's what
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.080]   the local
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.660]   governments were
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.320]   doing for a
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:33.780]   long period of
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.060]   time.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.280]   You know,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.940]   in the last
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.600]   few years,
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.360]   innovation,
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.340]   unicorns,
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:38.820]   have kind of
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.120]   been an
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.620]   implicit yardstick
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.360]   for local
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:41.700]   governments.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.960]   That's kind of
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.400]   how we've
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.420]   seen these
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:44.940]   great, you
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.020]   know,
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.860]   EV companies,
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.700]   80 cities
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.420]   doing EVs.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.660]   I mean,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.380]   do we really
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.480]   need 80 cities
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.200]   to do their
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.860]   own EVs,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.100]   right?
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.200]   Solar panels,
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.360]   now DeepSeek
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.200]   has become,
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.600]   you know,
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.340]   a star.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.580]   Semiconductor
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.060]   companies,
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.360]   you know,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:57.980]   each local
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.660]   government wants
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.160]   to have their
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.260]   own national
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.800]   champion.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.840]   So,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.600]   implicitly,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.520]   technology was
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.360]   part of the
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:04.860]   yardstick
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.820]   competition as
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.240]   well,
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.960]   but if you
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.220]   can more
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.140]   accurately have
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:10.760]   a metric for
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.640]   consumption measures
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.400]   really focus
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.180]   on, you
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:13.220]   know,
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.940]   making sure
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.340]   that it's
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.860]   coming from
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.360]   consumption,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.820]   this GDP
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.160]   growth,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.600]   rather than
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.320]   from investment
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.100]   or infrastructure,
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.380]   then I think
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.480]   that it might
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.740]   focus the
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.320]   government's
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.540]   objective a bit
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.340]   more on
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.700]   thinking about
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.180]   how to make
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.340]   people feel
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.000]   more secure
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.580]   so that they
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.000]   want to save
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.200]   more.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:30.720]   For instance,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.460]   creating more
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:31.780]   jobs,
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.160]   for instance,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.600]   more on
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.460]   social security
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:33.880]   spending,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.300]   on health
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:34.560]   care,
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.680]   on elderly
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.120]   care,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.660]   because for
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.060]   the longest
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:38.480]   period of
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:38.860]   time,
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.760]   this political
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.500]   economy model
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.240]   was brilliant
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.980]   at scaling
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.680]   up supply,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.340]   but it was
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.140]   extremely weak
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.640]   at raising
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.140]   personal
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.700]   consumption
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.660]   because the
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.300]   incentive does
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.320]   not lie in
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:48.700]   consumption,
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.600]   it lies in
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.040]   production.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.020]   So,
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.780]   you shift the
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.420]   objectives a
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:52.820]   little bit
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.420]   and maybe the
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:53.860]   local government
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.680]   will do more
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.760]   to stimulate
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.300]   consumption.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:56.920]   Okay,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.420]   you mentioned
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.140]   the mayor
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:58.580]   economy.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.580]   That seems like
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.240]   an incredibly
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.480]   powerful idea.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.540]   And you also
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.020]   mentioned that
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.800]   perhaps you're
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.900]   not sure exactly
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.520]   how perfectly
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.640]   efficient it is
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.260]   and what
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.920]   efficiency there
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.220]   means.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.540]   How good are
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.440]   you at
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.700]   quickly figuring
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.360]   out the best
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:13.980]   ideas?
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.880]   That's what an
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.380]   efficient market
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:15.720]   does.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.700]   There's a kind
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.380]   of component to
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.640]   what you're
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.120]   saying where
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.600]   you're a little
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.460]   bit critical
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.040]   of do you
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:21.600]   really need
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.480]   ADEV
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.020]   companies?
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.620]   But maybe you
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:23.800]   do.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.240]   it seems
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.540]   like an
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.000]   incredible
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.500]   thing to
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.800]   do,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.200]   right?
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.260]   So what are
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:27.560]   the pros
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:27.900]   and cons
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.240]   of this?
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.600]   Maybe you
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:28.880]   can speak
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.160]   to it a
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.400]   little bit
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.620]   more.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.100]   I think
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.640]   it depends
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.620]   on the
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:31.920]   timing.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.080]   If you're
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.400]   starting
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.900]   something,
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.120]   starting a
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.880]   new emerging
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.320]   strategic
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:36.960]   sector like
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.460]   EVs or
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.320]   batteries or
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.060]   solar panels,
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.340]   you need
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:40.900]   the local
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.540]   governments to
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.100]   be involved,
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.980]   to mobilize,
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.840]   right?
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.520]   The big
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.640]   push to
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.780]   coordinate the
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.540]   supply chains.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.020]   If you wait
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.640]   for the markets
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.160]   to develop
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.680]   over time,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:49.940]   it's going
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.300]   to take a
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.580]   long time.
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:50.940]   Maybe they
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.240]   don't even
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.640]   want to do
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:51.820]   it,
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.120]   right?
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.400]   look at
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:52.780]   the U.S.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.140]   The U.S.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.440]   is very,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:53.960]   very behind
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.660]   on some
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:54.920]   of the
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.380]   new
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:55.880]   strategic
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.520]   sectors.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.060]   But once
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.480]   you've
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.720]   reached a
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.480]   certain level
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.240]   of market
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:01.780]   competition,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.240]   I think the
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.640]   state needs
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.460]   to withdraw
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.120]   or to
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:06.520]   retreat.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.540]   because
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.740]   ultimately the
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.340]   state is
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.160]   not the
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:10.800]   best at
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.600]   allocating
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.260]   resources,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.040]   picking
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.440]   winners.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.640]   You want
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.100]   the private
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.580]   actors,
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.120]   whether it's
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:16.560]   the venture
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.420]   funds or
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.340]   the through
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.240]   market competition
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.900]   to ultimately
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.600]   decide who
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.080]   gets the
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.940]   most resources.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.920]   But in the
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.180]   beginning,
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:23.840]   that big
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.480]   push is
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.320]   not really
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:25.820]   in any
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.140]   of the
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.480]   canonical
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.100]   models that
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.280]   I've
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.700]   studied in
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.280]   economics in
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:28.700]   the Western
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.460]   school of
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:29.740]   thought.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.960]   State push,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.400]   state
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.200]   mobilization,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:32.780]   state
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.440]   initiation,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.960]   that's not
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.200]   there.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.620]   But I
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:35.960]   think if
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.320]   you look
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.340]   at EVs,
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.280]   solar panels,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.020]   even just
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.560]   thinking about
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.100]   the idea of
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.660]   reforms in
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.020]   the first
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.500]   place,
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.460]   that initial
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460]   state push
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.380]   was vitally
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.020]   important.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.740]   The other
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.220]   negative,
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.320]   although I
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.100]   think by
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.500]   and large
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.080]   positive
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.880]   aspect,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.260]   is I
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.180]   don't think
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:55.560]   that we
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.280]   need 80
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:56.940]   cities to
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.280]   do their
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:57.800]   own EV
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.340]   brands,
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:58.960]   but to
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.720]   get started,
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.600]   maybe that's
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.340]   what it
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.600]   would have
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   taken to
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.360]   drive that
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.880]   incentive
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.880]   competitive.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.060]   And then
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.800]   ultimately it's
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.260]   up to the
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.780]   market to
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.200]   decide who
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.440]   are the
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.280]   last five
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:08.660]   remaining
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.360]   EV companies
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.020]   through market
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.580]   mechanisms.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.520]   That's
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.020]   Chinese-style
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:12.320]   industrial
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:12.840]   policy.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.160]   Industrial
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.660]   policy was
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:14.920]   heavily
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.480]   criticized,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.220]   and again,
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.020]   if I talk
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.500]   to my
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.380]   Harvard
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:18.860]   professors,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.280]   they will
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.900]   be very,
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.180]   very,
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.880]   very skeptical
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.160]   about the
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.040]   role of
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.480]   the state,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.380]   especially in
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.960]   such a
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.740]   major way.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.720]   But if you
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.080]   look at the
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.380]   Chinese
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.020]   experience,
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.800]   the evidence
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.320]   for success
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:30.760]   is all
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.060]   there.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.500]   The cities
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.280]   that have
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.800]   pushed the
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.740]   most on
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.280]   supporting
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.580]   that
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:35.940]   particular
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.420]   sector
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.080]   ultimately
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.780]   did the
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.120]   best in
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.440]   terms of
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:38.760]   production,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.160]   but also
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.460]   in terms
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:39.560]   of
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:39.960]   innovation,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.340]   measured
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:40.560]   by
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.000]   patents.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.300]   It's
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.240]   all in
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.400]   the
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:42.740]   data.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.300]   But the
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:44.700]   downside
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.600]   is that
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.280]   a lot of
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:46.640]   the capital
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.220]   is wasted.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.280]   And this
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:48.640]   is what I
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.180]   also discuss
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:49.500]   in my
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:49.840]   book,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.420]   is that
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.340]   it is
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.800]   inefficient,
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.200]   although
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:52.820]   maybe it's
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.360]   necessary.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.860]   The amount
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.580]   of waste
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.660]   of investment
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.840]   plowed
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.600]   into these
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.860]   companies that
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.400]   will ultimately
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.640]   just go
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.080]   under,
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.200]   but also
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:03.340]   the
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:03.940]   misallocation
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.180]   of
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:04.620]   resources
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.240]   because it's
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.580]   led by
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.120]   the state
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.020]   are some
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.220]   of the
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:07.740]   downsides.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.200]   But I
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.120]   guess on
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.880]   balance it's
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.440]   been positive
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.540]   because look
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.200]   at China's
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.060]   internal combustion
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.340]   engine effort,
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.080]   nothing,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.000]   right?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.940]   Semiconductors.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.300]   Thanks to
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:18.580]   Biden,
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.080]   thanks to
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.340]   Trump,
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.540]   it's improved
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.180]   dramatically.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.480]   But all
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.060]   these things
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.320]   that they
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.020]   tried to do
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.540]   before,
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.140]   they couldn't
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.280]   do.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:25.740]   But when
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.380]   it's a new
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:26.740]   thing,
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.440]   like something
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.240]   that there's
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.260]   no incumbent,
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.420]   no particular
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.220]   advantage in
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:31.760]   any country,
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.640]   actually China
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:32.960]   is really
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.480]   spearheading
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.000]   these sectors.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.120]   Can we linger
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:35.500]   a little bit
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:35.960]   more in this
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.640]   mayor economy?
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.200]   It just
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.040]   seems like
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:38.620]   such a
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.680]   powerful thing
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.560]   where one
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.400]   mayor looks
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.880]   over to the
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.640]   next and
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.480]   looks even
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.060]   just a
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.520]   trivially
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.200]   simple number
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.520]   like the
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:45.900]   GDP.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.420]   Why don't
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:47.840]   we do that
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.280]   in the United
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:48.940]   States or
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.360]   in the West
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:49.640]   more?
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.920]   Just compete
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.040]   on GDP.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:52.800]   Well,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.360]   you need to
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.860]   be elected
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.960]   and re-elected,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.640]   right?
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.500]   Is that what
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.360]   your electoral
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.040]   base cares
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.460]   about,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.240]   right?
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.200]   In China,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.960]   it's what
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.380]   the central
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:01.860]   government,
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.620]   your boss,
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.460]   cares about.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.100]   If you ask
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.580]   the consumers,
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.000]   they'd rather
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.780]   you spend
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.300]   on social
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:06.680]   spending,
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.180]   right?
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.480]   The things
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:07.820]   we talked
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.180]   about that
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:08.560]   stimulates
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.040]   consumption,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.120]   on education,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.740]   on healthcare,
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.500]   things that
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.440]   stimulate demand.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.300]   So that's
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:15.880]   the political,
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.760]   it's the
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.120]   difference of
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.460]   the political
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:17.880]   system.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.220]   So maybe
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:19.520]   can you
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:19.880]   speak to
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.480]   the difference,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.060]   another
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.620]   difference is
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.760]   the long-term
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.840]   multi-generational
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.200]   thinking that
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.620]   permeates
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.340]   Chinese culture.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:27.900]   So how
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.200]   does that
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.680]   differ from
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.580]   the Western
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.600]   style capitalism
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.000]   of quarterly
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:33.720]   focused
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.520]   thinking?
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.920]   The Chinese
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.000]   are both
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.460]   the most
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.660]   patient and
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.420]   the most
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.440]   short-termist
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.060]   economic
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.360]   actors I
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:44.620]   met.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.720]   The patience
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.120]   I don't need
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.700]   to explain
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.700]   because I
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.960]   think the
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.300]   political
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:49.860]   continuity
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.560]   means that
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.120]   they can
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.840]   make plans
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.400]   for two
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.300]   decades ahead,
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:53.900]   right?
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.680]   even longer.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.860]   The
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.840]   investment
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.720]   of Chinese
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.320]   parents in
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:29:59.480]   their
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:29:59.880]   children
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.280]   is a
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.380]   multi-decade
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.440]   long project
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.780]   and they
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.300]   save.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:05.740]   You know,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.200]   Chinese people
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:06.560]   love to
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.600]   save because
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.080]   they think
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:08.640]   that they'll
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.380]   have even
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.960]   more money
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.980]   if they
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.340]   save that
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:11.660]   money rather
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.180]   than spend
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.520]   it on a
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.180]   ski vacation.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.140]   So that
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.880]   I think
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.260]   it's
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:15.760]   patently
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.780]   obvious to
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.540]   most people
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.280]   around the
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:19.560]   world.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.780]   But I
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.260]   think that
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.840]   most of
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.160]   them would
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:22.860]   not have
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.340]   known that
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.440]   there's a
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.020]   very popular
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.900]   motto in
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.840]   China which
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.200]   is called
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.680]   short,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.380]   flat,
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:28.900]   fast.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:29.780]   that's
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.060]   the
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.720]   impatient
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   part of
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:31.640]   the
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:31.980]   Chinese
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.840]   culture
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.300]   especially
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.800]   with
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.080]   respect
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.240]   to
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:34.340]   the
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.680]   economy.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.880]   Short,
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.460]   flat,
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.680]   fast was
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.380]   used to
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:38.860]   describe a
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.100]   winning
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.760]   volleyball
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.340]   strategy
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:40.740]   that
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.140]   eventually
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:41.680]   became
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.440]   adapted to
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.920]   describing
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.540]   the society
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:43.820]   as a
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.020]   whole
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:44.380]   and
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:44.880]   economic
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.280]   decision
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:45.620]   making.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.800]   If you're
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.320]   an investor
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.060]   you only
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.400]   want to
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:48.760]   invest
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.340]   in things
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:49.660]   that you
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:49.800]   can
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.060]   quickly
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:50.320]   turn
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:50.560]   around
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:50.780]   make
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.000]   a lot
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.120]   of
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.380]   money
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.680]   and
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:51.900]   don't
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.040]   need
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:52.140]   to
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:52.260]   do
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:52.460]   much
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:52.820]   work.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.760]   It
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.000]   also
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.360]   applies
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:54.600]   to
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.080]   marriages.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.300]   So a
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.560]   short
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.220]   courtship,
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.880]   a very
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.300]   flat
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:58.900]   emotional
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.580]   relationship
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:30:59.860]   and a
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.060]   fast
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.380]   divorce.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.220]   That is
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.780]   how you
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.620]   see these
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.740]   companies
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.800]   rise
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.840]   within a
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.300]   very short
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:09.700]   period of
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:09.920]   time.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.260]   Of course
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:10.640]   investors
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.140]   are only
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.580]   interested
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:11.960]   in those
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.320]   companies
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.380]   that can
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.120]   turn around
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.660]   and exit
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.180]   in a
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.540]   very short
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:15.840]   period of
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.040]   time
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.400]   making
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.220]   many
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.420]   many
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:17.840]   multiples.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.900]   So in
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.480]   that sense
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.040]   people are
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:21.500]   very
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.320]   impatient.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.520]   I sit
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:24.840]   on some
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.140]   boards
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:25.920]   of these
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.080]   long-standing
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:27.720]   companies
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.420]   and
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.080]   the
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.500]   values
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.720]   are
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:29.920]   just
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.300]   so
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:30.920]   different.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.860]   Even
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.080]   though
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.340]   a lot
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:32.420]   of
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:32.560]   these
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:32.820]   public
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.180]   companies
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:33.360]   are
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:33.920]   constrained
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.440]   by the
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:34.760]   quarterly
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.480]   results
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:35.880]   and so
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.160]   forth,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.900]   but the
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.400]   values
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:37.800]   are
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.360]   about
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.380]   sustaining
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.540]   something,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.140]   a company,
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:41.840]   for a long
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.220]   time,
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:42.700]   thinking about
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.220]   organic
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:43.860]   growth,
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.200]   thinking about
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.900]   investments
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.340]   for the
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:46.660]   future,
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.200]   sustainability,
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.020]   maybe it's
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.760]   that competition,
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.500]   maybe it's
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.260]   the speed
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:51.740]   that we're
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.160]   used to
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.720]   in China,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.560]   people think
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.140]   about short.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.240]   So this
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:56.840]   dichotomy
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.240]   is very
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.780]   interesting.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.140]   That's
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.580]   surprising
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.020]   to me.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.100]   It's a
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.460]   surprising
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:01.920]   idea,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.180]   right?
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.880]   So there
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.180]   is a
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:04.560]   kind of
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.360]   in the
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:05.520]   West
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:05.940]   conception
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.380]   of
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.060]   Chinese
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:07.380]   culture,
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.760]   Chinese
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.180]   economy,
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:08.520]   that
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:08.920]   everything
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.320]   is
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.440]   50,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.880]   100,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.480]   200
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:11.860]   years
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.120]   out,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.580]   you have
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:12.780]   this
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.060]   long
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.400]   vision,
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.240]   but you're
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.500]   basically
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:14.880]   saying
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.380]   that there's
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.120]   a deep
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.860]   in the
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.120]   business
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.620]   sector
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.680]   impatience
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:19.900]   about
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.260]   everything.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.060]   That's
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:21.400]   a
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.140]   transitory
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.680]   phenomenon,
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.300]   I'd say.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.940]   But if you
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.420]   look at
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:24.900]   the cheaper
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.360]   stuff,
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.220]   poor quality,
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:27.640]   that's a
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.120]   reflection of
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.660]   the copying,
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.120]   it's the
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.480]   same kind
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:29.920]   of mentality,
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.400]   just get
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.040]   ahead quickly.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.520]   But again,
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.500]   that is
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:33.940]   all shifting.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.660]   That is
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.400]   all shifting
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.200]   because China
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.720]   is now in
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.040]   a different
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.540]   stage of
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:38.960]   development.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.360]   If you
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.260]   ask the
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:40.700]   younger
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.340]   generation,
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:41.820]   they really
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.220]   care about
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:42.700]   quality.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.580]   They care
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:43.760]   about
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.320]   values.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.680]   And these
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.100]   companies,
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:46.700]   these very
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.060]   successful
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.620]   companies,
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.400]   successful in
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:48.840]   five years,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.400]   ten years,
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:49.760]   found
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.200]   themselves
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:50.440]   in a
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:50.580]   very
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:50.920]   difficult
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.380]   position
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.280]   after a
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.460]   longer
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:52.700]   period
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:52.860]   of
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.120]   time.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.920]   So that
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.300]   short,
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:54.760]   flat,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.440]   fast attitude,
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:56.940]   which was
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.560]   so popular,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:57.980]   especially
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.620]   before the
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:58.980]   pandemic,
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.900]   that's
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.220]   actually
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:00.800]   somewhat
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.260]   disappearing.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.600]   So in
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.060]   some sense,
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.620]   this economic
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.320]   downturn is
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.860]   not that
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.300]   bad for
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.200]   China because
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.780]   it made
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.780]   the Chinese
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.540]   realize that
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:07.900]   it's not
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.440]   always going
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.980]   to go up
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.560]   and it
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.040]   made them
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.580]   really look
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.340]   down deeper
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.620]   into what
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.040]   they really
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.420]   should be
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.120]   focused on,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.540]   that there
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:16.780]   will be
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.160]   cycles,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.460]   there will
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:17.760]   be up
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.280]   and downs.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:18.820]   And so
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.260]   these very
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.520]   short-termist
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.800]   thinking and
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.960]   opportunistic
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.060]   way of
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.000]   driving business
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.800]   will ultimately
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.380]   fail.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.700]   it's bad
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.300]   for China
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.060]   that we're
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.500]   having a
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.880]   sustained
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.480]   economic
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.660]   softness,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.560]   sustained
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:34.960]   economic
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.460]   softness,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.600]   but I
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.140]   think it's
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.540]   also a
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:37.700]   very,
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.220]   very important
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:38.920]   lesson for
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.240]   the Chinese
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.580]   people to
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:39.900]   go through.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.500]   Let's go,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.200]   if we can,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.840]   a bit to the
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.120]   personal.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.480]   So you
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:43.960]   grew up in
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.240]   China.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.400]   What are
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:45.960]   some moments
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.520]   from childhood
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.120]   that were
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.600]   maybe defining
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.020]   to your
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.980]   understanding of
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.100]   Chinese culture
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.640]   Chinese economy?
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.160]   You know,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.840]   we look back
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.380]   at those
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.140]   moments when
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.720]   everybody in
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.120]   China was
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.940]   very poor
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.820]   with a bit
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.500]   of nostalgia.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.140]   I remember
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.540]   no doors were
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:04.780]   locked.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.620]   I was in
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.780]   Beijing and
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.480]   I remember
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.860]   every day in
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.340]   the summer
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.940]   everybody just
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.720]   went downstairs
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.340]   and chatted
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:12.800]   with everybody
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.140]   else.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.100]   it was very
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:16.500]   social,
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.560]   very community
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:17.940]   based.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.680]   The neighbors
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.160]   help each
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:19.400]   other.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.460]   We had
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:20.800]   very,
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.180]   very little
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.580]   small
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.140]   apartments,
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.220]   very limited
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:25.840]   access to
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.280]   certain goods.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:26.680]   When I was
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:26.940]   born,
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.140]   even in
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.360]   Beijing,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.260]   there were
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.260]   these vouchers
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.720]   for how many
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.520]   eggs you can
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.940]   buy.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.940]   And even
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.300]   Beijing,
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:34.780]   there were
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.180]   three or
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:35.940]   four blackouts
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.480]   per week,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.160]   typically.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.400]   There was a
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.200]   sense of
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.860]   community.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.640]   There was a
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.240]   very strong
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.560]   bond between
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.160]   people and
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:44.680]   within the
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.020]   family,
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:45.700]   because they
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.220]   were going
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:46.600]   after a
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.040]   common goal,
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:47.620]   making your
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.120]   life better,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.780]   struggling,
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.520]   striving to
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:49.840]   make your
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.320]   life better.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.260]   And I
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.200]   remember being
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.800]   on the back
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.240]   of my
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:53.860]   father's
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.380]   bike,
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.080]   getting up
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.140]   6 a.m.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.760]   every day
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.360]   and going
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.260]   to nursery.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.340]   And that's
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.160]   the typical
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.560]   day.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.640]   Not a lot
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.100]   of material
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.540]   goods,
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.280]   but people
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.880]   had a sense
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.440]   of purpose.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.020]   And that's
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:09.580]   radically
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.320]   different.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.280]   It's
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:11.880]   completely
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.440]   different now
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:12.820]   in China.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.580]   Do you
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.100]   think that
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   if you
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:15.340]   go to
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:15.660]   the human
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.140]   condition,
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.440]   do you
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:16.800]   think that
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.780]   nostalgia has
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.260]   some truth
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:18.560]   to it,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:18.860]   or is it
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.080]   just nostalgia
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.540]   like any
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:20.760]   other?
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.120]   Is there
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.900]   some aspect
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.200]   of an
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:24.760]   intense,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.480]   competitive,
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.020]   vibrant
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.200]   economy that
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.000]   loses some
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.440]   element?
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.500]   Absolutely.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.360]   Of everybody
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.060]   being poor
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.540]   together?
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.100]   Well,
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.100]   everybody having
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.900]   a common
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.740]   goal and a
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.380]   sense of
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.000]   community,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.380]   right?
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.360]   That is what's
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:38.900]   missing in
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.580]   these extremely
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.700]   individual-based
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.140]   capitalist
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:41.720]   societies.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.140]   And I
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.080]   think what
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.460]   the Chinese
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:43.940]   government is
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.760]   striving to
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.440]   do with
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.160]   Chinese
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.300]   socialistic
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.180]   characteristics
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.080]   is to
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.600]   somehow try
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.200]   to preserve
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.020]   a bit of
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:51.660]   that socialist
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.080]   character while
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.180]   still relying on
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.700]   markets,
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.460]   market-based
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:55.880]   incentives.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.120]   But if you're
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.600]   an extremely
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.840]   individual-based
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.780]   society, I
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.420]   think you do
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.540]   lose a lot
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:01.880]   of that.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.420]   And I think
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:02.920]   some of the
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.580]   backlash that
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.520]   we're seeing
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.960]   from society
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.620]   is a
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.240]   reflection of
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:07.480]   that,
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:07.860]   right?
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.720]   People being
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.560]   alone more
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:09.940]   and more,
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.960]   the death of
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.800]   despair in
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.480]   the U.S.,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.500]   the addiction,
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.380]   you know,
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.200]   that they're
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.640]   lonely,
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.240]   right?
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.360]   And competition
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.560]   means that you
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.160]   kind of have to
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:22.920]   be somewhat
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.520]   badass.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.300]   And you
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.020]   sometimes put
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.880]   down values
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.180]   and you
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.020]   forsake harmony
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.000]   in order to
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.440]   get ahead.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.260]   That's certainly
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:32.680]   the Chinese
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.280]   society now.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.840]   That was not
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.160]   the case
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.580]   before.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.200]   You think
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:35.540]   that's a
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:35.760]   natural
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.200]   consequence
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.060]   of capitalism
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:38.880]   almost always
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.620]   that you
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.240]   become more
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.620]   individualized,
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   you become
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:43.120]   lonelier,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.360]   you feel
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.240]   lesser if
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:46.720]   you're not
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.180]   winning,
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.440]   and thereby
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.880]   somehow that
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.460]   breaks down
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.000]   society,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.140]   community,
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.040]   more and
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.240]   more?
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.040]   I think
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.280]   it's a
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.640]   spectrum,
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.340]   right?
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.600]   And Europe
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.500]   is somewhere
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.420]   in between,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.300]   I'd say.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.260]   But Europe
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.240]   also is not
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.080]   as technologically
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.680]   innovative as
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.540]   the U.S.,
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.340]   but on a
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:07.900]   social level
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.300]   there is
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:08.780]   more social
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.440]   protection for
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:09.880]   the people,
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.520]   there is
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.080]   a stronger
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.580]   sense of
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.000]   community,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.940]   I'd argue.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.620]   It's not
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.120]   perfect.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.080]   Ultimately,
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:16.520]   it is a
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:16.860]   choice,
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.420]   and this is
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.040]   what I think
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.320]   China has to
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:19.760]   decide,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.160]   right?
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.080]   Do you want
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.680]   technological
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.820]   supremacy and
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.160]   radical
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.060]   breakthroughs?
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.660]   Well,
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.080]   yes,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.580]   if you do,
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.100]   then you have
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.600]   to tolerate
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.060]   that there
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.280]   are going
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.500]   to be
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.140]   some people
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.400]   who are
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:28.800]   going to be
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.540]   just going
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:30.980]   to be
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.260]   uncomfortably
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:32.900]   rich,
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.320]   right?
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:33.740]   Like in the
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.300]   United States.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.400]   You can't
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:35.980]   say that you
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.700]   detest the
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.620]   financial system
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.440]   for its
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:38.920]   greed,
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.440]   but then not
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:40.940]   accept the
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.640]   fact that it
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.440]   is what fuels
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.040]   innovation,
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.840]   right?
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.680]   Risky capital
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.760]   fuels
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.400]   uncertain
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.060]   investments,
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.960]   which allows
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.880]   for countries
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.260]   like the
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.900]   United States
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.080]   to be making
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.060]   these breakthroughs.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:55.660]   That's what
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.160]   China wants,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.620]   but at the
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.060]   same time,
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.000]   China can't
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.440]   tolerate these
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.320]   extremely rich
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.460]   people around
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:01.900]   and their
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.480]   power that
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.180]   is accrued
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.560]   to them.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.820]   They want
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.080]   to be a
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:07.520]   leader in
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.040]   technology,
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.400]   but then the
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.260]   financial system
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:10.820]   is not
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.520]   liberalized.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.460]   It's highly
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.740]   regulated,
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.940]   but there's
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.780]   also intervention.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.280]   Even if we
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.040]   look back at
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.160]   the French
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:19.780]   civil law
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.540]   versus the
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.160]   English
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.200]   common law,
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.820]   well,
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:23.380]   the former
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.100]   protects
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.620]   creditors,
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.900]   and the
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.660]   latter is
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.300]   more friendly
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.000]   towards debtors,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.560]   which gives
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:29.900]   them more
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.060]   breathing space
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.100]   to innovate,
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.660]   but also to
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.260]   fail and to
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:33.940]   innovate again.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.240]   And that makes
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:35.880]   a big difference.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.120]   So it's all
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:37.540]   about a
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:37.960]   spectrum,
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.780]   right?
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.440]   But you
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:39.840]   can't have
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.320]   it both
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:40.600]   ways.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.100]   We don't
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:42.840]   often enough
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.760]   have that
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.700]   nationwide
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.520]   conversation
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.220]   about what
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:46.660]   we want to
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.120]   be as a
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:47.420]   country.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.360]   There's just
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.120]   a group of
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.880]   people yelling,
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.560]   we don't
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.440]   want billionaires,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.380]   and another
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.620]   group saying,
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.240]   we don't want
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.400]   communists or
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:55.640]   whatever,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.160]   it's a very
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:56.940]   trivialized
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.500]   kind of
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.020]   chanting,
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.260]   but there
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.540]   is a
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:38:59.880]   balance,
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.380]   there is a
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:00.760]   spectrum,
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.120]   and you
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.500]   get to
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.020]   decide.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.080]   Do you
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:04.680]   like the
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.520]   nice things,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.240]   the nice
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.120]   toys?
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:07.500]   And the
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:07.980]   power that
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.400]   the U.S.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:08.760]   has.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.220]   And the
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:09.580]   power,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.420]   the geopolitical
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.740]   power,
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.300]   the military
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:11.820]   power,
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.200]   cultural power,
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.940]   influence on the
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.240]   rest of the
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:14.500]   world?
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:14.900]   Yeah,
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:15.340]   you get to
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:15.940]   choose which
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.540]   do you
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:16.800]   want.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.740]   So the
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.360]   first time
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.180]   you went
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.400]   to U.S.,
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:22.800]   what was
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.300]   that like?
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.920]   You mentioned
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.260]   Harvard.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:24.860]   how did
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.240]   that change
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:25.360]   your
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.740]   understanding
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:25.980]   of the
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.200]   world?
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.580]   Well,
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.220]   it's funny
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:29.600]   that we're
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.100]   talking about
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.560]   this now
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.180]   because I
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:31.740]   was able
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.180]   to go to
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.660]   the U.S.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.400]   on a scholarship
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.060]   to an American
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.480]   high school
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.600]   because the U.S.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.400]   at that time
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.680]   was open arms,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.440]   all open arms
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.220]   towards international
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:39.880]   students.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.440]   They kind of
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.280]   wanted to be
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.360]   the country
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.460]   that was
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.220]   going to
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:45.960]   educate
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.920]   the future
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.420]   leaders of
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:47.880]   the world
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.780]   and their
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.220]   elitist
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.360]   institutions
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.740]   like Harvard
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.800]   was really
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.440]   going to be,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.800]   you know,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.080]   they're the
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.520]   center of the
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:54.740]   world.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.660]   So they
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.160]   welcomed
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.140]   students like
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:57.460]   me and
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:57.660]   many,
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.380]   many others
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.280]   to be
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:39:59.660]   exchange
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.120]   students
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.700]   to study
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.240]   in the
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:01.700]   U.S.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.600]   and we
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:03.900]   thought,
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.400]   wow,
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.120]   we've never
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.640]   seen a
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.340]   more generous
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.000]   country.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.400]   And I
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:09.900]   was able
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.360]   to go
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:11.620]   to high
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.000]   school,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.560]   an American
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:12.880]   high school
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.120]   and live
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:13.380]   with an
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:13.620]   American
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.080]   family,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.860]   which was,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.820]   wow,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.520]   can I say
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.420]   a big
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.160]   change
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.060]   from China,
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.680]   not only
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.160]   because I
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:21.680]   was plucked
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.260]   from the
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:22.820]   Communist
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.760]   Youth League
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.180]   party and
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:25.720]   then straight
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.320]   to supporting
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.040]   their Democratic
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.520]   campaign
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.600]   because the
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.020]   host family
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.440]   was running
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.000]   for state
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.560]   attorney general
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:30.800]   in New
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.040]   York.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.640]   I was
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.040]   going to
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.240]   these
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:33.720]   conventions
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.300]   and handing
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:34.940]   out flyers
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.220]   and trying
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:35.480]   to get
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.800]   votes
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:35.940]   in,
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.240]   I don't
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:36.380]   know,
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.360]   in Chinatown
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:37.780]   or something.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.640]   But it
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.880]   was so
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.600]   interesting
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.680]   to see
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.200]   that's how
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.600]   the system
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.120]   worked.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.880]   But in
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.200]   the course
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.560]   of doing
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:46.940]   that,
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.740]   I realized
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.100]   that people
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.560]   had a very
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:49.940]   simplistic
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.500]   understanding
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.120]   about China.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:51.800]   And that's
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.260]   probably,
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.920]   even when I
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.720]   was 14,
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.600]   I decided
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.720]   that one
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.040]   thing I
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:58.480]   wanted to
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.520]   do was
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.180]   to
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.840]   dispel
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.480]   some of
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:02.680]   these
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:02.980]   deep
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.380]   myths
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:03.980]   about
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.380]   China
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:04.820]   because
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.220]   the
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.520]   China
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:05.840]   that
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.100]   they
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:06.420]   knew,
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:06.960]   and again,
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.400]   it was all
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:07.800]   the three
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   Ts back
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.140]   in the late
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.920]   1990s,
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.420]   Taiwan,
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.580]   Tibet,
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.560]   and Tiananmen
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:13.780]   Square.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.220]   That's,
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:14.780]   that's,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.700]   they thought
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.100]   about China,
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:16.500]   they thought
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:16.880]   about these
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.480]   three things.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.380]   And I was
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:18.500]   like,
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:18.640]   well,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:18.860]   that's
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.240]   strange
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:19.700]   because
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.320]   that's
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.060]   not how
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.800]   I'm
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.160]   feeling
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:22.660]   in China
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.140]   with all
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.460]   this,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.120]   you know,
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.980]   bidding for
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.520]   the Olympics
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.600]   before 2000
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.280]   and all
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:27.620]   these
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.140]   buildings
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:28.720]   going up
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.140]   and down,
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:29.520]   all this
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.020]   excitement
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.100]   about,
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:31.340]   you know,
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:31.920]   joining the
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.780]   WTO,
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.420]   all these
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.820]   radical
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.360]   reforms
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:34.700]   that are
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.840]   taking place
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.480]   and then
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:37.880]   all this
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.740]   effervescence
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.040]   that you
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.580]   feel in the
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:39.820]   air.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.620]   It's not
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.300]   GDP growth
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:41.860]   as numbers,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.360]   you actually
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.040]   see it.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.280]   I said,
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:44.760]   this is
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.220]   really,
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:45.760]   you know,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.160]   and they're
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:46.840]   describing China
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.220]   as if it
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.120]   was a place
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.440]   shredded
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.320]   white terror.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.660]   And so
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.100]   I thought,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:51.360]   hmm,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:51.860]   that's
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.320]   interesting.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.720]   There's a
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.100]   big gap,
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.220]   big gap
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:55.380]   of
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.900]   understanding.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.140]   And even
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:57.660]   today,
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.060]   that many
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.880]   years later,
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   people know
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.500]   China a little
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:03.840]   bit more,
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.200]   but the
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.480]   sentiment
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.020]   hasn't
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:05.480]   profoundly
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:05.860]   changed.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.260]   It's still
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:06.660]   the three
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.040]   Ts,
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:07.660]   I feel
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:07.960]   like.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.500]   Some
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:09.980]   variation
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.440]   of that.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.580]   So what
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.480]   about the
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:12.880]   level of
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.300]   misunderstanding
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.060]   of Chinese
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.320]   people of
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:15.880]   the West?
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.660]   Is there
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:17.140]   a similar
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.740]   level of
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.160]   misunderstanding
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.700]   the other
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.300]   direction as
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:19.480]   well?
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.560]   I don't
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.140]   think to
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.460]   the same
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:21.940]   extent,
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.380]   because
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:22.900]   there's
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.240]   Hollywood.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.820]   They can
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.120]   see
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.520]   daily
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:25.900]   American
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.240]   life,
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:26.620]   although
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.340]   it might
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:27.720]   not be
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.240]   totally
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.240]   realistic.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.940]   There was
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.720]   a huge
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.480]   amount of
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.040]   admiration
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.200]   of U.S.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.640]   technology,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.120]   innovation,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.480]   but also
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.920]   the American
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.260]   dream.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.800]   I think
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.340]   our
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.040]   newspapers,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   even though
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.400]   there's
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:44.760]   bias
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.300]   everywhere,
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.540]   is not
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.160]   focused only
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:48.700]   on reporting
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.080]   the really
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.700]   bad stuff
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.560]   and portraying
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:50.960]   a negative
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.640]   side.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.080]   I think
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.500]   these few
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:52.800]   years have
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.160]   been a little
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.320]   bit
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:53.680]   different,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.500]   but so
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:54.720]   many
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.160]   students
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:55.520]   went to
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.380]   the U.S.,
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:56.640]   right?
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.660]   So many
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.060]   people
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.680]   traveled to
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.420]   the U.S.,
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.480]   and this
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:00.740]   is an
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:00.960]   interesting
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.480]   thing.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.820]   I've
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.820]   rarely met
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.260]   an
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:04.700]   American
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.420]   who has
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.080]   been to
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.440]   China
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.540]   and who
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.420]   still goes
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.140]   on about
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.840]   how bad
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.500]   China is.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.820]   I think
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.640]   that going
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.240]   to China
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.060]   makes all
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:15.600]   the difference.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.300]   I feel
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.120]   that's one
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:17.520]   of the big
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.240]   gaps of
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.660]   my life
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:18.920]   that I
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.360]   need to
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.340]   alleviate
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:20.820]   is to
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.140]   travel
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:21.560]   in a
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.060]   real way
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.380]   for a
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:22.940]   long time
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:23.580]   to really
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.000]   experience
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.520]   the people
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:24.820]   and the
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.180]   cultures.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.440]   And China
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:26.840]   is a big
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.200]   place.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.060]   Go dig
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.580]   deep and
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.100]   don't just
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:30.320]   go to
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:30.760]   Beijing and
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.000]   Shanghai.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.840]   Let's go
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.220]   back to
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:34.740]   the economics.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.840]   So can
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.420]   you just
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.860]   dig a little
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.680]   deeper on the
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.800]   relationship in
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.460]   China between
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:41.940]   the government
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:42.220]   and the
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:42.800]   companies in
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.120]   the private
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.480]   sector?
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   So how
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.400]   much freedom
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.460]   do companies
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.040]   have?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.400]   Another big
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.100]   misunderstanding
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:50.680]   and a
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.000]   fundamental
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.020]   one is
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.040]   that people
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.960]   somehow think
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.280]   that the
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.240]   state suppresses
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:55.680]   the private
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.000]   sector.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.360]   It's not
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.280]   at all as
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.680]   simple as
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.040]   that.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.520]   For the
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:00.980]   most part,
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:01.380]   if we look
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:01.600]   at the
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:01.800]   local
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.300]   government's
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:02.600]   incentive
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.060]   system,
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.620]   they want
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.100]   to help
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.700]   the best
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:05.400]   private
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.420]   companies,
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.100]   which are
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:07.400]   the most
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:07.840]   promising,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:08.640]   because it
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:08.960]   makes them
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.360]   look good.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:09.800]   It adds
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.140]   to their
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.440]   GDP.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:10.840]   It adds
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.180]   to the
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:11.540]   jobs,
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.100]   investment.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.400]   They are
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.020]   so helpful
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.520]   to these
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:14.800]   private
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.220]   companies.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:15.640]   Actually,
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.980]   I know
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.440]   many of
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.380]   these local
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:18.700]   government
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.120]   officials
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.600]   working
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.380]   tirelessly
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.200]   day and
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:21.520]   night,
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.340]   especially
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.560]   in bad
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.080]   times,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.680]   to coordinate
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.500]   between debtors
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.400]   and creditors
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:27.900]   and to
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.840]   smooth out
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.120]   and to
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.280]   find
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:29.860]   relationships
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   with banks.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.660]   They want
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:31.860]   to help
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.260]   these private
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:32.640]   companies,
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.300]   because again,
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.420]   their incentives
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.700]   are aligned.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.460]   DeepSeek is
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:37.780]   a private
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.220]   company,
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:38.900]   by the way,
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.080]   so it
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.620]   has done
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.360]   the country
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.180]   proud,
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.440]   and why
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:43.880]   would the
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.300]   state want
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:44.760]   to go and
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.140]   suppress
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:45.680]   these private
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.100]   companies,
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.900]   which ultimately
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.500]   represents a
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:49.760]   beacon of
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.280]   success for
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:50.620]   China.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.020]   Now,
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:53.900]   on how much
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.420]   freedom they
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:54.820]   have,
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.380]   it's really
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.600]   ranged from
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.660]   too much
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.160]   freedom,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   that's part of
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:44:59.700]   the problem,
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.000]   where you have
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:01.920]   defense companies
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.640]   buying art
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.500]   auction houses,
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.480]   real estate
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.140]   companies like
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:05.940]   Evergrande
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.940]   buying soccer
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.480]   clubs,
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.940]   doing EVs,
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.120]   companies
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.920]   investing in
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.320]   real estate
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:13.640]   that has
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.440]   nothing to do
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:14.760]   with their
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.440]   core business,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.160]   that's how
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:16.700]   much latitude
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.180]   were given
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:17.600]   to private
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.060]   companies,
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:18.840]   and there
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.940]   were consequences.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.540]   They were
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.120]   not reined in.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:22.780]   And then you
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:23.300]   go to the
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.180]   other extreme
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.340]   where they're
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:25.700]   scolded,
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.780]   they're reprimanded,
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.720]   they're reined in,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.660]   and they're kind
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.420]   of folded into
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:29.840]   submission.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.600]   So that is
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   the whole
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.500]   spectrum.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.340]   You have the
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.120]   whole range.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.800]   But I guess
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.280]   what we're
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:35.940]   really getting
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.400]   at is it
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.020]   is a country
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.160]   that is
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.320]   moving from
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.000]   a no rule
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.660]   of law or
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.320]   very little
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.220]   rule of law,
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.020]   very immature
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:45.920]   markets to
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.700]   something that
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.640]   is being
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.400]   gradually
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.620]   established,
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.000]   bankruptcy laws,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.440]   you know,
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.640]   corruption laws,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.060]   rules and
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.480]   regulations on
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.360]   what's possible.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.800]   One interesting
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.940]   point is that
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.060]   in China,
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.320]   you ask the
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:05.960]   companies to
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:06.540]   innovate first,
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.240]   and then you
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.360]   regulate after,
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.160]   right?
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.520]   So that has
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.280]   led to things
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.040]   like P2P
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.960]   platforms,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.600]   you know,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.220]   it's led to
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:14.680]   lots of
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:14.940]   kind of
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.360]   financial
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.060]   innovations,
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:16.980]   some of
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.340]   which has
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.020]   actually been
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.220]   very helpful
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:19.720]   and good,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.620]   some of which
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:20.980]   have been
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.600]   disastrous.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.580]   But the
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.260]   intention to
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.300]   regulate after
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.700]   the fact is
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.820]   to really not
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.140]   slow down or
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:28.800]   hinder the
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.100]   innovation.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.520]   This is a
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:29.900]   very different
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.400]   approach from
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:30.740]   Europe.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.460]   You regulate
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:31.960]   first,
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.860]   and then,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.100]   you know,
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:33.980]   companies have
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:34.680]   to work around
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.000]   that.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.360]   So this is
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:37.960]   why Chinese
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.680]   economy is so
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.180]   complex.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:39.940]   you cannot
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.680]   reduce it
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.200]   to simply
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:41.600]   a statement
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.100]   saying the
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.680]   state is
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.400]   unhelpful for
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:43.840]   the private
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.520]   or something
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.140]   like that.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.780]   There are
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.440]   certain sectors
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:48.840]   where the
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   SOEs dominate,
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.240]   right, when it
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:51.540]   comes to
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.200]   national security
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:52.680]   in terms of
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.000]   energy.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.840]   But let's
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.480]   not focus on
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.040]   these few
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:55.500]   sectors.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.720]   By and large,
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.140]   most of the
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.960]   economy, if you
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.480]   actually admit to
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.040]   the fact that
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:01.560]   China is highly
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.180]   innovative and
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.100]   highly entrepreneurial,
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.140]   means that it
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.740]   must be the
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.600]   private sector that
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.160]   is driving the
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:06.340]   show.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.260]   Innovate
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:07.540]   first,
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.420]   regulate after,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.260]   really
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:09.700]   interesting.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.720]   I also,
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.820]   in my mind,
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.620]   am contrasting
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.260]   it with the
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:15.700]   way the
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:16.340]   Soviet Union
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.060]   and Russia
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.040]   since operated.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.020]   It doesn't
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:19.780]   sound at all
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:20.740]   like this
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.100]   model.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.040]   And it's
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:22.980]   interesting that
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.780]   countries that
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.160]   at least on
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:24.860]   the surface
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.140]   had a similar
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.040]   cultural
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:27.800]   communist
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.860]   problems,
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.420]   you know,
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.140]   the bureaucracies
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:30.820]   that form inside
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.600]   the communist
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:31.980]   state,
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.960]   it just seems
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.720]   that China
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.500]   broke away
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:35.920]   from that
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.300]   somehow,
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.140]   that don't
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.080]   understand exactly
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:38.860]   what happened.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.780]   In the West,
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.320]   they grouped
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.480]   these economies
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.880]   together as if
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.320]   they're the same
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:43.580]   thing.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:44.400]   No, it's not the
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:44.900]   same at all.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.520]   There's so many
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.000]   differences,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.320]   so much more
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:47.820]   flexibility.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.440]   You can have
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.000]   dynamic
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.920]   entrepreneurialism
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.440]   at the same
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.100]   time have
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:52.640]   socialist
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.620]   characteristics,
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.080]   and I think
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:54.620]   this is what
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.540]   China has been
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.680]   able to shape
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.260]   and mold,
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.660]   a unique model
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.680]   that balances
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.080]   between
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:00.480]   government
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.080]   industry,
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.280]   between
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.220]   state
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:03.780]   coordination
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.060]   and
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:04.360]   market
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:04.900]   mechanisms
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.660]   and
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:05.960]   between
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.760]   individualism
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:06.900]   and
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.480]   communalism.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.020]   It's not
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.340]   necessarily
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:08.780]   black and
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:08.920]   white.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.380]   You can have
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:09.920]   all these
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.400]   things
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.200]   at the
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.360]   same
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:11.680]   time.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.540]   So what
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:12.740]   are the
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.100]   pros and
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:13.440]   cons of
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:13.760]   being an
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.140]   entrepreneur
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:14.620]   in China
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:14.940]   versus
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.380]   the West?
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:15.720]   Like if
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:15.940]   you get
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.480]   a choice,
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.120]   you have
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:17.640]   a dream,
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:17.980]   you want
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.320]   to build
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:18.720]   epic
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.320]   things,
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.220]   and you
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:21.500]   get to
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:21.840]   choose
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.360]   where to
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:22.800]   start that
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.240]   business,
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:23.700]   what are
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.060]   the pros
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:24.480]   and cons
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:24.980]   of each
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.700]   path?
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.000]   In China,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.600]   the speed
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.260]   is just
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.300]   awe-inspiring.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.260]   You have
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:30.460]   a good
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:30.860]   idea,
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.580]   you implement
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.140]   it,
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.060]   you realize
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.340]   your dream
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:33.840]   very fast
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.200]   because there's
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.680]   also the
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.360]   support system,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:35.620]   right?
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.140]   The infrastructure
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:36.500]   there,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:36.960]   the digital
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.400]   infrastructure
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:37.680]   there,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.220]   the engineers
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:38.580]   are there,
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.000]   the talent
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:39.380]   is there,
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:39.600]   and they're
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:39.900]   cheap,
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.240]   and the
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:41.680]   market
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.240]   competition
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:42.760]   is there
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.340]   to keep
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.560]   you going.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.220]   The consumers
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.080]   give you a
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.260]   very,
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:46.820]   very fast
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.300]   feedback.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.460]   Look at
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:48.780]   Xiaomi,
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:49.460]   it was making
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.740]   phones and
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:51.420]   now it makes
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:51.860]   one of the
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.780]   world's best
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.520]   EVs.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.760]   270,000
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.340]   cars sold
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:55.760]   in one
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.020]   day.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:56.840]   a few
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.300]   days ago
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:57.840]   with a
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:57.960]   new
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.280]   model.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.160]   They were
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:48:59.720]   phone makers.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.800]   So there's
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.220]   an advantage
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.660]   to that,
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.300]   okay?
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.320]   But I
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:05.920]   would not
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.600]   feel safe,
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.520]   not because
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.700]   of danger
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.540]   of expropriation
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.100]   or nothing
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:11.680]   like that,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.240]   but the
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.740]   bankruptcy laws
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:14.080]   are not
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:14.340]   there,
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:14.780]   right?
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.720]   It's not
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.000]   necessarily
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.500]   always fair
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.060]   competition.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.480]   Things don't
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.520]   happen necessarily
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.300]   in an orderly
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:20.720]   manner.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.960]   If you have
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.460]   a competitor,
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.160]   you can have
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:23.800]   a very evil
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.180]   competitor,
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:24.600]   and evil
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:24.980]   competitors
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:25.640]   are there
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.340]   everywhere in
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:26.640]   China.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.820]   They would
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.580]   call the
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.000]   police on
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:29.100]   you,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:29.440]   put you
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:29.840]   in jail,
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.820]   spread false
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.400]   rumors about
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:31.600]   you.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.060]   Maybe that
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.660]   happens also
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.160]   in the U.S.,
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:33.720]   but there's
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.120]   a different
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.120]   level in
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.460]   China.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.560]   And also,
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.160]   the mold that
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.700]   you can have
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.260]   to protect
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:41.720]   yourself,
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.240]   the IP
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:42.760]   protection,
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.460]   right?
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.120]   That's much
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.700]   weaker in
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:45.360]   China because
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:45.700]   the legal
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.280]   system is
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:46.700]   not very
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.080]   effective.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.040]   You have
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:48.440]   a good idea
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:48.680]   you'll be
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:48.980]   copied.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:49.920]   And there's
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.520]   a lot of
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:50.820]   work.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.160]   You have
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.520]   to dine
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:52.900]   and wine
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.160]   with the
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:53.360]   local
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:53.820]   governments.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.220]   I mean,
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:54.940]   that's not
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:55.540]   allowed anymore,
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.060]   by the way,
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.120]   but you
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:57.560]   dine and
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:57.900]   wine,
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.900]   figuratively
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.360]   speaking,
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:49:59.640]   you have
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.200]   to have
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:00.460]   a very
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:00.620]   good
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.140]   relationship
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:01.620]   with them.
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:01.900]   That's
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:02.280]   a different
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:02.640]   kind of
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:02.960]   work.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.640]   the wine
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.220]   and dine
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.560]   and the
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:04.820]   evil
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.420]   competitors
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.360]   is an
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.720]   interesting
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.340]   challenge.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:07.800]   That,
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.760]   in some
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.500]   maybe distant
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:09.860]   ways,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.680]   akin to the
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.260]   problems of
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:11.640]   the Soviet
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.120]   Union.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.160]   I think,
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:13.440]   I guess,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:13.700]   in the
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.340]   United States,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.300]   there's
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.760]   less of
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.280]   that.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.600]   And I
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:17.900]   don't even
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.380]   know if
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.020]   that's
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:19.600]   based on
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.280]   laws,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.320]   because there's
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:21.900]   a lot of
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.440]   lawyers in
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:22.960]   the U.S.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.640]   that could
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:23.940]   do the
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.340]   same kind
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:24.680]   of evil
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.100]   competitor
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:25.580]   stuff
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.080]   technically.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:26.380]   That's
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:26.560]   true.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.240]   The potential
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:27.760]   negative
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.880]   ramifications
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.380]   are there.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.060]   But I
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.240]   think personal
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.340]   protection is
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:32.740]   a big
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.260]   difference.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.220]   If you
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:35.440]   make a
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:35.920]   mistake,
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.880]   if your
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.360]   company's
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:37.740]   not run
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.060]   well,
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:38.500]   you go
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:38.920]   to jail.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.540]   I think
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.660]   that the
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:40.860]   U.S.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.400]   is much,
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:41.780]   much more
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.140]   tolerant
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.420]   on
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:42.960]   entrepreneurship,
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.880]   entrepreneurs
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.660]   on failure.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.580]   Since
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.000]   we're talking
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:46.360]   about it,
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:46.700]   there was
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.880]   a lot of
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.280]   controversy
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:48.840]   around Jack
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.080]   Ma
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.000]   disappearing,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.800]   quote-unquote,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.340]   and reappearing
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:52.740]   a bit
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.300]   later.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:53.800]   And there's
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.940]   been rumors
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:55.540]   of some
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.180]   tense
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:56.760]   relationships
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.200]   that he
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:57.600]   has
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.120]   with the
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.020]   Chinese
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.540]   government.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.420]   What is
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:02.800]   important
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:02.940]   to
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:03.240]   understand
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:03.420]   about
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:03.580]   the
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:03.760]   whole
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.300]   situation?
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.420]   To what
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:06.660]   degree
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:06.900]   is it
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:07.340]   reflective
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.140]   of the
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:08.700]   issues
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.860]   entrepreneurs
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.500]   face in
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:10.740]   China?
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.000]   In the
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.080]   U.S.,
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:13.580]   capital
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.080]   controls
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:14.880]   politics,
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.720]   one could
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.040]   argue.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.440]   In China,
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.520]   it has to
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:18.760]   be the
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.060]   other way
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:19.360]   around.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.780]   Capital
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.680]   must be
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.240]   reined in
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.180]   by politics.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.440]   As part
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:24.640]   of the
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:24.980]   capitalist
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:25.520]   class,
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.180]   do not
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.200]   have the
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:27.460]   ambition
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.060]   to
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:28.860]   exceed
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.040]   the
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.380]   powers
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:29.520]   of
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:29.660]   the
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:29.980]   political
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.640]   class
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.540]   is
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:31.760]   really
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:31.960]   at
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.080]   the
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.300]   core
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:32.740]   of it,
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:33.260]   I'd
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:33.500]   say,
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:33.940]   the
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:34.140]   biggest
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.500]   difference
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:34.840]   between
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.140]   U.S.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:35.560]   and China.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.040]   There are
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:38.720]   important
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.460]   details
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.040]   that I
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.900]   think the
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.380]   West has
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.520]   not
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.580]   fully
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.160]   provided to
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.720]   the public,
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.620]   for instance,
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.440]   and financial,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.660]   as innovative
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.220]   as it
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.720]   was,
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.840]   was doing
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.100]   banking
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.180]   jobs
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:57.840]   without being
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.260]   regulated
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:58.640]   like a
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:58.880]   bank.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.780]   So,
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.120]   that obviously
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.220]   poses a
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.320]   host of
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.080]   financial
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:04.560]   stability
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.160]   questions
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.000]   and rules
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.580]   and regulations
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:07.940]   and so
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:08.160]   forth.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:08.320]   So,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:08.660]   the fact
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.200]   that IPO
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.160]   was halted,
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.240]   you could
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:11.640]   say that
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.080]   there were
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.840]   strong
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.840]   economic
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.340]   regulatory
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.080]   grounds
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.400]   for that.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.840]   But I
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.340]   think more
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:18.740]   broadly
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.420]   speaking,
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.540]   if you're
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.060]   an entrepreneur,
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.280]   part of the
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:22.760]   capitalist
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.380]   class,
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.120]   keep your
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:25.460]   head down,
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:25.920]   make money,
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.240]   and that's
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:26.540]   fine.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.320]   Right?
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.620]   Do some
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:29.000]   philanthropy.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.180]   There are
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.100]   also many,
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:31.880]   many other
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.680]   billionaires
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.440]   that are
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:33.880]   just fine,
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.460]   that are
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:34.920]   actually
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.880]   very much
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.620]   in favor
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.060]   of the
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:38.520]   political
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:38.980]   leadership,
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.160]   and they
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:41.420]   do their
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:41.700]   thing.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.320]   Now,
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:42.740]   I'm not
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.280]   saying what's
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:43.440]   right,
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:43.680]   what's
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:43.820]   wrong,
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.180]   it's just
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:44.620]   a very,
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.380]   very different
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.280]   culture and
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:46.480]   different
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:46.900]   country.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:47.900]   In the
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.400]   U.S.,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.160]   it's great
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:49.460]   to be
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:49.880]   colorful.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.620]   I mean,
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:50.820]   you have
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:51.080]   a very,
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.740]   very colorful
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.660]   president,
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:53.420]   he would
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.100]   never have
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:54.940]   been able
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.440]   to make
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.200]   it in
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:56.820]   China.
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.900]   You have
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.340]   the likes
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:58.820]   of Elon
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.200]   Musk,
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:52:59.800]   it's great
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.060]   to be
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:00.320]   different,
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:00.760]   it's great
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.400]   to stand
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:01.600]   out.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.220]   You do
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:02.660]   not want
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.120]   to stand
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:03.860]   out in
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.160]   China.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.160]   So the
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:06.540]   moral of
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.060]   the story
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:07.900]   is that
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.020]   the top
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:09.380]   leadership
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.080]   understands
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.660]   that it
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.280]   needs these
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:11.640]   top
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.180]   entrepreneurs,
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:12.860]   the likes
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.260]   of Jack
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:13.420]   Ma,
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.800]   and they
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.760]   have done
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.180]   so many
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.680]   great things
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.020]   for the
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:18.240]   country,
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:18.620]   even for
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.160]   the world.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.560]   But in
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:20.960]   China,
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.900]   garnering too
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.260]   much influence
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.020]   and power,
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.000]   even through
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.820]   social media,
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.760]   doesn't make
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.380]   you look that
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:30.680]   great.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.200]   It's not a
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:31.720]   good thing for
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.260]   you personally.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.340]   And there's a
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:33.960]   saying in
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.180]   China that you
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:35.540]   just don't want
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:35.860]   to be the
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.480]   tallest tree,
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.300]   right?
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:37.820]   The tallest
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.900]   tree gets
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:39.380]   the most
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:39.860]   wind.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:40.880]   So I
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.260]   don't agree
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:41.640]   at all
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.200]   with the
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.160]   Western
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:43.900]   conclusion
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.040]   that this
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:45.680]   anecdote,
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.300]   this story
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:46.760]   has meant
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.060]   that
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:47.620]   entrepreneurs
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.680]   don't want
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:48.840]   to be
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.240]   entrepreneurs
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:49.600]   anymore.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.000]   The young
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.580]   kids don't
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.180]   aspire to
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:51.580]   be people
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:51.980]   like Jack
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.080]   Ma.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:52.480]   That's not
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:52.760]   true at
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:52.980]   all.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.900]   The incentives
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.360]   are still
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:54.660]   there.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.800]   It's a
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.140]   different
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.060]   kind of
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:57.960]   rich elite
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.460]   class in
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:58.680]   China.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.460]   So on
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.020]   what
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.740]   dimensions
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:02.800]   do you
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.300]   think
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.520]   that the
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:04.940]   height of
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:05.320]   the tree
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:05.980]   is measured?
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.920]   Is it
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.700]   more about
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.420]   just mouthing
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.680]   off in
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.200]   public?
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   So can
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:13.680]   you still
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.140]   be the
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:14.360]   richest
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.000]   person in
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.720]   China and
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.760]   actually not
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.640]   clash with
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.000]   the state?
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:19.400]   Absolutely.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.560]   Don't be
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.300]   too outspoken.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.220]   Don't try
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.200]   to get too
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:23.700]   much attention
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.020]   and too
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:24.800]   much influence.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.100]   And just,
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:26.500]   you know,
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.140]   again, it's a
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:27.900]   cultural thing,
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:28.500]   but just keep
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:28.800]   your head
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.200]   down, be
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:29.720]   humble,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.480]   you know,
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.200]   contribute to
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:32.840]   society, do
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.420]   philanthropy,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.520]   work, collaborate
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:35.920]   with the
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.980]   government, and
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.600]   you're kind
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.120]   of okay.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.400]   So the
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.100]   signal the
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:40.400]   Jack Ma
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.360]   situation sends
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:41.800]   to the
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.180]   entrepreneurs
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:42.800]   in China
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.180]   is not
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.480]   don't be an
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:46.880]   entrepreneur.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.820]   It's more
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.260]   like don't
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:49.420]   be too
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:49.780]   colorful.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.460]   Don't be
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:50.960]   too colorful
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.440]   and colorful
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.560]   means you
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:52.800]   can be
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.480]   colorful about
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.260]   the technical
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:55.780]   details of
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.700]   your
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.320]   technology,
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   but don't
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:58.520]   be
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:58.820]   colorful
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.220]   about
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:54:59.780]   Xi Jinping
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.120]   and politics
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:02.820]   and just
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.360]   stay out.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.560]   Yeah, stay
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:04.920]   out of
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.840]   politics, but
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.420]   I just want
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:06.860]   to say,
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.020]   that said,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:08.660]   Jack Ma
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.960]   was really
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.620]   an emblem
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:14.320]   of extreme
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.940]   success,
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:15.920]   right, for
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.600]   China, and
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:16.980]   the Chinese
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.460]   entrepreneurs
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.160]   look up to
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.380]   him.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.800]   That's really
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.140]   important.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.580]   It was a
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.400]   signal that
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.080]   unfortunately
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.800]   was misconstrued
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.220]   by the
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:25.620]   side and
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.360]   also outside
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.320]   world, but
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:28.960]   it's laid a
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:29.580]   different path
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.160]   for what
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:30.400]   these
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:30.860]   entrepreneurs
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.380]   should be
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:31.640]   doing.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.460]   What do
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:32.600]   you think
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.080]   happened to
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:33.200]   him?
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.720]   He's now
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.420]   living in
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:35.780]   Japan.
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.480]   That's by
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:36.840]   choice.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.620]   By choice.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.980]   He's an
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.460]   extremely
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.140]   fascinating
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:40.680]   character.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.220]   If he were
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:42.500]   in the
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.600]   U.S., he'd
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.300]   thrive.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:45.420]   Funny,
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:45.880]   witty,
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.800]   smart,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.720]   wise,
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.980]   creative,
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.740]   loves a
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:51.320]   good life.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.080]   I think
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:53.540]   it's by
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.040]   choice that
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:54.500]   he's roaming
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:54.880]   around the
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.180]   world,
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.260]   given that
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:57.820]   he has
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.160]   more free
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:58.420]   time.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.220]   Do you
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:55:59.480]   think he
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.020]   loves China?
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.440]   All of
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:01.840]   them do.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.100]   All of
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.400]   them do
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.440]   because their
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.100]   lives,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.800]   their destinies
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.480]   were totally
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.060]   changed because
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.080]   of China,
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:10.620]   because of
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.060]   the government,
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:11.540]   because of
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.020]   Deng Xiaoping,
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.620]   because of
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.100]   everything.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.640]   I know a
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:15.840]   lot of
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.220]   people from
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:16.920]   the former
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.600]   Soviet Union
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.060]   and there's
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:18.400]   a deep
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:18.840]   resentment.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.440]   of
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.080]   broken
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:21.680]   promises,
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.420]   broken
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.040]   dreams.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.040]   So that
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.640]   is not
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.120]   something you
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:25.240]   see.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:25.500]   That's not
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:25.920]   how I would
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.720]   describe that
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.920]   generation and
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.500]   their feelings
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.500]   towards China.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.280]   Of course,
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:30.800]   you always get
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.260]   exceptions,
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:31.540]   right?
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:31.940]   The ones who
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:32.220]   have moved
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:32.440]   to the
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:32.760]   U.S.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.080]   and who
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.460]   wants a
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:34.980]   democracy,
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.740]   but by
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.360]   and large,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.480]   people are
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.000]   deeply
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.160]   grateful to
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.480]   China,
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.060]   the Chinese
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:40.480]   government,
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.320]   the Communist
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:41.720]   Party,
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.180]   if you want
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:42.520]   to label
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:42.800]   it as
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.040]   that,
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.520]   because they've
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.200]   seen their
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.240]   lives be
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:46.780]   totally
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.440]   transformed.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.040]   I mean,
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.580]   Jack Ma
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.220]   went from
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:49.680]   being a
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.180]   schoolteacher
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:50.880]   to becoming
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.320]   one of the
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:51.820]   most powerful
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:52.260]   people in
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:52.560]   the world.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:52.860]   I mean,
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.600]   if you
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.200]   didn't have
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:54.880]   China,
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.400]   how could
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:56.740]   that have
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.160]   happened,
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:57.500]   right?
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.700]   Can you
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.100]   speak to the
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:56:59.320]   thing you
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:56:59.720]   mentioned a
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.320]   few times,
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:00.940]   which is the
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.680]   difference in
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.020]   American versus
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:03.820]   Chinese or
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.400]   maybe Western
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.160]   versus Chinese
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.780]   approach to
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.320]   entrepreneurship,
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.680]   zero to one
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.340]   versus one
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:10.800]   to N?
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.620]   maybe can you
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.640]   explain that
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.620]   and what
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:15.900]   will it
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.180]   take for
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:16.520]   China to
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.980]   become a
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:18.640]   consistent
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.900]   zero to
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.820]   one innovator
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.500]   for the
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:21.820]   individual
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:22.280]   entrepreneurs
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.080]   to create
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:23.780]   totally new
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.000]   things versus
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:25.500]   doing the
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:25.800]   things you
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:26.260]   mentioned about
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:26.940]   speed and
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.320]   scale?
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:28.980]   the U.S.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:29.660]   will lead
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:30.120]   for some
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.140]   time on
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:31.940]   breakthroughs,
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.280]   on disruptive
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.120]   technologies,
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:34.920]   the zero to
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.820]   one technologies
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.800]   that ultimately
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:38.280]   change the
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:38.520]   world.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.980]   But
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.220]   innovation is
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:42.860]   a process.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:43.720]   It goes from
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.280]   invention to
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.120]   production and
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:46.980]   commercialization
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:47.620]   and diffusion,
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.900]   diffusing
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.500]   technology
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.200]   throughout all
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:50.720]   parts of the
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.060]   economy.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.100]   And on those
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:52.780]   two stages,
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.400]   I think that
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:53.840]   China has a
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.480]   unique advantage,
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.060]   even if it
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:56.780]   still can't do
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:57.200]   the zero to
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.040]   one breakthroughs.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.120]   because in
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:57:59.520]   the end,
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.220]   how much
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.020]   this technology
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.200]   is adopted
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.540]   by the
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.180]   countries and
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:04.780]   by the
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.400]   various parts
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:05.620]   of the
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.280]   economy is
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:06.980]   fundamentally
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.100]   crucial to
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:08.500]   how much
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.220]   productivity will
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:09.880]   be unleashed.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.900]   And China's
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.220]   innovation
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.060]   currently,
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.440]   the DeepSeek
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.260]   is really one
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:16.940]   example, and I
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:17.260]   think it's
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:17.660]   really the
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.720]   beginning of
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.940]   the scale-based
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:20.900]   leading-edge
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.740]   technology,
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:22.940]   cost-cutting
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.160]   driven kind
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:24.920]   of innovation
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.420]   model,
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.460]   could be
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.280]   just as
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:27.700]   powerful
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:28.760]   maybe even
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.420]   more effective
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.380]   and powerful
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.160]   than the
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.940]   breakthroughs.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.520]   And it's a
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:33.940]   very different
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.260]   approach to
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:35.820]   innovation.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:36.780]   The Chinese
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.440]   companies focus
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.980]   on solutions,
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.020]   problem-solving.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:41.760]   Again, that comes
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.160]   back to the
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:42.960]   education system,
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.160]   right?
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:43.740]   You're giving a
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.680]   problem, I'm
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.040]   going to find
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:45.560]   the answer,
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.300]   the Chinese
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:46.780]   students can
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.080]   do it.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:47.860]   You want
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.400]   them to
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.540]   write their
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.300]   own question,
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:50.780]   they can't
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.180]   do it,
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:51.420]   right?
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.140]   I'm exaggerating
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:52.540]   a little bit,
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:52.940]   but it's a
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.320]   little like
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:53.740]   that, right?
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:54.240]   They see a
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:54.480]   problem,
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:54.780]   they're going
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:55.340]   to go after
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:55.600]   and they're
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:55.860]   going to find
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.180]   the best
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:56.580]   solution.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:58.740]   And that's
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.100]   really, really
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:58:59.740]   useful, right?
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:00.480]   Because we
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.180]   don't need,
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.020]   or developing
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:02.800]   countries especially,
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.060]   don't need these
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:04.900]   frontier technologies
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.460]   that they can't
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:05.720]   use.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.540]   And China
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.160]   currently has
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.060]   this AI
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.340]   plus program,
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:10.920]   which is about
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.460]   pushing AI
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.360]   into every
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.620]   single plausible
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.080]   sector with
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.020]   the help of
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:16.500]   the state.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.160]   So, adoption
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.360]   diffusion is
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.120]   very important.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.360]   Why China
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.040]   can't do
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.140]   breakthroughs or
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:24.620]   can't do
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.420]   zero-to-one
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.540]   technologies,
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.740]   I think,
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.680]   at the root
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.020]   of it,
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:29.640]   and there are
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.540]   some deeper,
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.780]   we talked
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.300]   about the
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.900]   proximate
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.860]   reasons,
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.580]   the short,
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:35.980]   flat,
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:36.380]   fast,
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:36.860]   for instance,
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.320]   right?
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.220]   You don't want
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:38.840]   to spend too
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.620]   much time on
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.360]   investigating
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.180]   something that
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:41.640]   you don't even
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.240]   know if it's
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.260]   commercially viable.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.840]   So, basic
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.660]   research is still
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.640]   weaker than in
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.320]   the U.S.,
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:47.920]   universities,
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.980]   but also this
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.680]   kind of intrinsic
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.380]   motivation.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.080]   It's very
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:51.440]   different,
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:51.680]   right?
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.420]   In China,
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.040]   it's driven by
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.720]   extrinsic
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.200]   motivation.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.000]   You are
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.720]   rewarded by,
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.300]   you know,
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.260]   compensation,
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:58.800]   financial
[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.320]   compensation,
[00:59:59.320 --> 00:59:59.840]   all these
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.540]   kind of
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.100]   extrinsic
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:01.800]   motivation is
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.280]   what drives
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:02.420]   you,
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.460]   but intrinsic
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.160]   motivation,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.820]   pursuit of
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.340]   knowledge for
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:05.800]   knowledge's
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.080]   sake,
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:06.960]   right?
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.280]   That was
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.740]   deep in the
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.400]   Confucius
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.080]   philosophies,
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.580]   but of course,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:09.840]   you know,
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.580]   poverty has
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.100]   changed all
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:11.400]   that.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.700]   The profound
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.400]   commitment
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.300]   commitment to
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.440]   scholarship to
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.000]   research,
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.200]   which we know
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:17.920]   is very much
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.260]   true in the
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:19.540]   U.S.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.220]   universities,
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.180]   that's,
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.120]   it's starting,
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:22.840]   it's starting,
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.380]   but it's not
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:23.660]   there.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.200]   So,
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.060]   I think these
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:26.720]   two approaches
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.140]   are actually
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.780]   quite compatible
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.240]   with each
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:28.440]   other.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.060]   I don't know
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:29.680]   what all this
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.460]   fuss is about,
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:30.840]   right?
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.260]   China uses
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.140]   technology very
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.400]   well,
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.040]   can scale up
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.680]   and reduce
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.180]   costs,
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:36.820]   and then it
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.360]   can spread it
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:37.820]   around,
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.280]   and the U.S.,
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:39.500]   you know,
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:39.760]   has,
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.740]   makes the
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.440]   highest value
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.100]   added by
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:42.640]   inventing
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:42.840]   these
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.460]   technologies,
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.080]   but,
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:45.520]   you know,
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.280]   again,
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.820]   diffusion
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.240]   matters.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.100]   Well,
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:48.300]   yeah,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:48.880]   the things
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.220]   you mentioned,
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.120]   the scale,
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.320]   the manufacturing,
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.240]   the diffusion,
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.720]   from a sort of
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.620]   economics perspective,
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.640]   you wonder which
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.140]   is the more
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.040]   important skill
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:58.540]   to have,
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:58.980]   and it seems
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.040]   like the
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.480]   cost-cutting,
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.100]   the efficient,
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.860]   large-scale,
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.060]   fast manufacture,
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.340]   the diffusion
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.200]   is much more
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.180]   important for the
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:09.800]   success and the
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.220]   growth of the
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:10.580]   economy.
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.480]   I think
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:11.880]   where it
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.820]   ultimately leads
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.500]   to an impact
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.020]   on the
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:14.440]   economy,
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.460]   that's
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.120]   more important.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.280]   It's this
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.560]   persistent question
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.080]   we have,
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.620]   why don't we
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.080]   see the
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.680]   productivity in
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.080]   the numbers,
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:23.840]   right?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.880]   You're in
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.220]   AI.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.780]   AI,
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.300]   we had
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.240]   long periods
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:27.860]   of investment,
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.340]   right?
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:28.600]   You just
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:28.980]   don't,
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.380]   you haven't,
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:29.840]   you hadn't
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.380]   seen it in
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:30.800]   the numbers
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.460]   until maybe
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.000]   even recently,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.240]   and it's
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:32.620]   still very
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.000]   slow.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.040]   But China's
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:34.680]   pushing that
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.880]   in the sectors,
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.220]   you know,
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.780]   robotics,
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.380]   AI,
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.100]   cloud,
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:39.900]   industrial
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.500]   internet of
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:40.980]   things,
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.640]   and even
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.200]   companies like
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.440]   Huawei,
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.080]   I think it's
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.620]   gotten a little
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.940]   bit too bad
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.660]   of a rep
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.940]   in the U.S.,
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.140]   but American
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:49.920]   engineers working
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.400]   for Huawei
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.180]   said that it's,
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:51.520]   you know,
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.120]   they're so happy
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:52.580]   working for
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:52.900]   Huawei.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:53.640]   The intent
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.560]   focus on
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.020]   innovation,
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:55.640]   but also on
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.680]   solution-driven
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.100]   innovations in
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:58.500]   Africa,
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.380]   in rural
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:01:59.960]   areas,
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.600]   really changes
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.180]   people's lives.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.500]   It doesn't
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:01.880]   change the
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.080]   world,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:02.760]   but it changes
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.320]   individuals'
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:03.840]   lives.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:04.960]   What's
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.180]   the feeling
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.480]   that Chinese
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:07.980]   entrepreneurs
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.880]   have about
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.400]   copying
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.280]   technology?
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.620]   Because I
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.180]   think one
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:12.420]   of the
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:12.680]   cultural
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.220]   things in
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:13.860]   the U.S.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.120]   is just
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:15.600]   really not
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.320]   respected if
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:16.800]   you copy.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.720]   So,
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:17.880]   like,
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.280]   that's not
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:18.760]   seen,
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.280]   that's seen
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:19.660]   as a big
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.120]   problem.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.380]   And is
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:22.740]   there some
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.140]   degree to
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.400]   where in
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:23.940]   China it's
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.240]   not?
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.180]   No,
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:25.800]   unfortunately,
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.160]   this is a
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.620]   big cultural
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.200]   difference.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.540]   Our sense
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.580]   of property
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.780]   rights is
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:33.420]   actually quite
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.020]   different from
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:34.460]   the U.S.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:34.760]   I think
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.100]   that will
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:35.580]   change over
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.020]   time,
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.180]   but absolutely
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:37.880]   you're right.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.440]   They have no
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:40.980]   qualms about
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.680]   copying as
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.020]   long as it
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:42.340]   leads to
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:42.720]   success,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:42.920]   right?
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.280]   That's the
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:43.800]   difference in
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.280]   values.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.240]   As we
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:46.640]   mentioned in
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:46.880]   the beginning,
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.420]   you asked
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.800]   why the
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.180]   level of
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:49.760]   competition is
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.300]   so fierce.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.200]   Well,
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.260]   they all do
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:52.560]   the same
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.000]   thing once
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.500]   they've seen
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.360]   one successful
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:54.600]   thing,
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.140]   everybody does
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:55.500]   the same
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:55.760]   thing.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.500]   You'd have
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.060]   no respect
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.540]   for doing
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:57.920]   that in
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.460]   the U.S.,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:58.740]   right?
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:02:59.580]   But in
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:02:59.920]   China it's
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.280]   all fine.
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.580]   But I
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.100]   think that over
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:02.700]   time it will
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.020]   change.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:03.560]   Just give it
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:03.780]   a little
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.060]   bit of
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.240]   time.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.120]   So do you
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:05.520]   fundamentally
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.060]   it's a bad
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.420]   thing?
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.280]   In the end,
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.360]   if China is
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:09.680]   all about
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.120]   innovation
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.760]   technology,
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.940]   you cannot
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.100]   not have
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:13.880]   very strict
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.840]   IP protection,
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.940]   right?
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.220]   And ultimately,
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:17.780]   again,
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.700]   we're still in
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.020]   the short,
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:19.440]   flat,
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.680]   fast stage,
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.120]   right?
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:22.840]   When we
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.880]   graduate from
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.880]   that stage,
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.300]   you're going
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:25.700]   to have very
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.540]   different views
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.120]   about these
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:27.400]   things.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:27.740]   You're going to
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.160]   try to
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:28.740]   diversify and
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.180]   do different
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:29.620]   things.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:30.180]   But again,
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:30.960]   it's a stage.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.840]   Chinese people
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.360]   were hungry.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:32.940]   They're still a
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.180]   little bit
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:33.440]   hungry.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.820]   They're not
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.100]   going to be
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:34.560]   as hungry
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:34.960]   in the
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.260]   future.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.660]   So can you
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.080]   describe the
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:37.840]   DeepSeek moment
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.900]   and DeepSeek
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.640]   as it represents
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.260]   what China is
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:40.660]   thinking about
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.000]   in the space
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:41.320]   of AI?
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.300]   And does
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.580]   China have
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.140]   a chance
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.900]   at outrunning
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.400]   US in the
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.060]   AI race?
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.060]   DeepSeek was a
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.940]   surprise to the
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.700]   world, but I
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.260]   don't think it
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.260]   was that much
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:54.920]   of a surprise
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.620]   to the same
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.000]   degree to
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.060]   the Chinese.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.640]   And remember
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.320]   that DeepSeek
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.200]   happened in
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.240]   times of
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.220]   crisis,
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:05.920]   urgency,
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.440]   not in
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.120]   times of
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:07.620]   comfort.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.460]   A lot of
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:09.860]   these
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:10.500]   technological
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.520]   breakthroughs
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.760]   and leapfrogging
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.340]   happens in
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:14.720]   times of
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.000]   crisis.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:15.360]   This is
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:15.900]   called crisis
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.420]   innovation.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.480]   And you
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:17.680]   got to
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:17.980]   thank the
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.420]   US for
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:18.700]   that,
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.460]   right?
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.380]   When the
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.080]   Chinese were
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.000]   comfortably
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.660]   importing chips
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.060]   from the
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.840]   US, the
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.540]   whole industry
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.080]   stalled for
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:26.580]   20 years.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.580]   I mean,
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:27.880]   why would
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.280]   you plow
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:28.800]   in billions,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.220]   tens of
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:29.440]   billions,
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:29.800]   and even
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.440]   more when
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:30.660]   you can
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.400]   just import
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:31.880]   the best?
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.660]   You don't
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:32.980]   want to do
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:33.240]   your own
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:33.820]   innovation.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.220]   It's because
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:35.580]   of these
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.440]   export controls,
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.860]   these sanctions
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.380]   on these
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.060]   companies that
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:39.900]   Chinese companies
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.220]   in the
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:40.860]   Chinese state
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.020]   felt an
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:42.580]   existential
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.200]   crisis a
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:44.940]   few years
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.520]   ago by
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.800]   being cut
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.220]   off from
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:48.680]   these critical
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.160]   components.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:49.520]   And guess
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.000]   what happened?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:50.700]   In a short
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.060]   amount of
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:51.540]   time, the
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.600]   degree of
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.100]   domestic
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.560]   capacity ramping
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.220]   up and
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:55.740]   catch up
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.700]   has been
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.480]   nothing short
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.160]   of remarkable.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.380]   Again, thanks
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.480]   to US
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.640]   truculence on
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.240]   technology.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.900]   Now, I'm
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.200]   sure there
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:05.680]   are many
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.260]   aspects of
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.380]   hyperbole
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.140]   related to
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:08.720]   DeepSeq,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.040]   but it just
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.680]   shows you
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.620]   that the
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.260]   gap is much
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.440]   smaller between
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:13.960]   China and
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.100]   the US on
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:15.500]   leading-edge
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.300]   technologies than
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:16.580]   what was
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.600]   expected, that
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.260]   these export
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:18.940]   controls were
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:19.500]   not effective,
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.460]   they may have
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.220]   even backfired.
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.440]   And it
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:22.840]   shows you
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.380]   that China
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.100]   has this
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:25.680]   relentless
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.500]   focus on
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.060]   taking some
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:28.360]   of the
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:28.820]   existing
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:29.540]   technologies
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.380]   and using
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.680]   scale and
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.680]   the
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.800]   advantages to
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.580]   cut cost
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.280]   and to
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:38.700]   diffuse.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.220]   And this
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:40.940]   is just the
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.260]   beginning.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:41.860]   I think it
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.480]   will happen in
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:42.920]   many other
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.600]   industries as
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.220]   well, including
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.120]   in semiconductors.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.860]   And that's
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.220]   the Chinese
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:47.660]   approach.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.440]   Now, there's
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.360]   an interesting
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.320]   dilemma here,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.340]   which is that
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.360]   this is happening
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.820]   in a time of
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.180]   extreme economic
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:58.800]   softness,
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.880]   slowdown,
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.780]   and missed
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.620]   uncertainty,
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.680]   trade wars,
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.140]   a lack of
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:07.660]   confidence,
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.600]   a slowdown in
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.320]   private investment
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:10.960]   and consumption,
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.880]   a withdrawal of
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.540]   foreign investment
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.160]   from China,
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:14.940]   especially the
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.900]   US venture,
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.120]   funding.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.160]   Imagine what
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:20.860]   China would
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.520]   have been like,
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.480]   let's say,
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.140]   if the economy
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.860]   was doing better,
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.540]   right?
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.540]   But you could also
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.500]   argue that it's
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.520]   because people
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.180]   feel threatened
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.000]   that they make
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:29.820]   more leads.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   Now, I wish
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.600]   the world is not,
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.660]   we don't have to,
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:32.920]   you know,
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.880]   drive each other
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.580]   to the corners
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:35.580]   to do something
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.080]   great,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.120]   but that is the
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:37.560]   reality.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.800]   And I don't
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   think that there's
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.400]   an easy say
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.260]   between who wins
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:42.700]   because I think
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.760]   the winning idea
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.740]   is part of the
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.420]   old playbook.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.240]   right?
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.020]   You're all kind
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:47.620]   of part of a
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.040]   network.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.420]   Different countries,
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.100]   different players
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:50.620]   have different
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.300]   choke points on
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.740]   each other.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.540]   I don't think
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.040]   it's just about
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:53.600]   the US and
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:53.920]   China.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.720]   And what's
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.100]   more,
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.740]   you use your
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.560]   leverage once
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.900]   and that leverage
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.860]   has a half-life.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.620]   It becomes a lot
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.500]   less effective the
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.120]   second time around
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.620]   because other
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.060]   countries,
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:06.660]   other companies
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:06.960]   are going to
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.520]   try to substitute
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:07.880]   it away.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.620]   You know,
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.840]   if China uses
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.840]   the rare earth
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.480]   leverage,
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.400]   which I think it
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.140]   is now a
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:13.660]   little bit,
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.380]   there will be
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.120]   alternatives and
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:17.700]   substitutes.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.880]   Got to be very,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.180]   very careful of
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.020]   what coercion
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:21.800]   leverage means.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.300]   Same thing with
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:22.800]   the US,
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.560]   right?
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.740]   So I think this
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.700]   is all the old
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.520]   thinking of who
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:26.760]   wins,
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.460]   who dominates.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.020]   I think we need
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:28.900]   a new playbook.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.280]   So to you,
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.440]   maybe when you
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.060]   refer to Biden
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:32.520]   and Trump,
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.460]   if you go back
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:33.860]   to Biden,
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.380]   it would be the
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:34.900]   CHIPS Act.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.260]   So the export
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.100]   controls created
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.040]   unintended,
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.820]   unexpected effect
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.400]   where it had
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.100]   the reverse
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.880]   geopolitical effect.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.040]   I hope it was
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.640]   unintentional,
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.620]   otherwise you'd
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.360]   be questioning
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360]   the level of
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.180]   intelligence of
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:48.560]   the US
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.380]   administration,
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:49.840]   right?
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.780]   But I think
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.920]   that the things
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.380]   they laid out
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:54.980]   did the opposite
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.880]   of what was
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.300]   intended.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.760]   It sped up
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.240]   domestic capacity.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.400]   It motivated
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.000]   the whole country
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.500]   to do this
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.020]   whole of a
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.620]   nation program
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.180]   to go after
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:07.720]   technology.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.160]   It's kind of
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:08.580]   like the way
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.080]   they go after
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.540]   Olympics,
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.260]   right?
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:10.840]   Olympic gold
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.140]   medals.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:11.520]   They wanted
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.160]   to maximize
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.180]   Olympic gold
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:13.600]   medals and
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.020]   they put the
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.560]   whole nation
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.080]   at work and
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.760]   all the resources
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.100]   and that's
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.420]   what China
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:16.740]   did.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.580]   Huawei,
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.460]   another example,
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:18.860]   they were
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.520]   sanctioned.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.440]   Guess what?
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.560]   They have
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.200]   come back to
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.100]   life stronger
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:23.660]   than ever
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.140]   before.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.900]   And this is
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.600]   not unique to
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.220]   this episode.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:27.700]   If we look
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:28.580]   throughout history,
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.820]   these blockades
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:30.400]   don't work.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.160]   The continental
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.960]   system actually
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.400]   indirectly led
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.640]   to industrial
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.520]   revolution in
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.160]   the UK when
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.740]   the Spanish
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.020]   kind of
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:43.780]   blockade the
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.300]   Portuguese,
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:44.960]   they came up
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.540]   with a very
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.140]   ferocious,
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.440]   forceful naval
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:47.880]   power.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.460]   And you're
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:49.800]   talking about
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.320]   China here.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:50.760]   They just
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.620]   don't lie
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:52.260]   down and
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.040]   lie flat and
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.560]   say, oh,
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.280]   we give up,
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:54.780]   right?
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.820]   They're more
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.700]   motivated than
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.260]   ever before.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:08:59.940]   So the
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.740]   lesson is
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.780]   don't force
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.860]   people or
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.600]   nations into
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.060]   a corner.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.380]   You make
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:08.780]   them have a
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.360]   very comfortable
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.320]   situation and
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:10.980]   they tend to
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.460]   become complacent
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.900]   and they
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.660]   stagnate.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.040]   All right.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.860]   So can you
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.660]   talk through
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.820]   the whole saga
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.720]   of the Trump's
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.260]   tariffs that's
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.180]   still going on,
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.400]   especially tariffs
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:24.920]   on China,
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.980]   from your
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.740]   perspective as an
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.160]   economist?
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.280]   To what degree
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:28.580]   was it
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:28.980]   justified?
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:29.620]   To what degree
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:29.940]   was it
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:30.300]   effective?
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.440]   To what degree
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:31.880]   is it bad
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.380]   policy?
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.760]   For U.S.,
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.460]   for the West,
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.760]   for the world,
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.860]   also for China.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:38.840]   You know,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.740]   China has been
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.460]   preparing for
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:40.980]   this for the
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:41.880]   last five years
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.900]   and for the
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.360]   return of
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.300]   Trump and
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.360]   for Trump's
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.240]   maniac trade
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:49.780]   policies.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.960]   You'd think
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.480]   that Trump
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.320]   also had five
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:52.860]   years to
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.480]   prepare for
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.000]   this battle
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:54.600]   with China.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.000]   It didn't
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.240]   show.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:58.880]   you can
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.720]   say that
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.120]   the Chinese,
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:01.920]   at least this
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.540]   time around,
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.180]   have played
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:03.500]   their hand
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:03.980]   pretty well
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.180]   when dealing
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.740]   with Trump's
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:07.500]   tariff threats
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.140]   and the trade
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:08.420]   war.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.400]   With a level
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.160]   of calibrated
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:11.920]   assertiveness,
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.700]   they have really
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.160]   thought through
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:13.840]   everything very
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.500]   elaborately.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.380]   And look,
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:17.940]   you know,
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.020]   this is not good
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:19.680]   for either country.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.280]   Let's just be
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:20.520]   clear.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.320]   It's bad
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.880]   for U.S.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.220]   and China,
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:23.740]   and it's
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:24.620]   bad for the
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:24.980]   world.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.860]   And every
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.080]   country has
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.000]   a stake in
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.100]   the U.S.-China
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.020]   trade war
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.220]   because whether
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:31.800]   you trade
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.540]   directly or
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.240]   indirectly with
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:33.440]   China,
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:33.720]   you're going
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:33.880]   to be
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.220]   affected.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.340]   They are
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:35.760]   one of the
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.120]   largest
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.880]   intermediate
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.920]   exporters
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.420]   in the
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:38.820]   world,
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.860]   and Chinese
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.640]   manufacturing
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.080]   goods anchor
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:43.860]   global
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:44.660]   manufacturing
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.140]   prices.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.740]   the cumulative
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:48.900]   tariff
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:49.660]   burdens,
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.360]   when you get
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:50.800]   to Canada,
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.180]   when you get
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:51.580]   to Mexico,
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:51.980]   when you get
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.300]   to any
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   other final
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.000]   destination,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   these tariffs
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.180]   will affect
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:57.460]   you,
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.160]   right?
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.100]   So it's
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.120]   clearly very,
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:00.760]   very bad
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.420]   for the
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:01.720]   world.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.260]   China's
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.520]   core principles,
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.400]   and I think
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.000]   that this is
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:07.380]   not well
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:07.740]   understood
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.040]   from the
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:09.360]   rest of
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:09.800]   the world
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   towards the
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.400]   U.S.,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.000]   and something
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.340]   that they
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.200]   have kept
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.080]   up is
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.900]   equivalence,
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.000]   reciprocity,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.140]   and realism.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:18.600]   China's not
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:18.960]   going to lower
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.500]   tariffs unless
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:19.900]   the U.S.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.200]   does,
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:20.720]   right?
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.840]   You can kind
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.400]   of stand up
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:22.780]   to Trump
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.340]   like a man.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:23.740]   That's the
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:24.240]   only way,
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:24.500]   you know,
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:24.980]   to deal with
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.200]   Trump.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:25.700]   That's its
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:25.980]   view.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:28.860]   The deal
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:29.300]   has to be
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:29.760]   realistic.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.360]   The phase
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:30.780]   one deal
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.220]   of the last
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.120]   time wasn't
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:32.460]   realistic,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.160]   and China
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:33.520]   thinks,
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:33.780]   look,
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.100]   the U.S.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:35.340]   is going
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.120]   to use
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.400]   this as
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:36.880]   leverage,
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.640]   right?
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.420]   That's not
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.300]   possible.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.180]   This can't
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:40.860]   be seen as
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:41.580]   political
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.200]   concession.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.480]   The deal
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:43.960]   has to be
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.360]   seen as
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:44.620]   mutual
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.020]   commerce,
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.020]   so where
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.240]   China can
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:48.980]   have room
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.820]   to negotiate
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.860]   is opening
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:51.300]   up things
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:51.960]   like services,
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.380]   you know,
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.460]   American banks,
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:54.220]   American financial
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:54.900]   institutions have
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.260]   a lot of
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:55.800]   business to do
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.220]   in China.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.380]   They can buy
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:57.900]   a limited
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:58.460]   number of
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.220]   more goods.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.300]   They can
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.100]   discuss about
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:01.920]   transparency
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.360]   around rules
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.120]   and regulations
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.020]   on e-commerce,
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:05.320]   on data,
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:05.880]   all that is
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.200]   fine.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.000]   But don't
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:08.860]   confound
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.020]   economic issues
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:10.520]   with political
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:10.980]   issues.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.000]   Hong Kong,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:12.760]   Taiwan is not
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.160]   part of
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:13.500]   the deal,
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.080]   by the
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:14.280]   way,
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:14.780]   in case
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.320]   anyone was
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:15.680]   wondering.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.440]   Trying to
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:17.900]   change
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:18.640]   China's
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.540]   state-hybrid
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.300]   private-sector
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:20.760]   model,
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.620]   don't go
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:21.880]   there.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.900]   Anything that
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.460]   challenges
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.300]   China's
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:25.880]   technology,
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.680]   security,
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.200]   that's not
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.560]   really part
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:28.740]   of the
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.120]   discussion.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120]   I think
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.780]   that people
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.340]   have to be
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.320]   clear about
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:32.860]   also what
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.000]   China thinks
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.120]   and wants,
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.440]   and also the
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:36.960]   Chinese to be
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.240]   clear about
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:37.640]   what Trump
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:37.860]   wants,
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.220]   although I
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:38.820]   don't know
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.240]   anybody,
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:39.840]   even Trump
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.140]   himself
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:40.400]   knows
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:40.780]   exactly
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:41.100]   what he
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.420]   wants,
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.720]   in order
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.900]   for these
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.100]   very complex
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:45.900]   negotiations
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.580]   to actually
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.020]   succeed.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:47.760]   Okay,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.880]   so China
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.800]   has a few
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.520]   red lines,
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.100]   so don't
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:52.680]   mention Hong
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.080]   Kong or
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:53.460]   Taiwan.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.840]   Don't mix
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.560]   the political
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.840]   issues with
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.440]   the trade
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:57.640]   deal.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:57.980]   Right,
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:58.820]   and then
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.260]   is there
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:12:59.780]   some degree
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.160]   maybe you
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:00.460]   can speak
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.100]   to culturally
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.600]   where
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.540]   stylistically
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.460]   there's
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.140]   red lines
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.220]   meaning
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:07.700]   don't
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.000]   bully
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.600]   China
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.660]   like
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:10.140]   language
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:10.600]   wise
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.740]   or
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:11.900]   does
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.080]   that
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.360]   not
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:12.740]   matter
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.640]   because
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.200]   there's
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:14.500]   a kind
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:14.920]   of way
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.580]   of speaking
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.020]   in the
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.320]   United
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:16.880]   States

[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:34.740]   especially
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.420]   the side

[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:38.660]   won
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.480]   and show
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:39.820]   the rest
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.060]   of the
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:40.360]   world
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.020]   that they're
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:41.560]   the winner
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.500]   well that's
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.000]   diplomacy
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.380]   we have
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:44.840]   an absence
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.620]   of diplomacy
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.300]   but you're
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:46.540]   absolutely
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:46.840]   right
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.480]   there needs
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:47.720]   to be
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.120]   respect
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.720]   the Chinese
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.200]   at least
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:50.960]   really care
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.400]   about
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:51.960]   respect
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.200]   and I
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:54.640]   wish there
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.020]   was just
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:55.360]   a bit
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:55.640]   more
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.060]   cultural
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:56.700]   fluency
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.700]   and I
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:58.000]   think a
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.280]   lot of
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:58.700]   things would
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.020]   be so
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:13:59.180]   much
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:13:59.580]   easier
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.660]   between
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:00.980]   the two
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:01.480]   countries
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:01.920]   just
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.440]   understanding
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:02.800]   that
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.540]   because
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:03.880]   you can
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.220]   actually
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:04.520]   push
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:04.760]   China
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.060]   to do
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:05.300]   a lot
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:05.420]   of
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:05.760]   things
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.120]   right
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:06.300]   all
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:06.540]   within
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:06.900]   reason
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.640]   that
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:07.940]   would
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.480]   work
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:08.640]   in
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:08.900]   favor
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.080]   of
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:09.200]   the
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:09.580]   U.S.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.880]   but understand
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.400]   that respect
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.060]   is vitally
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:12.660]   important
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.340]   face
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:13.920]   saving
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.840]   is very
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.100]   very
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:15.340]   very
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:15.820]   important

[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.080]   to what
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:17.080]   to what
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:17.520]   degree
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.280]   what
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:18.740]   Xi Jinping
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:19.280]   says
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:19.700]   and what
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.200]   they're
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:20.940]   putting out
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.220]   there in
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:21.720]   the world
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.900]   represents
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.580]   the truth
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.500]   so he has
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:24.940]   a whole way
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:25.360]   of being

[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:30.920]   together
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.540]   let's
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.220]   almost like
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:32.680]   let's be

[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:34.860]   bit has a
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:35.400]   similar way
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:35.900]   of being
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:36.780]   like let's
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:37.020]   just
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.000]   and the
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.360]   implied
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:38.920]   thing is
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.300]   like
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.800]   forgive the
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.140]   French
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:41.880]   but if
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.320]   you fuck
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:42.840]   with us
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.000]   we won't
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.440]   be nice
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:44.800]   but let's
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.160]   just all
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:45.620]   be nice
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:46.300]   together

[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.120]   the truth
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.520]   Xi Jinping
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:48.980]   is not
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.340]   Putin
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:49.980]   right
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.260]   and
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.920]   there is
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.720]   a genuine

[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:55.680]   on China's
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.060]   part
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.080]   to de-escalate
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:57.880]   again
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.380]   coming back
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:58.680]   to the
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:58.940]   level
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.580]   of
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.340]   pragmatism
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.060]   under
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:02.580]   economic
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.100]   strain
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:03.620]   in China
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.240]   you don't
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:04.640]   really want
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:04.840]   to be
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.080]   picking
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:05.560]   fights
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.940]   they
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.740]   don't
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.040]   agree
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:09.480]   at all
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:09.740]   with
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.440]   Trump's

[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.020]   views
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:14.060]   and world
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:14.520]   vision
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:14.940]   let's
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.360]   just put
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:15.560]   it
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.260]   simply
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.360]   so
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.860]   understanding
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.080]   that a lot
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:21.360]   of this
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:21.700]   is also
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:22.160]   driven by
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:22.720]   American
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.280]   internal
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:23.960]   politics

[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:24.960]   are aware
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.380]   of
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:25.980]   helps
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:26.460]   a bit
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.960]   but there's
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:28.580]   a genuine
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.580]   desire to
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:29.920]   take the
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.200]   temperature
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:30.520]   down
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:30.920]   with the
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.160]   U.S.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:31.800]   even if
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.220]   the weather
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:32.600]   doesn't
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:32.980]   fundamentally
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:33.460]   change
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.500]   what is
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.160]   a good
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:35.720]   diplomacy
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.520]   look like
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:36.820]   here
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.980]   for both
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.740]   sides
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:39.520]   what is
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:39.840]   the best
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.340]   possible
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.300]   and
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:41.680]   just
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.200]   strictly
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:42.360]   on
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:42.460]   the
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:42.860]   economics
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.120]   and
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:43.280]   the
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.340]   trade
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:44.720]   the
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.160]   tariffs
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.140]   what's
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:46.500]   the best
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:46.900]   possible
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.320]   outcome
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.100]   for the
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:48.320]   world
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.260]   I think
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:49.580]   that
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:49.940]   Trump
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.200]   can
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:50.540]   show
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:50.880]   to the
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.240]   American
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.860]   consumers
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.460]   that he
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:52.820]   has gotten
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.340]   some sort
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:53.580]   of a
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:53.840]   deal
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.520]   right
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:54.860]   that the
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.160]   Chinese
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:55.780]   have bought
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.200]   more
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:56.640]   American
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.000]   goods
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:57.520]   or promised
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:57.920]   to buy
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.300]   American
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:58.820]   goods
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.280]   and then
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:15:59.460]   the
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:15:59.920]   American
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.420]   companies
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:00.860]   can come
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.060]   into
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:01.440]   China
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.100]   and then
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:02.860]   a lot
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:03.180]   of the
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:03.580]   previously
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.200]   restricted
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:04.780]   investment
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.340]   opportunities
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:05.720]   are now
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:05.980]   not
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.400]   restricted
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:06.660]   and the
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:06.900]   American
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.320]   banks
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:07.700]   can make
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.660]   money
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.240]   in China
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.840]   he can
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.440]   say that
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.480]   and
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.860]   I think
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.020]   that could
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:15.620]   be part
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.040]   of a really
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:16.560]   realistic
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.080]   deal
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.640]   that somehow
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.100]   American
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:19.740]   companies will
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.040]   be better
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:20.440]   protected
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.000]   through
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:21.800]   IP protection
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.340]   and again
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:22.980]   that's in
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:23.340]   China's
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:23.800]   interest
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.180]   as well
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:24.380]   so I
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:24.680]   don't see
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.080]   a fundamental
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:25.580]   conflict
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:25.900]   here
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.840]   and at
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.120]   the same
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:28.400]   time
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:28.780]   they lower
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.300]   the tariffs
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:29.540]   right
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:29.920]   not to
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.320]   the rates
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:30.740]   where they
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.340]   were before
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.600]   but lower
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.660]   and you
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:33.880]   don't
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.280]   prohibit
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:34.740]   trade
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.360]   and then
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.020]   for China
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:37.420]   that would
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:37.800]   also be
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.060]   a success
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:38.380]   so you
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:38.800]   can actually
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.300]   have success
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:39.840]   for both
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.540]   places
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.300]   but being
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:41.640]   realistic
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.380]   is part
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:42.560]   of the
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:42.760]   game
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.060]   is tariffs
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.500]   question to
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:45.820]   you as an
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.160]   economist
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:46.660]   is tariffs
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.300]   a useful
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.880]   effective
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.860]   tool
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.080]   for
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.400]   global
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.560]   trade
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.900]   no
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.260]   I think
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.100]   that there
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:58.580]   is
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.680]   a real
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.060]   problem
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:00.760]   in global
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.040]   trading
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:01.540]   system
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.800]   and
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.600]   globalization
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.280]   in general
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:04.960]   that is not
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.320]   going to be
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:05.900]   resolved by
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.280]   tariffs
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.660]   we do need
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.020]   to think
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:08.500]   about
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.720]   more harmony
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.120]   between
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:13.780]   countries
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.620]   where
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.300]   let's say
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.040]   not one
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:17.320]   country
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:17.800]   dominates
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.140]   and here
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:19.240]   I'd push
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:19.920]   back on
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.160]   China
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:20.700]   and say
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.640]   yes you
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.340]   have amazing
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:22.740]   companies
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:23.240]   and competitive
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:23.740]   companies
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.740]   but you
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.160]   just can't
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:25.500]   dominate
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.000]   everything
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.840]   that would
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.180]   not be
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:27.520]   good for
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:27.880]   global
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.400]   harmony
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:28.880]   you need
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.180]   to give
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:29.400]   other
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:29.780]   countries
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.440]   opportunity
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.280]   you need
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:32.660]   to develop
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:32.980]   your own
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.300]   internal
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:33.860]   economy
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:34.800]   rely on
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.440]   your consumers
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:35.920]   as part
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.140]   of the
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:36.420]   deal
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.960]   tariffs
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.880]   this kind
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.260]   of highly
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.400]   protectionist
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.060]   method
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:41.840]   is very
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.620]   distortionary
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:42.960]   and it's
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.300]   going to be
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:43.700]   bad for
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.260]   the US
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:44.820]   I'd
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:45.420]   actually argue
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.120]   that both
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:46.580]   China
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:47.160]   and the
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:47.640]   US
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.600]   have
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.960]   totally
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.120]   taken
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:51.480]   advantage
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:51.860]   and also
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.480]   enjoyed
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.460]   the
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:55.200]   global
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.000]   economic
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:57.720]   realm
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.240]   under
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:58.760]   the US
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.040]   liberal
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:17:59.360]   order
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.960]   I think
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:01.320]   China
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:01.600]   quite
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:01.940]   likes
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.100]   it
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:02.500]   actually
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.440]   you know
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.160]   US
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:04.540]   kept
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.140]   peace
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:05.320]   and
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:05.560]   during
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:05.740]   this
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:06.040]   peaceful
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:06.540]   times
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:06.940]   things
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.160]   were
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:07.460]   working
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:07.900]   very well
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:08.600]   economically
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.960]   technologically
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.520]   they kept
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.160]   the sea lanes
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:12.700]   open
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.400]   they did
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:13.840]   their part
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.020]   to preserve
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.460]   peace
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.020]   to the extent
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:17.800]   they can
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.440]   I guess
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   but China
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.000]   wants peace
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:20.920]   only with peace
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.380]   can they do
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.200]   what they can
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:22.720]   and actually
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.240]   US
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.620]   despite saying
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:25.020]   they've been
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:25.680]   victimized
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:25.860]   not
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.160]   look
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:26.500]   they've
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:26.660]   had
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.140]   a very
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:27.340]   very
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:27.540]   good
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:27.860]   time
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:28.500]   right
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:28.820]   never
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.060]   have
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:29.760]   quality
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.220]   of life
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:30.560]   standards
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.080]   of living
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:31.860]   technology
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:32.780]   risen as
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:33.140]   much
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:33.560]   as
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.240]   the US
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:34.700]   did under
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:35.180]   its own
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:35.760]   liberal order
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.420]   than it has
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.440]   ever before
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.620]   and the amount
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.220]   of influence
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:39.580]   and power
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.180]   yes of course
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:41.660]   you can blame
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.000]   the US
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.500]   for lots
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:42.860]   of things
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:43.380]   that happened
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.400]   but it
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:44.800]   actually
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.780]   had a really
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.260]   good time
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:46.900]   and China
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:47.460]   as well
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.080]   so now
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.340]   they're going
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:48.580]   to take
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.060]   this apart
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.240]   they think
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:50.540]   that they're
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:51.020]   going to be
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:51.320]   somehow
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.220]   better off
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:52.520]   that
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.340]   American
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:53.900]   people
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.340]   and Chinese
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:54.620]   people
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:54.900]   are going
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.080]   to be
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:55.700]   better off
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.200]   under more
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:56.820]   disorderly
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.500]   fragmented
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.860]   rule of a jungle
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:18:59.680]   kind of world
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.920]   that's an illusion
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.400]   that's what
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.340]   politicians tell
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.120]   their people
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.460]   but that's
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:04.960]   not the truth
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.520]   so what
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:06.840]   are
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.420]   if not
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:07.880]   tariffs
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.840]   ways to
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.000]   incentivize
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.400]   countries like
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.000]   the United States
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:12.720]   to build
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.380]   internally
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:14.500]   so to build
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.860]   semiconductor ships
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.280]   internally
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:16.900]   for example
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.040]   well exactly
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.400]   tariffs is a way
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:19.980]   to punish
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.420]   foreigners
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.100]   but what
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:21.580]   you really
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.140]   want to do
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:22.920]   is to strengthen
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.520]   your own
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.760]   domestic competitiveness
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.480]   and I want
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:25.840]   to draw
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.220]   an analogy
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.140]   to the US
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:28.780]   Japan
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.000]   competition
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.300]   in the 1980s
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.440]   Japan actually
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.000]   took over
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.540]   in many parts
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:34.780]   of the
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:35.420]   semiconductors
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:35.920]   industry
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.340]   even though
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:36.880]   the microchip
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.340]   was invented
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:37.980]   in the US
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.800]   but guess
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.400]   what happened
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:39.880]   well
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.720]   it actually
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.700]   drove
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.760]   more competition
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.340]   and more
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.080]   mobilization
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:44.840]   in the US
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.360]   actually
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.400]   creating this
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.560]   innovation system
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.260]   changed a few
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:48.880]   really critical
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.500]   laws
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.320]   that helped
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:50.860]   with US
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:51.360]   innovation
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.480]   and the
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:52.840]   consumers
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:53.360]   benefited
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.120]   the US
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:54.620]   took over
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:54.980]   again
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:55.800]   as the leader
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:56.080]   of the
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:56.740]   semiconductors
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.260]   industry
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.140]   there's no
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:58.980]   better way
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.500]   than to
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:19:59.780]   strengthen
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:00.340]   yourself
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.040]   to be
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:01.460]   competitive
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.500]   because
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.060]   ultimately
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.460]   tariffs
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.400]   have not
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:05.960]   done anything
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.380]   to help
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.020]   the US
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.180]   the trade
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:08.540]   deficits
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:08.860]   have
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:10.220]   widened
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.140]   since
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:11.900]   Trump
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.560]   right
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.020]   they haven't
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:13.400]   closed
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.160]   the
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.540]   imbalance
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:14.900]   with
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.420]   China
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:15.640]   with
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:15.740]   the
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:15.920]   rest
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.060]   of
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:16.180]   the
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:16.520]   world
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.700]   because
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:18.360]   ultimately
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.140]   the US
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.580]   saves
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.340]   less than
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:21.940]   in a mess
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.000]   and that's
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:23.340]   a macro
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:23.840]   phenomenon
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.200]   it's not
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:24.560]   a trade
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.020]   phenomenon
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.040]   but I
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.100]   fear that
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:27.840]   the US
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.460]   by kind
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:28.920]   of dropping
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.480]   off of
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:29.680]   this
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.480]   global
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.360]   trading
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.340]   network
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.340]   and system
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.240]   it will
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:35.840]   lose
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.540]   more and
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:36.880]   more of
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.440]   its power
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.380]   you have
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:38.840]   power
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.400]   when you're
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:39.700]   deeply
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.500]   engaged
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.160]   and embedded
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:41.580]   with a
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:41.880]   country
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.240]   once
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:42.700]   you've
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.000]   left
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:44.320]   it
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:44.640]   you
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:44.980]   actually
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:45.400]   lose
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:45.620]   any
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:45.840]   sort
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:45.940]   of
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:46.320]   leverage
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.240]   so
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:47.700]   there's
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:47.940]   got to
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:48.040]   be

[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.180]   don't
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:13.380]   have
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:13.480]   the

[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:13.980]   of

[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:14.580]   institutions
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:14.900]   the
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:15.380]   culture
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.400]   to be
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:16.620]   able

[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:17.200]   tolerate
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:17.780]   and
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.180]   still
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.320]   maintain

[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:22.480]   together
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:22.940]   so I
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:23.140]   think
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:23.280]   it
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:23.480]   is

[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.720]   but
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.020]   yeah
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:27.320]   it's
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:27.420]   a
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:27.640]   puzzle
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.340]   so we
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:29.520]   talked
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:29.720]   about

[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:32.500]   you
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:32.760]   mentioned

[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:35.300]   the
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:35.500]   three

[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:37.420]   can
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:37.780]   we

[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:57.160]   I
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:57.540]   think
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.380]   ask
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:58.760]   the

[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:02.760]   see
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.360]   unification
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.600]   it's
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:04.880]   part
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.080]   of

[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:08.340]   if you
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:08.620]   will
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.620]   so
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.700]   and
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:11.980]   it's
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:12.200]   it's
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:12.560]   a chip
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:12.980]   right

[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:17.660]   but
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:18.000]   I'd
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:18.160]   say

[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.880]   because

[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:34.860]   it
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.040]   seems
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:35.200]   like

[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:39.220]   puzzle
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:40.020]   for how

[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:46.880]   think
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.160]   if we

[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:52.620]   good
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.040]   because
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:53.260]   it's
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:53.520]   probably
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:53.740]   good
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:53.920]   for

[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:14.920]   very very
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.320]   expensive

[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:27.320]   so much
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:27.700]   competition
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:28.160]   because
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:28.860]   there's
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:29.140]   a one

[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.060]   and you
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:36.940]   put everything
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:37.500]   into that
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.040]   one child
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.560]   that makes
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:39.960]   the child
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:40.620]   more anxious
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.500]   makes the
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:41.900]   whole
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.520]   environment
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:42.960]   more
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.420]   competitive
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.840]   and in
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.360]   the end
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:45.840]   these
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.280]   one child
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:46.680]   policy
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:47.480]   children
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.140]   don't want
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:48.340]   to have
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:48.520]   a lot
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:48.880]   of kids
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.220]   because
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:49.440]   they don't
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:49.580]   want
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:50.480]   them to
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:50.920]   see them
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.320]   suffer
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:51.760]   what they
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:51.920]   have
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.300]   suffered
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:52.680]   right
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.420]   so there
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:53.640]   are all
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:53.840]   these
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.660]   kind of
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:55.540]   unexpected
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:56.120]   consequences
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:56.700]   but also
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.060]   changing
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:57.480]   the social
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:57.880]   fabric
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.400]   I'd like
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:58.740]   to say
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:35:59.140]   that it
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:35:59.500]   broke the
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:35:59.940]   hierarchy
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.640]   of the
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:00.940]   family
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.260]   where the
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:01.560]   parents
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:01.820]   had the
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:02.100]   dominant
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:02.460]   role
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.300]   now the
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:03.520]   kids
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:03.780]   are the
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.120]   boss
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.420]   they boss
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:05.700]   everybody
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.000]   around
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:06.340]   they boss
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:06.520]   their
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:06.900]   grandparents
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:07.420]   around
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:09.480]   it relates
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:09.780]   to the
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.100]   puzzle
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:10.840]   the housing
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.280]   puzzle
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.420]   how is it
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:14.280]   possible that
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:14.760]   the Chinese
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.220]   youth can
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:15.780]   afford
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:16.740]   these
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:17.660]   really
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.200]   expensive
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.180]   real estate
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:19.700]   with their
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.080]   meager
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:20.660]   income
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.740]   well one
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.260]   common saying
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:22.580]   is that they
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:22.940]   have six
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:23.380]   wallets
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:23.960]   right
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.640]   you and
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.120]   your spouse
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.120]   together
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:26.400]   with the
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:26.760]   parents
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.640]   and maybe
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:27.900]   even the
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:28.240]   grandparents
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:28.660]   would chip
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:28.900]   in
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:29.900]   so there's
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.300]   this kind
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:31.080]   of
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.720]   intergenerational
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.320]   family dynamics
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.080]   that makes
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:36.840]   our models
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.600]   focused on the
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.040]   individual
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:38.700]   consumption
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:39.800]   just
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.620]   completely
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.980]   inappropriate
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.920]   to describe
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.720]   these dynamics
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.840]   but the
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.340]   demographic
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:48.420]   side is
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.000]   the other
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.320]   challenge
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.420]   which is
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.800]   they
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.860]   were so
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:56.220]   strict
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.080]   about the
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:57.780]   one-child policy
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:58.340]   and they
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:58.840]   kept it
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.980]   in for too
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.500]   long
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.580]   so that
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.460]   once they
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:03.420]   decide to
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.320]   loosen it
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.140]   and decided
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:05.760]   that
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.320]   fertility rates
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:07.760]   were way
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.300]   too low
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:08.840]   to sustain
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:09.240]   the Chinese
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:09.620]   economy
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:10.000]   in its
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:10.360]   future
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:10.680]   it was
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.180]   already
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.320]   too late
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.620]   and now
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.960]   they're finding
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.460]   all kinds
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:15.780]   of creative
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:16.240]   ways to
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:16.720]   make people
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.060]   have more
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:17.280]   kids
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:17.980]   this is not
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.440]   something
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.460]   that they
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.820]   can demand
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.480]   and command
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.220]   in ways
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:22.480]   that they
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:22.920]   can demand
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:23.420]   and command
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.620]   emerging
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:25.100]   strategic
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:25.680]   sectors
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.100]   right
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.500]   so
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.740]   all these
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:28.980]   really
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.440]   interesting
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:29.860]   social
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:30.540]   anecdotes
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:30.720]   where
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:30.860]   they're

[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.340]   we

[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:53.900]   even
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:54.160]   figured
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:54.380]   out
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:54.580]   the

[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:57.440]   productivity
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.360]   you know
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:58.600]   what are
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.160]   the factors

[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:00.400]   that will
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.000]   be most
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:01.360]   important
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.040]   for future

[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.100]   and so
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:05.580]   we shouldn't
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:05.920]   be
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:06.480]   terrified
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.160]   that there's

[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.340]   problem
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:08.680]   because I
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:08.940]   think the
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.300]   more
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:09.740]   important
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.200]   question
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.220]   is that
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:11.720]   skill
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:12.920]   gap
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.700]   right
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:14.180]   what kind
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:14.720]   of skills
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.140]   do we
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:15.520]   actually
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:15.920]   need
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:16.480]   in the
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:16.700]   economy
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:16.960]   what kind
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:17.440]   of education
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:17.800]   system
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.120]   should we
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:18.720]   design
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.180]   in the
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:19.540]   economy
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.640]   to better
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.160]   suit
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.040]   the country
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.160]   to an
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.040]   ever-evolving
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:24.860]   and transformative
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:26.200]   technological
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:26.920]   society
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.800]   because if that's
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:28.140]   successful
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:28.540]   then we'd
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:28.800]   be able
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.320]   to respond
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.040]   to whatever

[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.220]   the demographic
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:32.740]   situation
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.180]   creates
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:33.420]   yeah
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:34.140]   if you
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:34.760]   look at
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.720]   the most
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:35.980]   recent

[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.280]   on this
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:37.720]   issue
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.260]   they found
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:38.480]   that
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:38.920]   post

[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:42.800]   economies
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.320]   became
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:43.660]   richer
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.300]   not the
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:45.520]   other way
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:45.820]   around
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.680]   which was
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.060]   true for
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:47.420]   the pre

[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.480]   sample
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.260]   and the
[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:49.580]   reason
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:50.200]   is that
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:50.400]   these
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:50.620]   aging
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.140]   societies
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:51.680]   much
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:51.880]   more
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.260]   rapidly
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:53.200]   adopted

[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.180]   technologies
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:56.060]   automation
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.000]   that actually
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:57.200]   helped
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:57.720]   the entire

[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.060]   so
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:00.560]   should we
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.140]   be panicking
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:01.580]   about this
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:01.980]   now when
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:02.420]   we're actually
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.160]   also panicking
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:03.520]   about the
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:03.800]   fact there
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.000]   are not

[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:09.860]   more relevant
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:10.180]   for the

[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:14.640]   collapsing
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:15.440]   you have

[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:24.320]   going to

[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:32.820]   is such

[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:36.420]   been using

[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:37.640]   repeatedly

[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:39.440]   correctly
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:39.760]   maybe
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.460]   four to

[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:41.440]   maybe even
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.060]   six times
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:42.480]   since

[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:44.700]   during the

[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:45.620]   China's

[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.660]   I
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.560]   tend to
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:49.820]   not
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:50.240]   think
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:50.440]   that
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:50.780]   Chinese
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:51.400]   economy
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:51.700]   will
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.280]   collapse
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:52.740]   but
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.180]   with a
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:53.680]   slow down
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.180]   continue
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:54.840]   will it
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:55.180]   be able
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:56.300]   to lift

[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:57.660]   will it
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.320]   be able
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.020]   to come

[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.080]   cycle
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.680]   soon
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.100]   I think
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:03.440]   that's
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:03.660]   more
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:04.080]   relevant
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.260]   and

[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:08.800]   has a

[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:09.340]   potential
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:09.580]   because
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:09.760]   the
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.120]   fundamentals

[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:10.500]   still
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:10.700]   there
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:11.560]   right
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:11.800]   when
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:11.860]   we
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.000]   talk
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:12.160]   about
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:12.260]   the

[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:13.540]   the
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:13.860]   skills
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:14.040]   it's
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:14.120]   the
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:14.340]   human
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:14.760]   capital
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:15.120]   it's

[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:17.700]   it's
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.680]   the macroeconomic

[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:19.600]   and political
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.100]   stability
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:21.400]   that's a lot
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.760]   going for
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.320]   a country
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:23.860]   if you look
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:24.300]   around the
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:24.520]   world
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.180]   right now
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:25.740]   right
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:26.700]   and this
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:27.260]   is why
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:27.700]   the

[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:28.800]   is still
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:28.980]   there
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:29.360]   because the

[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.240]   are there
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:30.880]   even though

[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:32.760]   years
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:33.160]   ago
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.180]   there was
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:35.840]   a crackdown
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:36.120]   on the
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:36.620]   real estate
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:37.180]   sector
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.360]   and
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.140]   again
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:39.520]   it comes
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.120]   back to
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:40.500]   the
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.280]   lot of
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:41.400]   the
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:41.640]   social
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:41.940]   issues
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:42.280]   we were
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:42.700]   discussing
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:43.220]   you know
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:43.540]   why
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:43.920]   aren't
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.280]   people
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:44.680]   having
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.100]   kids
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:45.320]   well
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:45.620]   maybe
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:45.940]   it's
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:46.340]   because
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:46.780]   housing
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.040]   is
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:47.280]   too
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:47.840]   expensive
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.760]   maybe
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:48.940]   it's
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:49.140]   because
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:49.640]   education
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.060]   system
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:50.240]   is
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:50.420]   too
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:50.900]   competitive
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.660]   the
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:53.560]   speculative
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.160]   bubbles
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:54.800]   in the
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.180]   real estate
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:55.720]   is making
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:56.300]   housing
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:56.980]   unaffordable
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:57.400]   and that's
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:57.720]   not part
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.000]   of the
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:58.240]   Chinese
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:58.580]   social
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:59.220]   characteristics
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:42:59.820]   right
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:02.340]   and so
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:02.900]   when
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:03.640]   they decided
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.300]   that
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:04.940]   the
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:05.400]   property
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.280]   investors
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:06.680]   were going
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:06.900]   to be
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.240]   reigned
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:07.560]   in
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:07.760]   that
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.120]   housing
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:08.600]   was to
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:08.760]   be
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:09.020]   lived
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:09.200]   in
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:09.540]   not
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.940]   speculated
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:11.900]   it really
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.580]   brought down
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:13.120]   the whole
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.460]   sector
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:13.960]   in terms
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.140]   of
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:14.620]   investment
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:15.820]   in terms
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:16.240]   of
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:16.540]   the
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.040]   financing
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.180]   of the
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:18.540]   sector
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.500]   but
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:20.300]   ultimately
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:21.160]   it
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:21.380]   made
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:21.700]   such
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:21.860]   a
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:22.180]   massive
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:22.820]   impact
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.080]   or
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:23.500]   such
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:23.620]   a
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:23.840]   massive
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.200]   dent
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:24.400]   on
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:24.520]   the
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:24.920]   economy
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.500]   because
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.800]   it
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.180]   really
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:28.660]   embodied
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.680]   the two
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.320]   fundamental
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:30.800]   pillars
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:31.120]   of the
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:31.420]   economy
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:32.120]   one is
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.520]   the fiscal
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:33.920]   system
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.940]   and one is
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:35.280]   the financial
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:35.660]   system
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.100]   so coming
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:36.520]   back to our
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.040]   local mayor
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:37.580]   economy
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:39.180]   where did you
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:39.540]   think the
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.200]   local mayors
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:40.600]   got their
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:40.900]   funds
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:41.620]   right
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:42.000]   through real
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:42.280]   estate
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.300]   they sold
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:43.660]   land
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.960]   real estate
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:46.800]   property developers
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.380]   came in
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:47.640]   they can
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:47.920]   develop
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.460]   the entire
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:49.340]   local
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:49.780]   economy
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.460]   because
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:51.200]   the services
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:51.600]   will come
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:51.700]   in
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:52.040]   the jobs
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.360]   will come
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:52.600]   in
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:53.060]   and by
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:53.300]   the way
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:53.600]   you're an

[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:56.240]   city
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:56.880]   so you
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:57.400]   want these
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:57.740]   property
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.360]   developers
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:58.860]   around
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:04.900]   many countries
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:05.740]   throughout history
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.900]   all have this
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:07.420]   property
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:08.300]   transition
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:09.100]   right
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:09.700]   you need to
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:10.460]   wean the
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:10.900]   economy
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.600]   off of
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.040]   property
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.060]   in a
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:14.660]   good
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:16.000]   situation
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:16.680]   it takes
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:16.980]   three to
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:17.420]   five years
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:17.860]   in a bad
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:18.320]   situation
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:18.900]   it can
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:19.060]   take
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:19.500]   ten years
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.140]   I don't
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:21.400]   know
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.140]   where
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:22.700]   China
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.840]   belongs
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.380]   currently
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.520]   but
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.120]   the
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:27.660]   real estate
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.480]   collapse
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:29.000]   also meant
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:29.580]   the local
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:30.300]   finances
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:30.580]   local

[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.420]   finances
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:31.960]   also
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.300]   shrunk
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:32.920]   dramatically
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.320]   real estate
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.200]   was a really
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:35.840]   important part
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.140]   of the
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:36.460]   financial
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:36.880]   industry
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:37.220]   it brought
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:37.820]   that down
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:38.720]   together
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.320]   it really
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:40.920]   had a major
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.360]   impact on
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:41.720]   the economy
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.320]   but also
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:42.640]   from the
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:43.060]   consumer
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:43.580]   side
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.260]   their
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:44.700]   wealth
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:44.940]   was
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:45.420]   primarily
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.320]   tied
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:46.680]   into
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:46.880]   real
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:47.140]   estate
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:47.680]   not the

[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:48.320]   market
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.180]   not other
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:49.440]   kind of
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:49.760]   investment
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.340]   opportunities
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.020]   it was
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:51.720]   real estate
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.060]   so they
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:52.600]   felt poor
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.280]   they consumed
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:53.620]   less
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.160]   so in the
