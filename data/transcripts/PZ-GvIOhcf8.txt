[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.620]   An ability to control your levels of stress in real time
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.700]   is extremely powerful.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.140]   It turns out you can do this
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.140]   using physiology and neuroscience.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.100]   Your breathing can directly impact your heart rate
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.500]   and your level of stress or calm.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.100]   Here's how it works.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.140]   When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down.
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.780]   This creates more space in your thoracic cavity
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.660]   and your heart actually gets a little bit bigger.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.700]   As a consequence, the rate of blood flow
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.500]   through that larger heart volume slows down.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.140]   A signal is sent from a group of neurons on your heart
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.180]   called the sinoatrial node.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.980]   That signal goes up to the brain
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.300]   and your brain sends a signal to speed the heart up.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.500]   In other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260]   The opposite is true as well.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.460]   When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.020]   Your heart gets a little bit smaller
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.660]   because there's a little bit less space
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.340]   in your thoracic cavity.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.800]   As a consequence, blood flows more quickly
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.420]   through that smaller volume.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.700]   The sinoatrial node registers that
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.920]   and sends a signal to your brain
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.380]   and the brain sends a signal to slow the heart down.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.460]   So in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up,
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.780]   exhaling slows your heart rate down.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.500]   So if you want to speed up your heart rate
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   and be more alert, inhale more
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.500]   or make those inhales more vigorous, more intense.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.480]   If you want to calm down, you can do that quickly
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.880]   by making your exhales slightly longer than your inhales
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.900]   or making them more vigorous.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.460]   This doesn't require any breath work.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.160]   This is something that you can do in real time.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.620]   And that's what's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.060]   That's the technical phrase.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.700]   It's also the basis of what's called
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.320]   heart rate variability or HRV.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.860]   But all you need to remember is inhaling deeper and longer
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.460]   will speed your heart rate up.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.920]   Exhaling longer and more intensely
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   will slow your heart rate down
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.780]   and will allow you to calm down in real time.
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.940]   (silence)
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.100]   (silence)
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:27.080]   [ Silence ]
