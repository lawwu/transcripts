[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020]   given to studies of mental health,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.940]   physical health, and human performance.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900]   If you'd like to subscribe

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.600]   is for you.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.780]   Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.200]   The first question asks,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.500]   is it possible to get a cold or to get sick
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.180]   from deliberate cold exposure?
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.820]   And I suppose a related question is,
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.380]   should you even do deliberate cold exposure
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.460]   if you have a sniffle, a cold, or a flu?
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.860]   I get that question all the time as well.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.740]   So I'll answer both of those questions.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.300]   And I will also touch on some of the immune enhancing effects
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.060]   of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.700]   But just to make sure that we answer the specific question
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.400]   asked here right off the bat,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.160]   is it possible to get a cold or to get sick
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.320]   from deliberate cold exposure?
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.700]   Well, assuming that you're not doing
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.460]   the deliberate cold exposure
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.780]   for more than say five or six minutes at one stretch,
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.000]   probably not directly from the deliberate cold exposure.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.780]   I mentioned that because most people are doing
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.060]   anywhere from about a minute to three minutes,
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.420]   sometimes five or six minutes,
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.580]   and maybe for those of you that are really pushing it,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.980]   10 minutes of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.820]   And most often after doing that deliberate cold exposure,
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.600]   people are either getting clothed
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.800]   or they're getting into a sauna
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.740]   or they're taking a hot shower and then getting clothed
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.180]   and heading off into their day or off to sleep,
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.540]   depending on what time of day or night
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.900]   you happen to do your deliberate cold exposure.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.580]   We can safely say that if you warm up
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.260]   after a relatively brief, meaning one minute to,
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.100]   let's extend it out to 10 minutes,
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.780]   10 minute deliberate cold exposure,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.100]   although I really want to caution people
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   to not do 10 minute deliberate cold exposure
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.020]   right off the bat.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.220]   If you are somebody who is not accustomed to it,
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.940]   don't jump right up to that long exposure to cold water,
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.120]   start with shorter exposures.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.900]   But if you're doing that one to 10 minute
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.220]   deliberate cold exposure,
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.820]   and then you're getting warm afterwards
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.140]   and heading about your day,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.060]   I can't see how the deliberate cold exposure itself
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.740]   would enhance your susceptibility to getting sick.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.280]   That said, we know from an enormous number of studies
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.540]   that have looked at cold virus transmission
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.060]   and other forms of viral and bacterial transmission,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.860]   that the environment that you happen to be in
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.980]   does impact your susceptibility to colds
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.460]   and other types of viruses and to bacterial infections
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.140]   in the following way.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.420]   There have been controlled studies in which people
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.380]   go into laboratories.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.260]   Those laboratories have rooms
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.420]   in which they can very tightly control the humidity,
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.660]   so essentially the water content in the air,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.240]   as well as the temperature in the room.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.200]   And if you look at the total mass of those data,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.660]   we can say a couple of specific things
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.140]   in kind of bullet point fashion.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.580]   First off, cold, dry air does seem to increase
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.020]   our susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.360]   because whether or not you're a mouth breather
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.260]   or a nose breather,
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620]   and by the way, I suggest everyone be a nose breather
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.500]   unless you're exercising hard enough
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.660]   that you have to breathe through your mouth
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020]   or you're talking or something of that sort.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.020]   But if you're a nose breather or a mouth breather or both,
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.100]   viruses and bacteria enter through your nose and mouth,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.280]   sometimes through your eyes,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.020]   but your nose and mouth are going to be
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.620]   the main sites of entry and your main barriers
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.180]   to viral and bacterial infections.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.120]   In fact, one of the ways you are constantly fighting off
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.580]   bacterial and viral infections
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.920]   that you're exposed to all the time
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.620]   is by way of those viruses and bacteria getting trapped
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.020]   in the mucus lining of your nose or your mouth,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.320]   most notably in the back of your throat.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.100]   So if you spend time in cold, dry environments,
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.100]   there is a tendency for that mucosal lining to be thinner.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.400]   There is a tendency for that mucosal lining
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.860]   to not be as robust in general.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.500]   When I say robust, what I mean is that
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.180]   if you're mouth breathing, for instance,
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.860]   in a cold, dry environment,
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.620]   I'm thinking from the time I spent
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.140]   in Cambridge, Massachusetts in winter at the tea station,
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.940]   you know, if you're, I'm just imagining myself
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.600]   'cause it was so darn cold back there,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.580]   you know, breathing through your mouth
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.200]   or having gone for a run and your mouth isn't covered,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.440]   or even if you're deliberately nasal breathing,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.260]   you are drying out your nasal passages
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.680]   and making them more susceptible to infections.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.160]   Does that necessarily mean that
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.120]   every time you go out in cold, dry air
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.500]   that you're going to get an infection?
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.980]   No, of course it doesn't.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.260]   But to relate this back to the question we had before,
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.020]   there are a lot of data pointing to the fact
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.000]   that more humid, warm environments
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.260]   are going to make your mucosal lining
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.300]   and the general upper respiratory area more,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.280]   I don't want to say immune
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.700]   'cause I don't want to conflate that word
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.940]   with the other meaning of immune,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.020]   it's going to make it more robust
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.860]   against bacterial and viral infections, okay?
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.820]   So if you get into a cold shower or a cold plunge
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.140]   or a cold ocean or a cold lake,
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.740]   and then you get out and you're out there,
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.820]   you know, shivering and shaking,
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.780]   trying to boost your metabolism,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.360]   whatever it is that you're doing it for,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.340]   and it's cold, dry air,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.740]   and especially if you're mouth breathing
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.220]   in that cold, dry air,
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.460]   yes, I could see how that might lead
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.420]   to a higher probability of getting a cold
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.840]   or other type of infection.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.420]   But there's nothing specific
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.500]   about the deliberate cold exposure itself
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.980]   that can induce a cold or other type of infection,
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.700]   assuming that the water is clean, right?
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.220]   We're not talking about bacterial infections
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.680]   of cuts on the skin, et cetera.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.020]   We're talking about colds and other forms of being sick,
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.660]   namely upper respiratory infections, okay?
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.900]   Now, with that said, I often get asked
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.180]   whether or not for people who already have a little sniffle,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.980]   they're feeling a little rundown,
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.140]   or perhaps a lot rundown,
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.660]   should they do deliberate cold exposure?
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.660]   It's a little tricky to give a one-size-fits-all answer,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.820]   but I think we can safely say
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.920]   that if you are feeling malaise,
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.540]   if you're feeling like you have to rest,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.900]   you're tired, you're not feeling good because of a cold
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.220]   or because of a flu or because of a bacterial infection,
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.760]   okay, now I'm not saying just feeling not good,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.040]   I'm saying feeling not good due to a cold
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.460]   or other form of virus or bacterial infection,
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.980]   then I would say stay out of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.380]   Don't use it.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.300]   Now, why would I say that?
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.240]   Given the data I'll talk about in a few minutes,
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.260]   showing that regular deliberate cold exposure,
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.580]   if done correctly, can in fact increase immune system markers
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.180]   and perhaps even to make you much more robust
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.980]   to combating different types of infection
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.440]   through the release of adrenaline.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.700]   We'll talk about what all that looks like in a moment
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.540]   in terms of protocols and some of the science,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.060]   but to just be very clear and very direct,
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.140]   if you're sick, stay out of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.280]   There, I would instead recommend warmer hot baths,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.300]   warmer hot showers, the sauna, et cetera,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.580]   but I also would caution that if you are getting
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.380]   into saunas that are too hot,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.180]   saunas that are so hot that it's stressful for you,
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.220]   and again, a lot of people use deliberate heat exposure
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.680]   because of the stress it induces.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.980]   They're doing some heat-induced,
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.880]   for instance, heat shock proteins
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.940]   and different ways of increasing heart rate.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.540]   That's a different sort of thing.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.140]   That's hard, stressful in order to generate an adaptation.
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.760]   I don't recommend doing that.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.460]   In fact, I don't recommend doing deliberate cold exposure,
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.020]   exercise or deliberate heat exposure
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.900]   if you're feeling really not well.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.920]   Now, if you're feeling just a little bit not well,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.260]   you're feeling a little bit rundown,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.500]   a little bit of sniffle, a little bit of malaise,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.180]   well, then it's kind of an edge case
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.040]   where we could say, all right, you know what?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.740]   Just take a hot shower and go to sleep.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.660]   That's probably the best advice, right?
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.540]   That good old-fashioned advice.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.340]   But if you are determined to do
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.020]   your deliberate cold exposure anyway,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.700]   then I would say definitely get warm
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.100]   or take a hot shower afterwards, hot bath or a hot sauna,
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.580]   but not too hot that it's stressful, of course.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.080]   And keep in mind that one of the variables
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.460]   that's been measured quite a lot in laboratory studies
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.940]   of deliberate cold exposure
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.980]   is the increase in immune system markers.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.140]   So I'll provide a few links to some of these studies,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.380]   although nowadays there are many, many of them,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.140]   but it's very clear that deliberate cold exposure
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.520]   can increase the release and the production
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.260]   of different immune molecules and immune cells.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.100]   One slightly older study, but nonetheless,
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.940]   a good study that has relevance here
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.120]   is entitled "Immune System of Cold Exposed
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.300]   and Cold Adapted Humans."
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.400]   Keep in mind that this study is a little bit extreme,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.140]   and there are reasons for that,
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.340]   I guess to make a long story short.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.740]   Oftentimes in order to "see an effect" in a study,
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.300]   scientists will use conditions that are pretty extreme
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.880]   compared to control group.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.620]   Oftentimes you'll see a dose response too,
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.160]   but it's a little bit trickier to do
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.600]   with human studies of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.020]   It can be done, but not too common.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.640]   But here they used a pretty,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.260]   what I would call extreme stimulus.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.000]   It was exposing people to 14 degrees Celsius water.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.120]   So that's 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn't that cold.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.880]   It's kind of like cool, I would say very cool water,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.860]   but not what you might consider cold,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.520]   depending on how well you tolerate cold,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.920]   and that will vary of course.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.740]   But they had people exposed to that for an hour,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.640]   which is a pretty long time.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.380]   Most people, as I mentioned, are using colder temperatures
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.420]   of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.280]   So even, you know, high 30s, low 40s,
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.300]   maybe upper 40s for anywhere from one to 10 minutes,
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.540]   depending on how conditioned they are.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.020]   And again, don't just jump into 10 minutes
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.180]   of deliberate cold exposure,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.700]   please at, you know, 35 degrees or 40 degrees
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.820]   or even 45 degrees.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.780]   If you aren't familiar with deliberate cold exposure,
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.140]   you have to ease into these sorts of things over time.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.640]   And if you're interested in protocols
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   for deliberate cold exposure,
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.580]   we have a zero cost newsletter at hubermanlab.com,
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.860]   go to the menu, go newsletter, and you can find that.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.340]   We've done several episodes on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.620]   In any event, this study,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.000]   Immune System of Cold Exposing Cold Adapted Humans,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.920]   as I mentioned, had people in 14 degrees Celsius water
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.140]   for one hour.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.960]   And basically what they found is that one exposure to cold
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.020]   did not change immune system function
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.900]   in any kind of significant way.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.220]   However, what they found was
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.760]   if people did deliberate cold exposure repeatedly
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.100]   over a period of about six weeks,
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.060]   and by repeatedly, I mean three times per week,
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.980]   what they found were trends.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.200]   And again, trends are not statistically significant,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.820]   but trends towards increases in plasma concentrations
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.200]   of things like IL-6, interleukin-6,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.180]   or total numbers of T lymphocytes and T helper cells
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.720]   and T suppressor cells and activated T and B lymphocytes.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.900]   These are all immune cells and immune molecules
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.620]   that roughly correspond to an increase
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.660]   in immune system function.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.240]   If you'd like to learn more about the immune system,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.160]   I did an episode on immune system function.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.020]   Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.900]   and it spells out the basic cell types
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.740]   of what's called the innate and the adaptive immune system.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.900]   This study, which we will link to in the show note captions,
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.980]   is but one study of several other studies showing
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.100]   that deliberate cold exposure
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.600]   can increase immune system markers,
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.660]   especially when deliberate cold exposure
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.460]   is done repeatedly over time.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.700]   So in this case, three times a week
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.100]   over a period of six weeks.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.240]   But again, I want to highlight,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.860]   these aren't highly significant effects.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.660]   These are trends in the direction
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.440]   of increased numbers of immune cells and immune markers.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.500]   Now, what's impossible to know
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.820]   is how those trends translate to actual resistance
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.940]   to specific concentrations of say cold virus or flu virus
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.720]   or any other virus or bacteria.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.560]   That would be great,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.540]   but that's a very difficult study to do,
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.580]   especially in the context
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.500]   of deliberate cold exposure as well.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.440]   Now, we can all be scientists about this and say,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.180]   what is it about deliberate cold exposure
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.140]   that would increase immune system function?
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.260]   And there, we can confidently say
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.740]   the molecules epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.780]   which are released in both brain and body
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.340]   in response to cold water exposure,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.060]   as well as things like deliberate hyperventilation.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.980]   The release of norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.900]   into the brain and body is known
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.840]   to have a number of different effects
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.220]   related to the immune system.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.980]   It can be pro-immune, at least in the short term,
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.580]   and in the long term,
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.120]   meaning if noradrenaline and adrenaline,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.420]   again, those are just different names
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.900]   for norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.040]   I'm sorry, those are the same thing,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.860]   but that's why I use them interchangeably
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.920]   so that you don't get confused.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.960]   If you see noradrenaline or norepinephrine,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.800]   that's the same thing.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.300]   You hear epinephrine or adrenaline, same thing.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.700]   Deliberate cold exposure or deliberate hyperventilation
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.540]   will increase those molecules,
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.420]   norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.500]   and their increase is pro-immune.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.100]   It can trigger the activation of immune cells
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.020]   and immune molecules that can make you more resistant
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.840]   to certain forms of infection.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.020]   However, if norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.080]   are elevated chronically,
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.160]   and especially if they are elevated late in the day,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.340]   repeatedly over many, many days,
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.360]   that can cause reductions in the number and efficiency
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.740]   of immune cells in combating infections.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.260]   So getting cold in this context of whether or not
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.560]   you can get sick from it should really be considered more
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.900]   as what happens when you spike your adrenaline
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.580]   and norepinephrine.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.820]   And there's one other study that we can look to,
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.900]   which is now really a famous study published
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.180]   in "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.540]   looking at so-called Wim Hof breathing,
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.980]   but really that just translates
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.700]   to cyclic hyperventilation.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.180]   So this is inhaling through the nose,
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.900]   exhaling through the mouth repeatedly 25 times or so.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.980]   [inhaling and exhaling]
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.220]   If you do that, you notice you feel quite warm.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.900]   Has to do with some things related to vasodilation,
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.420]   has some things to do with release
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.620]   of norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.780]   We know that pattern of deliberate hyperventilation,
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.000]   much like deliberate cold exposure,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.160]   deploys or releases noradrenaline and adrenaline
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.440]   into your brain and body.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.260]   And we know from this study entitled "Voluntary Activation
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.460]   "of the Sympathetic Nervous System
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.460]   "and Attenuation of the Nate Immune Response in Humans"
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.620]   showed really nicely, I think,
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.620]   that if people are injected with E. coli, right, a bacteria,
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.560]   it's actually, they did this through endotoxin injections,
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.940]   people got really sick.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.220]   They'd get, you know, feel like they had the flu,
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.140]   they vomit, diarrhea, get a fever, et cetera.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.120]   However, if they did the sorts of breathing
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.880]   that I talked about just a moment ago,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.260]   prior to that, they were able to ward off
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.240]   a lot of the symptoms associated
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.040]   with the endotoxin infection.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.160]   And you would say, okay, wow,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.640]   their immune system just fired up
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.940]   and they were able to fight it off.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.500]   But it's trickier than that, actually.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.980]   What happened was the release of epinephrine
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.680]   and norepinephrine from cyclic hyperventilation,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.800]   which is really what [inhaling and exhaling]
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.380]   really is cyclic hyperventilation,
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.500]   also called Wim Hof breathing,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.820]   also called Tummo breathing, et cetera,
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.340]   that actually had a suppressive action
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.560]   on certain arms of the immune system
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.080]   in a way that allowed people to avoid symptomology,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.140]   such as fever, nausea, et cetera.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.080]   And we would imagine the same thing would occur
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.180]   with deliberate cold exposure
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.620]   done prior to bacterial infection or viral exposure.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.580]   So if you're sensing that I'm saying two things at once,
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.500]   I am.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.220]   I'm saying deliberate cold exposure
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.200]   and cyclic hyperventilation can both cause deployment
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.420]   of molecules such as epinephrine and norepinephrine
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.220]   that lead to enhanced immune system function
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.420]   if done repeatedly.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.020]   I'm also saying that increasing norepinephrine
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.640]   and epinephrine too much can suppress your immune system.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.420]   In this study, the PNAS study that I mentioned a moment ago,
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.020]   that suppression of the immune response
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.700]   was actually one of the reasons people avoided symptomology,
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.780]   but they were still injected with endotoxin,
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.100]   so they just weren't fighting off the endotoxin with fever.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.300]   Remember, fever is an adaptation to fight infection.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.120]   It's designed essentially to heat up the infection
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.140]   and kill it.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.660]   So what are we to take away from this?
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.500]   Here are what I think are the key takeaways.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.620]   One, if you are feeling good to great,
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.340]   do your deliberate cold exposure.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.860]   And perhaps don't worry so much
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.780]   about using your body's natural metabolism
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.580]   and thermogenic abilities to heat back up afterwards.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.540]   But I don't suggest anyone ever allow themselves
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.060]   to stay really cold after deliberate cold exposure
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.580]   for more than 10, 15 minutes or maybe half an hour, right?
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.500]   Get bundled back up or put on clothes.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.880]   If it's a nice hot sunny day,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.640]   get out in the sun and warm up.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.800]   Again, temperatures and conditions will vary
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.460]   for different people, different locations, et cetera.
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.460]   If you are not feeling great,
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.720]   you're feeling a little rundown
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.140]   and you really want to do your deliberate cold exposure,
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.700]   do it, but then warm up really well afterwards.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.260]   Maybe even drink some hot tea
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.040]   or other fluid afterwards as well.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.740]   And if you are not feeling good,
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.740]   you're feeling malaise, you're feeling rundown,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.580]   despite what you read about deliberate cold exposure
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.440]   or cyclic hyperventilation,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.200]   allowing for the deployment of immune molecules
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.460]   or increasing the number of immune cells that you're making,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.900]   avoid anything that's stressful or challenging,
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.740]   whether or not it's a cold challenge, a heat challenge,
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.960]   or an exercise challenge when you're feeling rundown,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.180]   because under those conditions,
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.940]   what you really want to do is slow your circulation down,
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.660]   probably find it take little walks or something,
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.200]   provided you're not doubled over in bed
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.980]   and vomiting and things like that.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.860]   A little bit of movement,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.700]   probably good to circulate your blood.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.460]   But in general, the advice that you get to rest
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.220]   when you're sick and not push yourself,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.420]   that's really good advice
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.920]   because you want all of your body's resources to be devoted
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.980]   to getting over that infection.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.160]   And if you're interested in sickness and sickness behavior
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.580]   and the sorts of behaviors that can combat infection,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.580]   check out the episode I did on the immune system.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.020]   We'll link to it in the show note captions
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.940]   because it talks about how when we have a viral
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.620]   or bacterial infection,
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.920]   a whole set of brain circuits get activated
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.160]   that kind of encourage us to be more in the fetal position,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.900]   to move less, to be eyes down, to kind of slump down.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.580]   That's not a coincidence.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.960]   That's because of the activation
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.660]   of these so-called sickness circuits
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.140]   that are really designed to help you heal yourself.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.960]   So I both apologize and what do the kids say?
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.080]   Sorry, not sorry.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.500]   Don't apologize for the somewhat nuanced answer here
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.340]   because a lot of information out there says,
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.660]   "Oh, you know, cold boosts your immune system."
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.540]   And yeah, that's true under certain conditions.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.960]   It can also deplete your immune system
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.320]   and limit your ability to fight off infections
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.900]   under other conditions.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.280]   And perhaps the last thing to say about this
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.940]   is that I am a big believer in using nasal breathing
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.480]   whenever you don't have to breathe through your mouth.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.640]   So if you're exercising hard,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.000]   by all means, breathe through your mouth.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.900]   If you're doing martial arts
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.940]   and it requires that you breathe through your mouth,
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.140]   go ahead and do that.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.160]   But if you're doing say zone two cardio, low level cardio,
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.180]   or you're just walking along,
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.780]   it's very clear based on a growing amount of data
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.760]   that being a nasal breather
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.220]   is better than being a mouth breather.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.820]   And there are a number of different reasons for that.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.080]   We've talked about on the podcast and elsewhere,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.760]   but one of the additional reasons is
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.780]   a main site of entry for infections is through the mouth.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.080]   So keep that mouth shut unless you need to talk.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.920]   Thank you for joining
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.580]   for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.960]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.560]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.820]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.060]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Channel
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.060]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.200]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.400]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.620]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel,
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.480]   it's really twofold.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.400]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.880]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.920]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.600]   every Monday in full length.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.000]   We are not going to change the format
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.580]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.020]   and to fund research,
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.080]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.120]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.920]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.120]   that we are most interested in.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.120]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.760]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.800]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.700]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.120]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.800]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.120]   and other media channels.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.680]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.900]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.080]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.800]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.820]   in the first place.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.160]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.120]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.900]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.400]   for research through the premium channel.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.000]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.960]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.040]   to further support research for science
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.840]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.360]   physical health, and performance.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.200]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.960]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.040]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.800]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.140]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.040]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.620]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.000]   that other people ask as well.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.940]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.740]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.640]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.880]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes and not found elsewhere.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.160]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.520]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.920]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.600]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.480]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.240]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.820]   [upbeat music]
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.400]   (upbeat music)
