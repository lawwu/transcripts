[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   When you find that inner verbal stream
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.840]   going in the negative direction,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.120]   so negative self-talk, so the chatter, right?
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.480]   You're an idiot, such an idiot,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.820]   or you're looping over a problem
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.420]   without making any progress.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.440]   Putting those words in, you know,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.200]   actually taking that inner stream
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.120]   and making a story out of it
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.920]   is essentially what the Penny Baker writing cues you to do,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.360]   because we are taught when we write,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.600]   we write in sentences.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.560]   There's a structure to our writing
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.920]   that we impose on our thinking.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.320]   Up here in our minds, it's a free-for-all.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.740]   It can go in all sorts of directions,
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.080]   and that chaos is in part what can make chatter so aversive.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.980]   - I'm so glad you're bringing this up.
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.480]   Our very first guest ever on this podcast
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.560]   was a guy named Carl Deisseroth.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.080]   Bioengineer, he's a practicing psychiatrist.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.600]   He's one of the luminaries of neuroscience.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.520]   He developed these light-sensitive channels
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.280]   to be able to manipulate neurons in animal models,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.160]   but also now in human clinical work as well.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   And one thing that he shared was that
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.880]   after he puts his kids to sleep,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   I think now they're grown,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.360]   but in the evening, he'll sit, deliberately sit still,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.000]   completely bodily still, close his eyes,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.380]   and force himself to think in complete sentences
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.900]   for maybe an hour or so, maybe more.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.740]   And I thought to myself,
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.440]   "Wow, that's a very disciplined practice."
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.640]   It also speaks to what you're saying,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.560]   which is that typically thinking in complete sentences
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.000]   is not the default of the mind.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.240]   So I don't know what his specific reason for doing that is.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.500]   He shared a few of them on that podcast episode,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.360]   but I'm sure there are others as well.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.520]   But I tried it.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.160]   It's very difficult, especially with eyes closed,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.920]   to not drift into multiple narratives,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.740]   that the stream sort of split into your tributaries,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.860]   and then it sort of, you dissolve into sleep or-
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.980]   - A meditation experience.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.260]   - Yeah, an almost dream-like state
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.060]   where you're in these liminal states.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.100]   - Well, that's, I think, where the writing provides
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.260]   a tool to structure your thinking.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.980]   Talking has a similar modality.
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860]   So when we talk to people,
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.860]   there is a structure to the way we converse,
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700]   where we're not, if I were to just talk to you
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.580]   the way I pinball in my mind,
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.940]   you wouldn't be able to understand me,
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.580]   and you would think I'm out of my bleeping mind, right?
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.980]   Because I would be unable
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.660]   to have a meaningful conversation with you.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.060]   So there's some research which shows that
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.980]   if you get people to think of,
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.100]   to recall a chatter-provoking experience,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.300]   so think about something negative that's happened to you,
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.080]   and then you randomly assign them to just think about it
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.140]   and work it through in their mind versus write about it,
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.780]   so i.e. a Pennebaker writing-like condition,
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.140]   or talk about it to someone else.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.140]   The talking and the writing both do better
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.740]   in terms of how they feel when they're done
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.640]   as compared to the just thinking,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.220]   because there's no guardrails to the way we think.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.720]   That we are taught, I should add,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.400]   because we're gonna give people guardrails
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.500]   later in this episode.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.900]   - So in addition to using the Pennebaker approach,
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.460]   and by the way, we'll provide a link
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.740]   to some resources for the Pennebaker journaling,
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.380]   'cause there's some free online resources
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.100]   that I think are really powerful for people to use
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.940]   if they wanna use that as a template,
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.220]   for cathartic reasons,
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.740]   or just get one's mind around a problem,
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.940]   or something I'm very familiar with,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.500]   waking up and just feeling like everything is kind of,
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.360]   not a storm in there, but a bit too disorganized
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.180]   to get my head right, you know?
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.860]   And so I'd need things to get my head right.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.300]   Sometimes it's music, sometimes it's writing.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.140]   It sounds like journaling
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.000]   is just a really useful practice overall.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.540]   - It's a useful practice,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.060]   and it's an underutilized practice.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.260]   So we did two pretty large studies during COVID
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.200]   to look at how people,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.060]   how are people regulating their emotions on a daily basis
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.180]   to deal with the anxiety surrounding COVID?
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.460]   And we gave them a series of tools that they could check off
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.980]   if they use the tools that day.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.980]   And we learned a couple of really interesting things.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.020]   Number one, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.860]   for folks.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.500]   So remarkable variability characterized the tools
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.980]   that work for person A versus person B.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.520]   Number two, it was seldom the case
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.140]   that people used one tool.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.740]   In general, people used on average
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.100]   three or four tools each day,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.600]   which I think is another really important take-home
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.360]   because I am often asked as, for example,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.100]   what is my favorite tool for managing emotions?
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.100]   I don't have a favorite tool
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.180]   because I'm typically using multiple tools,
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.900]   and most people are doing exactly the same.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.560]   So it's kind of like what we're learning
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.240]   about emotion regulation is,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.580]   in some ways it's similar to physical exercise.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.620]   You're not only going to work out your rear deltoids
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.940]   with the same exercise every day.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.340]   You would have like funky looking shoulders if you did,
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.620]   right, and you'd probably be pretty weak
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.300]   in lots of other parts of your body.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.580]   You're doing multiple things,
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.700]   and the multiple things that you do to exercise,
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.900]   I'm guessing, are different from the multiple things
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.820]   that I do to exercise, yet we may well be equally fit.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.680]   Well, you may be a little bit more fit than me,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.040]   but you get the drift.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.420]   So there's this beautiful variability
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.340]   to how we manage our inner worlds.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.020]   To bring it back to expressive writing,
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.580]   we found that expressive writing,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.360]   when people used it, was really, really useful.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.220]   It moved the needle on their COVID anxiety,
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.040]   but it was an underutilized tool.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.420]   People didn't do it very much,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.540]   and I think that's in part
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.240]   because it is somewhat effortful.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.960]   (upbeat music)
