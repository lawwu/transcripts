[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.860]   A pretty common question is reflected in today's email from a young woman from Sweden, a listener
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.560]   to the podcast. And Pastor John joins us over Skype today to answer.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.380]   "Dear Pastor John, hello to you and the team at DG. I'm a relatively new Christian in Sweden,
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.540]   and I have a problem with my church. I got baptized four years ago and became a member.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.420]   As time passed, I noticed our sermons don't touch on sin and never call for repentance.
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.180]   I've asked one of the pastors who said they are not preaching contradictory to the Bible,
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.420]   they just decided to not talk directly about sin. They want to focus on the love of Jesus
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.500]   and his acceptance of sinners. It sounds well to me as an effort to attract lots of people
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.940]   into the church. At the same time, they don't celebrate repentance and obedience. What do
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.860]   you think of a church that doesn't preach against particular sins?"
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:08.100]   I think that church is profoundly defective. It is unfaithful to the Word of God. Over
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:19.060]   and over, issue after issue, controversy after controversy, sin after sin is traced back
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:28.780]   up the stream to the watershed issue of, do leaders and people treasure the Word of God
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.340]   above gold? Do they savor the Word of God as sweeter than honey? And do they submit
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.100]   to the Word of God gladly in its truth and in its proportions? That's the watershed issue
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.500]   over and over again, Tony, that I'm seeing in these days as it is right here. So why
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.900]   would pastors presume to be wiser than the Scriptures in the way they speak to God's
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:08.100]   people? That baffles me. And yet over and over, I find that to be the case on this issue
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.820]   and other issues. Church leaders think they know better than the pattern of the Scriptures
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:27.060]   themselves. So let me give four reasons from the Bible why it is defective, why it is unfaithful
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.820]   not to explicitly name, denounce, and call for repentance from specific sins that are
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.460]   in the world and in the church. First, whether you look at the prophets in the Old Testament
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.460]   or Jesus preaching before the crucifixion or the apostles preaching after the crucifixion
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.420]   and after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, wherever you look in biblical preaching, God's
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:06.780]   spokesman included not only the glorious good news of forgiveness for sins, but also a blood
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.620]   earnest denunciation of sinning and specific sins and a call for repentance and obedience
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.700]   in the power of God's grace. For example, Malachi 3.5, to look to the prophets, "I
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.460]   will be swift witness. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers,
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.100]   against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hard worker in his wages,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.260]   the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner. And do not
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.500]   fear me," says the Lord. In other words, they named the sins. That's the way they preached.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.380]   Or take Jesus on the sin of lust. "If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out,
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.600]   throw it away," Matthew 5.29. Or greed, "Woe to you that are rich, for you have received
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.660]   your consolation," Luke 6.24. Or hypocrisy, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,"
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:13.900]   Matthew 23.29. Or take Paul, "Flee from sexual immorality," 1 Corinthians 6.18. "Do not be
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.340]   deceived, neither sexually immoral or idolaters or adulterers or men who practice homosexuality
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.580]   or thieves or greedy or drunkards or revilers or swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:38.020]   So prophets, Jesus, the apostles, this is the way they preached. They named sins and
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.700]   they denounced them and they called for repentance and obedience in the power of the glorious
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.960]   good news of forgiveness that they preached. So if a pastor wants to find an authority
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.060]   for preaching that does not name and denounce and call for repentance from sins, he's not
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.140]   going to find it in the Bible. But there's something even more important than the fact
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.620]   that in all biblical preaching, sins are named. The New Testament reveals that the actual
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.980]   way that sanctification works—and I presume these pastors want their people to be holy
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:26.060]   and loving and good and beautiful representatives of Jesus—the way that actually comes about
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:37.780]   is by a combination of God's conquering sin by divine action together with God's command
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:46.740]   to kill sin in reliance on that divine action. That's the pattern. It's unbiblical to separate
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.940]   God's conquering of sin and his command for us to kill it.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.940]   Now let me give you three illustrations of that pattern of sanctification. This is the
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.060]   more fundamental problem. These pastors just don't get how God works. That's their problem.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.500]   They're making it up as they go along instead of submitting to the pattern of how sanctification
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.780]   actually works. And so they're cutting the legs out from under their own gold to make
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.380]   a beautiful people. Number one, let's take the cross, then let's take new birth, and
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.380]   then let's take the fruit of the Holy Spirit. So how does the cross work to get sin out
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.540]   of our lives and make us holy? How does new birth work? And how does the fruit of the
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.860]   Holy Spirit work?
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.420]   Peter—let's cross first. Let's go to the cross. Peter says in 1 Peter 2.24, "He himself
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:49.320]   bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness."
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:59.220]   So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but that it might die in the lives of his people.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:08.820]   But that glorious triumph of Jesus over sin's power on the cross is given as the basis in
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:17.180]   1 Peter, the basis of verses 22 and 23. "Don't revile when you are reviled. Don't threaten
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:26.260]   when you suffer." In other words, Peter did not assume that the way the cross kills sin,
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:35.740]   the sin of reviling and threatening, was automatic. Instead, he named the sin, he called for obedience
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:44.020]   on the basis of the cross and the power of the cross. Christ conquered vengeance on the
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:52.860]   cross for his people. Then he commanded us on the basis of his conquering not to revile
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.540]   those who revile us, not to threaten those who cause us to suffer, not to return evil
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:06.940]   for evil. That's how we are made new. The divine sin-destroying work of Christ and the
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:14.580]   divine sin-naming, sin-denouncing word of Christ. That's the pattern. The conquering
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:22.660]   of Christ, the command to kill it, the work of God and the word of God to name it and
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.860]   put it to death. Here's the second illustration, the new birth.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:34.360]   Peter says in 1 Peter 1.23 to Christians, "You have been born again, not of perishable
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.860]   seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God." So there, that's
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:48.260]   the decisive divine work in us to make us new, turn us into the kind of people who hate
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:55.220]   sin and love righteousness. That's the work of the new birth. Hate the dark, love the
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.660]   light, turn from Satan, embrace Christ. That was worked for us by the Spirit in the new
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:10.100]   birth. But three verses later he says, "So," in other words, on the basis of this new birth,
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:19.900]   "So because this miracle has happened in your life, put away malice, deceit, hypocrisy,
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:28.580]   envy, all slander." Now we might ask, maybe these pastors ask, "Why? Why, if we're
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:37.980]   born again and we have the divine DNA in us to make us holy, inclining us away from sin,
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:44.740]   inclining us to love God, why, Peter? Why, Mr. Apostle, inspired by God Almighty, why
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:51.700]   would you bother to name sins and tell us to put them away?" And the answer is, because
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:10:01.820]   that's the way God has designed for sanctification to work. Christ conquers sins by the new birth,
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:09.500]   and then he commands us to kill what he has conquered. He does not say, "Christ conquered
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.220]   it, so I never need to name it anymore. I never need to summon my people into battle
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.640]   against their sins." No, that's not the way God designed it. These pastors are making
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.780]   it up as they go along. They're not submitting to God's way in the Bible.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:33.340]   One more illustration, namely the fruit of the Spirit. I remember back in Germany, goodness,
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:40.940]   a hundred years ago when I was studying there, sitting in my pantry wrestling with this very
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.780]   issue of how the Word of God and the fruit of the Spirit related to each other. Galatians
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.420]   5:22, Paul says, "The fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, and all the rest,
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.620]   all nine of them, those who belong to Christ," he says, "have crucified the flesh with its
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.460]   passions and desires." The Spirit is going to bear fruit in your life, so you are dead
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.340]   with Christ and the Spirit is alive and bearing fruit in your life. Ah, what a beautiful,
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:13.180]   positive, positive, positive way to look at the Christian life. Let's preach that and
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.660]   only that. Well, you can be unbiblical if you want to. Make it up as you go along. Draw
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.980]   inferences that the Bible doesn't draw. That's not a good way to minister. So we might think,
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.500]   "Well, that's all we need. We've got the Holy Spirit. We've got the cross. We've got the
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:41.040]   new birth. Just love, joy, peace." Paul, in the preceding verses, names, he names 15 works
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.500]   of the flesh. I'll read them. The works of the flesh are evident. Sexual immorality,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:56.020]   impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries,
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:04.380]   tensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like that, in case I missed any.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.980]   And then he adds, "For the sake of Christians to hear." Now, this is what these pastors
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.180]   are not doing. Paul thinks this is essential. He says, "I warn you. I warn you, Christians
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:21.160]   in Galatia, as I warned you before, I've done this before, that those who do such things
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:28.700]   will not inherit the kingdom of God. So I ask again, why name the works of the flesh
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.980]   and tell us not to do them if the fruits of the Spirit are mightily at work in our lives?
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.580]   Why? That's what I wrestled with those hundred years ago. The answer is, that's the way God
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:50.900]   designed it to work. Don't try to be smarter than God. God conquers our sins by the Spirit.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:13:01.280]   And commands that we kill those sins by means of the Spirit. That's the biblical pattern.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:11.980]   So I conclude that a church that fails to name sins, denounce them, call for repentance,
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:19.780]   puts human wisdom above divine wisdom by ignoring the way the prophets, Jesus, and the apostles
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:29.860]   preached and by failing to grasp how sanctification in the Bible really works. How the cross,
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:38.300]   the new birth, the fruit of the Holy Spirit actually conquers sin through God's command
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.860]   for us to kill it.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.100]   Hard words, but necessary ones. Necessary for our joy. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.020]   you for listening to the podcast today. And thank you for supporting DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.780]   And this podcast, Ask Pastor John, even with all the disruptions in this crazy year, ministry
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.940]   has been full throttle for us in 2020. In fact, it feels like the Lord has given us
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.520]   even more work to do this year in addressing the pandemic, particularly with the international
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.140]   launch of Pastor John's new book, Coronavirus and Christ. We're investing tens of thousands
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.540]   of dollars to get that timely book translated and distributed around the world in 29 different
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.140]   languages, and possibly even more to come.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.740]   And all of this at a time when so many organizations are forced to cut staff and slash budgets.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.220]   Instead, we are actually spending more money than ever to freely give away the best news
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.340]   in the world. And all of our ministry, the website, the books from Pastor John, and of
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.740]   course, this podcast, all of it is possible because God continues to raise up generous
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:42.540]   ministry partners around us, people who regularly pray for us and who donate to support all
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.940]   of our work.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:49.060]   If that's you, thank you for your partnership. We can't do this without you. And if this
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.980]   is not you, maybe you've been a listener to the podcast or a reader of the website for
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.300]   a while, or maybe you've downloaded the book by Pastor John or watched our free YouTube
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.700]   videos online. Maybe you've been blessed by all the content that our partners have made
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.580]   free of charge to you in the past. And now maybe you want to become someone who will
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.840]   now make those resources available to a new generation who will experience all of Pastor
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:17.540]   John and Desiring God's content free of charge. If that's you, now is a great time to join
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   us as our fiscal year ends in June and our new fiscal year begins in July, and we dream
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.380]   about all the new resources we want to make in the year ahead and new audiences we want
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:37.180]   to reach, too. If you want to join us, go online to DesiringGod.org/donate. That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
