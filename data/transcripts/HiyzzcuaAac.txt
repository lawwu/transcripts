[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.960]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.200]   For today's podcast,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.160]   we're going to talk about the parts list
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.720]   of the nervous system.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.360]   Now that might sound boring,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.320]   but these are the bits and pieces that together
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.640]   make up everything about your experience of life,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.840]   from what you think about, to what you feel,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.920]   what you imagine, and what you accomplish
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.600]   from the day you're born until the day you die.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.020]   By the end of this podcast,
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.920]   I promise you're going to understand a lot more
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.780]   about how you work and how to apply that knowledge.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.240]   So let's talk about the nervous system.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.480]   The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.820]   is because your brain is actually just one piece
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.840]   of this larger, more important thing, frankly,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.640]   that we call the nervous system.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.700]   The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord,
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.440]   but also all the connections between your brain
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320]   and your spinal cord and the organs of your body.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.000]   It also includes, very importantly,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.280]   all the connections between your organs
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.320]   back to your spinal cord and brain.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.000]   So the way to think about how you function at every level
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.860]   from the moment you're born until the day you die,
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.680]   everything you think and remember and feel and imagine
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.360]   is that your nervous system
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.680]   is this continuous loop of communication
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.080]   between the brain, spinal cord, and body,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.000]   and body, spinal cord, and brain.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.680]   In fact, we really can't even separate them.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.960]   It's one continuous loop.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.280]   The way to think about how the nervous system works
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.040]   is that our experiences, our memories, everything
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560]   is sort of like the keys on a piano
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.960]   being played in a particular order, right?
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560]   If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.040]   and with a particular intensity, that's a given song.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.400]   We can make that analogous to a given experience.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.360]   Our brain is really a map of our experience.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   We come into the world and our brain has a kind of bias
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.040]   towards learning particular kinds of things.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.960]   It's ready to receive information
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.520]   and learn that information,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   but the brain is really a map of experience.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.480]   So let's talk about what experience really is.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.280]   What does it mean for your brain to work?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.440]   Well, I think it's fair to say
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.160]   that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.040]   The first one is sensation.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.880]   Sensation is a non-negotiable element of your nervous system.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.320]   You have neurons in your eye
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.800]   that perceive certain colors of light
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.580]   and certain directions of movement.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.560]   You have neurons in your skin
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.080]   that perceive particular kinds of touch,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.440]   like light touch or firm touch or painful touch.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.240]   Your entire experience of life is filtered
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.000]   by these, what we call sensory receptors,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.240]   if you want to know what the name is.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.400]   Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.560]   and focus on it and make sense of it,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.180]   to explore it, to remember it.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.800]   So really perceptions are just whichever sensations
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.280]   we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.720]   Perception is under the control of your attention.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   And the way to think about attention
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.600]   is it's like a spotlight, except it's not one spotlight.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200]   You actually have two attentional spotlights.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.560]   Anyone that tells you you can't multitask,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.960]   tell them they're wrong.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.980]   And if they disagree with you, tell them to contact me.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.980]   Because in old world primates, of which humans are,
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.200]   we are able to do what's called covert attention.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.880]   We can place a spotlight of attention on something,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.300]   for instance, something we're reading or looking at,
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.600]   or someone that we're listening to.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.720]   And we can place a second spotlight of attention
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.880]   on something we're eating and how it tastes,
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.080]   or our child running around in the room,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.200]   or my dog.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.520]   You can split your attention into two locations,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.460]   but of course you can also bring your attention,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.960]   that is your perception, to one particular location.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.400]   You can dilate your attention,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.600]   kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.640]   or you can make it more concentrated.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.440]   This is very important to understand
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.400]   if you're going to think about tools
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.480]   to improve your nervous system.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.000]   Attention is something that is absolutely
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   under your control.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.740]   The nervous system can be reflexive in its action,
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.860]   or it can be deliberate.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.200]   Deliberate thoughts are top down.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.580]   They require some effort and some focus,
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.440]   but that's the point.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.120]   You can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.200]   but it will always feel like it requires some effort
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.060]   and some strain.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.400]   Whereas when you're in reflexive mode,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.320]   just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.880]   it's going to feel very easy.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.440]   And that's because your nervous system basically wired up
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.480]   to be able to do most things easily
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.120]   without much metabolic demand,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.660]   without consuming much energy.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.360]   But the moment you try and do something very specific,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.460]   you're going to feel a sort of mental friction.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.040]   It's going to be challenging.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.560]   So we've got sensations, perceptions,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   and then we've got things that we call feelings/emotions.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.040]   And these get a little complicated
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.400]   because almost all of us,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   I would hope all of us,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.620]   are familiar with things like happiness and sadness
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.080]   or boredom or frustration.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.100]   Certainly emotions and feelings
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.380]   are the product of the nervous system.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.920]   They involve the activity of neurons.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.860]   But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are electrically active,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.040]   but they also release chemicals.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.240]   And there's a certain category of chemicals
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.500]   that has a very profound influence on our emotional states.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.800]   They're called neuromodulators.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.400]   And those neuromodulators have names
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.020]   that probably you've heard of before,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.240]   things like dopamine and serotonin
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.280]   and acetylcholine, epinephrine.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.720]   Neuromodulators are really interesting
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.120]   because they bias which neurons are likely to be active
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.040]   and which ones are likely to be inactive.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.080]   A simple way to think about neuromodulators
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.320]   is they are sort of like playlists
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.080]   that you would have on any kind of device
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.560]   where you're going to play particular categories of music.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.200]   So for instance, dopamine,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.320]   is involved in reward.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.400]   And it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.780]   when released in appropriate amounts in the brain.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.320]   But the reason it does that
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.480]   is because it makes certain neurons and neural circuits,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.280]   as we call them, more active and others less active, okay?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.700]   So serotonin, for instance,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.520]   is a molecule that when released
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   tends to make us feel really good with what we have,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   our sort of internal landscape
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.000]   and the resources that we have.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.680]   Whereas dopamine, more than being a molecule of reward,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   is really more a molecule of motivation
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.760]   toward things that are outside us
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.120]   and that we want to pursue.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.840]   And we can look at healthy conditions or situations
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.760]   like being in pursuit of a goal
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.600]   where every time we accomplish something
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   in route to that goal,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.040]   a little bit of dopamine is released
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.840]   and we feel more motivation, that happens.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   We can also look at the extreme example
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.480]   of something like mania,
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   where somebody is so, you know,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.880]   relentlessly in pursuit of external things
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.920]   like money and relationships
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.300]   that they're sort of in this delusional state
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.540]   of thinking that they have the resources that they need
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.680]   in order to pursue all these things
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.920]   when in fact they don't.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.460]   I want to emphasize also that emotions
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.200]   are something that we generally feel
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.440]   are not under our control.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.320]   We feel like they kind of geyser up within us
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.400]   and they just kind of happen to us.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.100]   And that's because they are somewhat reflexive.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.680]   We don't really set out with a deliberate thought
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.000]   to be happy or deliberate thought to be sad.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.320]   We tend to experience them
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.080]   in kind of a passive reflexive way.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.040]   And that brings us to the next thing, which are thoughts.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.240]   Thoughts are really interesting
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.960]   because in many ways they're like perceptions,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.560]   except that they draw on not just what's happening
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.520]   in the present, but also things we remember from the past
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.040]   and things that we anticipate about the future.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.960]   The other thing about thoughts that's really interesting
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.720]   is that thoughts can be both reflexive,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.600]   they can just be occurring all the time,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.340]   sort of like pop-up windows
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.860]   on a poorly filtered web browser,
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.400]   or they can be deliberate.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.940]   We can decide to have a thought.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.660]   And a lot of people don't understand
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.900]   or at least appreciate that the thought patterns
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.700]   and the neural circuits that underlie thoughts
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.140]   can actually be controlled in this deliberate way.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.640]   And then finally, there are actions.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.460]   Actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.560]   to our nervous system, because first of all,
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.900]   our behaviors are actually the only thing
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.820]   that are going to create any fossil record of our existence.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.420]   You know, after we die, the nervous system deteriorates,
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.460]   our skeleton will remain, but it's, you know,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.820]   in the moment of experiencing something very joyful
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.820]   or something very sad, it can feel so all-encompassing
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.220]   that we actually think that it has some meaning
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.460]   beyond that moment.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.300]   But actually for humans, and I think for all species,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.780]   the sensations, the perceptions, and the thoughts,
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.060]   and the feelings that we have in our lifespan,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.020]   none of that is actually carried forward,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.020]   except the ones that we take and we convert into actions
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.740]   such as writing, actions such as words,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.980]   actions such as engineering new things.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.860]   And so the fossil record of our species
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.360]   and of each one of us is really through action.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.620]   And that in part is why so much of our nervous system
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.140]   is devoted to converting sensation, perceptions, feelings,
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.020]   and thoughts into actions.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.220]   The other way to think about it is that one of the reasons
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.980]   that our central nervous system, our brain and spinal cord
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.800]   include this stuff in our skull,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.980]   but also connect so heavily to the body
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.660]   is because most everything that we experience,
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.460]   including our thoughts and feelings,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.780]   was really designed to either impact our behavior or not.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.620]   And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.860]   and anticipate the future and not just experience
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.580]   what's happening in the moment,
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.380]   gave rise to an incredible capacity for us
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.700]   to engage in behaviors that are not just for the moment,
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.780]   they're based on things that we know from the past
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.780]   and that we would like to see in the future.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.660]   And this aspect to our nervous system of creating movement
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.340]   occurs through some very simple pathways.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.020]   The reflexive pathway basically includes areas
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.860]   of the brainstem we call central pattern generators.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.900]   When you walk, provided you already know how to walk,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.960]   you are basically walking
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.860]   because you have these central pattern generators,
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.020]   groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot,
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.900]   right foot, left foot kind of movement.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.440]   However, when you decide to move
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.040]   in a particular deliberate way
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.100]   that requires a little more attention,
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.380]   you start to engage areas of your brain
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.740]   for top-down processing,
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.500]   where your forebrain works from the top down
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.460]   to control those central pattern generators
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.700]   so that maybe it's right foot, right foot, left foot,
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.820]   right foot, right foot, left foot,
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.980]   if maybe you're hiking along some rocks or something
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.420]   and you have to engage in that kind of movement.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.860]   So movement is just like thoughts,
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.300]   can be either reflexive or deliberate.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.860]   And when we talk about deliberate,
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.940]   I want to be very specific
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.620]   about how your brain works in a deliberate way
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.300]   because it gives rise to a very important feature
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.100]   of the nervous system that we're going to talk about next,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.100]   which is your ability to change your nervous system.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.020]   And what I'd like to center on for a second
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.820]   is this notion of what does it mean for the nervous system
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.940]   to do something deliberately?
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.340]   Well, when you do something deliberately,
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.540]   you pay attention, you are bringing your perception
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.300]   to an analysis of three things,
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.540]   duration, how long something is going to take
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.020]   or should be done,
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.100]   path, what you should be doing,
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.120]   and outcome, if you do something
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.460]   for a given length of time, what's going to happen.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.380]   Now, when you're walking down the street or you're eating,
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.060]   or you're just talking reflexively,
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.100]   you're not doing this, what I call DPO,
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.580]   duration, path, outcome,
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.740]   type of deliberate function in your brain and nervous system.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.220]   Let's give an example where perhaps somebody says something
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.420]   that's triggering to you, you don't like it,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.420]   and you know you shouldn't respond.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.060]   You feel like, "Oh, I shouldn't respond,
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.460]   I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond."
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.920]   You're actively suppressing your behavior
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.700]   through top-down processing.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.660]   Your forebrain is actually preventing you
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.420]   from saying the thing that you know you shouldn't say
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.860]   or that maybe you should wait to say
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.620]   or say in a different form.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.840]   This feels like agitation and stress
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.180]   because you're actually suppressing a circuit.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.500]   We actually can see examples of what happens
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.160]   when you're not doing this well.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.040]   Some of the examples come from children.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.500]   If you look at young children,
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.980]   they don't have the forebrain circuitry
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.980]   to engage in this top-down processing
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.400]   until they reach age 22, even 25.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.140]   But in young children, you see this in a really robust way.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.340]   A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.400]   and will just reach out and grab it,
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.320]   whereas an adult probably would ask
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.160]   if they could have a piece
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.300]   or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.380]   People that have damage
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.300]   to the certain areas of the frontal lobes
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.860]   don't have this kind of restriction.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.320]   They'll just blurt things out.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.300]   They'll just say things.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.260]   Impulsivity is a lack of top-down control,
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.940]   a lack of top-down processing.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.300]   So a lot of the motor system
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.180]   is designed to just work in a reflexive way.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.140]   And then when we decide we want to learn something
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.540]   or do something or not do something,
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.060]   we have to engage in this top-down restriction.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.660]   And it feels like agitation
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.540]   because it's accompanied by the release
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.460]   of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine,
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.460]   which in the body we call adrenaline,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.700]   and it actually makes us feel agitated.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.340]   So for those of you that are trying to learn something new
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.500]   or to learn to suppress your responses
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.460]   or be more deliberate and careful in your responses,
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.840]   that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.920]   It's going to feel challenging
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.520]   because the chemicals in your body
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.780]   that are released in association with that effort
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.060]   are designed to make you feel kind of agitated.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.180]   And so this is really important to understand
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.440]   because if you want to understand neuroplasticity,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.460]   you want to understand how to shape your behavior,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.540]   how to shape your thinking,
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.420]   how to change how you're able to perform in any context.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.300]   The most important thing to understand
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.460]   is that it requires top-down processing.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.460]   It requires this feeling of agitation.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.960]   In fact, I would say that agitation and strain
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   is the entry point to neuroplasticity.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.680]   So let's take a look at what neuroplasticity is.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.560]   Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.640]   in the brain and body to change in response to experience.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.880]   And what's so incredible
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.080]   about the human nervous system in particular
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.160]   is that we can direct our own neural changes.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.480]   We can decide that we want to change our brain.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.600]   In other words, our brain can change itself
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.840]   and our nervous system can change itself.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.000]   For a long time, it was thought that neuroplasticity
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.080]   was the unique gift of young animals and humans,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.840]   that it could only occur when we're young.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   And in fact, the young brain is incredibly plastic.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.620]   Children can learn three languages
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.800]   without an accent reflexively,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.460]   whereas adults, it's very challenging.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.160]   It takes a lot more effort and strain,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.880]   a lot more of that duration path outcome kind of thinking
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.400]   in order to achieve those plastic changes.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.400]   We now know, however, that the adult brain
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   can change in response to experience.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.160]   In order to understand that process,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.080]   we really have to understand something
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.040]   that might at first seem totally divorced
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.400]   from neuroplasticity,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.440]   but actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.960]   And for any of you that are interested
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.560]   in changing your nervous system
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.320]   so that something that you want can go from being very hard
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.540]   or seem almost impossible and out of reach
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.440]   to being very reflexive,
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.220]   this is especially important to pay attention to.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.940]   Plasticity in the adult human nervous system is gated,
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.180]   meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.140]   These things that we talked about earlier,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.200]   dopamine, serotonin,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.780]   and one in particular called acetylcholine
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.460]   are what open up plasticity.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.740]   They literally unveil plasticity
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.180]   and allow brief periods of time
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.240]   in which whatever information,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.700]   whatever thing we're sensing or perceiving or thinking,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.540]   or whatever emotions we feel
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.820]   can literally be mapped in the brain
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.780]   such that later it will become much easier
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.460]   for us to experience and feel that thing.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.460]   Now, this has a dark side and a positive side.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.780]   The dark side is it's actually very easy
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.060]   to get neuroplasticity as an adult
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.940]   through traumatic or terrible or challenging experiences.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.260]   But the important question is to say, why is that?
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.200]   And the reason that's the case
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.800]   is because when something very bad happens,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.780]   there's the release of two sets of neuromodulators
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.240]   in the brain, epinephrine,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.800]   which tends to make us feel alert and agitated,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.720]   which is associated with most bad circumstances,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.280]   and acetylcholine,
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.680]   which tends to create a even more intense
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.600]   and focused perceptual spotlight.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.720]   Remember earlier we were talking about perception
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.360]   and how it's kind of like a spotlight.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.020]   Acetylcholine makes that light particularly bright
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.640]   and particularly restricted to one region of our experience.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.160]   And it does that by making certain neurons
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   in our brain and body active much more than all the rest.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.720]   So acetylcholine is sort of like a highlighter marker
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.320]   upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.360]   and says, wait, which neurons were active
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.800]   in this particularly alerting phase
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.920]   of whatever day or night
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.320]   whenever this thing happened to happen.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.440]   So the way it works is this,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.840]   you can think of epinephrine as creating this alertness
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.520]   and this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.200]   compared to what you were experiencing before.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.400]   And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.200]   that highlights whatever happens
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.960]   during that period of heightened alertness.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.280]   So just to be clear, it's epinephrine creates the alertness
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.360]   that's coming from a subset of neurons in the brainstem
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.480]   if you're interested,
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.460]   and acetylcholine coming from an area of the forebrain
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.140]   is tagging or marking the neurons
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.540]   that are particularly active
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.940]   during this heightened level of alertness.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.700]   Now that marks the cells, the neurons, and the synapses
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.940]   for strengthening, for becoming more likely
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.100]   to be active in the future
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.300]   even without us thinking about it, okay?
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.820]   So in bad circumstances,
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.140]   this all happens without us having to do much.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.580]   When we want something to happen, however,
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.080]   we want to learn a new language,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.720]   we want to learn a new skill,
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.880]   we want to become more motivated,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.060]   what do we know for certain?
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.880]   We know that that process of getting neuroplasticity
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.040]   so that we have more focus, more motivation
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.280]   absolutely requires the release of epinephrine.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.640]   We have to have alertness in order to have focus.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.400]   And we have to have focus
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.320]   in order to direct those plastic changes
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.200]   to particular parts of our nervous system.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.140]   Now, this has immense implications
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.740]   in thinking about the various tools,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.020]   whether or not those are chemical tools or machine tools
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.640]   or just self-induced regimens of how long
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.340]   or how intensely you're going to focus
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.400]   in order to get neuroplasticity.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.700]   But there's another side to it.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.460]   The dirty secret of neuroplasticity
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.140]   is that no neuroplasticity occurs
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.320]   during the thing you're trying to learn,
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.120]   during the terrible event, during the great event,
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.680]   during the thing that you're really trying to shape
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.840]   and learn, nothing is actually changing
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.720]   between the neurons that is going to last.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.160]   All the neuroplasticity, the strengthening of the synapses,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   the addition in some cases of new nerve cells
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.000]   or at least connections between nerve cells,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.440]   all of that occurs at a very different phase of life,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.420]   which is when we are in sleep and non-sleep deep rest.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.820]   And so neuroplasticity,
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.460]   which is the kind of holy grail of human experience,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.980]   of, you know, this is the new year
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.820]   and everyone's thinking New Year's resolutions.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.460]   And right now, perhaps everything's organized
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.940]   and people are highly motivated,
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.700]   but what happens in March or April or May?
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.980]   Well, that all depends on how much attention and focus
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.400]   one can continually bring to whatever it is
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.620]   they're trying to learn.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.860]   So much so that agitation and a feeling of strain
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.940]   are actually required for this process of neuroplasticity
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.180]   to get triggered.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.780]   But the actual rewiring occurs
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.180]   during periods of sleep and non-sleep deep rest.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.560]   There's a study published last year
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.820]   that's particularly relevant here that I want to share.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.820]   It was not done by my laboratory
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.820]   that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.460]   this is not deep sleep,
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.380]   but essentially doing something very hard and very intense
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.700]   and then taking 20 minutes afterward,
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.840]   immediately afterwards to deliberately turn off
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.220]   the deliberate focused thinking and engagement
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.980]   actually accelerated neuroplasticity.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.200]   There's another study that's just incredible,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.260]   and we're going to go into this
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.700]   in a future episode of the podcast, not too long from now,
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.700]   that showed that if people are learning a particular skill,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.340]   it could be a language skill or a motor skill,
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.020]   and they hear a tone just playing in the background,
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.060]   the tone is playing periodically through the background,
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.980]   like just a bell.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.100]   In deep sleep, if that bell is played,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.240]   learning is much faster for the thing
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.740]   that they were learning while they were awake.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.140]   It somehow cues the nervous system in sleep,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.080]   doesn't even have to be in dreaming,
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.540]   that something that happened in the waking phase
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.020]   was especially important,
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.140]   so much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue,
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.840]   it's sort of a reminder to the sleeping brain,
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.140]   oh, you need to remember what it is that you were learning
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.220]   at that particular time of day,
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.380]   and the learning rates and the rates of retention,
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.760]   meaning how much people can remember
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.940]   from the thing they learned,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.360]   are significantly higher under those conditions.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.060]   So I'm going to talk about how to apply all this knowledge
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.640]   in a little bit more in this podcast episode,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.460]   but also in future episodes,
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.700]   but it really speaks to the really key importance
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.140]   of sleep and focus,
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.300]   these two opposite ends of our attentional state.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   When we're in sleep, these DPOs,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.940]   duration, path, and outcome analysis are impossible.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.320]   We just can't do that.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.940]   We are only in relation to what's happening inside of us.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.900]   So sleep is key.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.620]   Also key are periods of non-sleep deep rest
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.500]   where we're turning off our analysis
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.100]   of duration, path, and outcome,
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.700]   in particular for the thing
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.660]   that we were just trying to learn,
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.780]   and we're in this kind of liminal state
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.020]   where our attention is kind of drifting all over.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.660]   It turns out that's very important for the consolidation,
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.900]   for the changes between the nerve cells
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.100]   that will allow what we were trying to learn
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.660]   to go from being deliberate and hard and stressful
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.800]   and a strain to easy and reflexive.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.760]   This also points to how different people,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.660]   including many modern clinicians,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.380]   are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.220]   traumas from routing their way
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.820]   into our nervous system permanently.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.080]   It says that you might want to interfere
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.720]   with certain aspects of brain states
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.460]   that are away from the bad thing that happened,
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.100]   the brain states that happened the next day
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.340]   or the next month or the next year.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.300]   And also I want to make sure
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.740]   that I pay attention to the fact that for many of you,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.140]   you're thinking about neuroplasticity
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.420]   not just in changing your nervous system
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.900]   to add something new,
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.420]   but to also get rid of things that you don't like, right?
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.620]   That you want to forget bad experiences
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.020]   or at least remove the emotional contingency
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.460]   of a bad relationship
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.520]   or a bad relationship to something
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.480]   or some person or some event.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.880]   Learning to fear certain things less,
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.300]   to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.520]   The memories themselves don't get erased.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.240]   I'm sorry to say that the memories don't,
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.300]   themselves get erased,
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.160]   but the emotional load of memories can be reduced.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.440]   And there are a number of different ways
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.720]   that that can happen,
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.160]   but they all require this thing
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.040]   that we're calling neuroplasticity.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.440]   We're going to have a large number of discussions
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.540]   about neuroplasticity in depth,
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.980]   but the most important thing to understand
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.940]   is that it is indeed a two-phase process.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.780]   What governs the transition between alert and focused
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.340]   and these depressed and deep sleep states
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.780]   is a system in our brain and body,
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.380]   a certain aspect of the nervous system
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.980]   called the autonomic nervous system.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.340]   And it is immensely important to understand
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.780]   how this autonomic nervous system works.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.940]   It has names like the sympathetic nervous system
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.260]   and parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.920]   which frankly are complicated names
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.280]   because they're a little bit misleading.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.120]   Sympathetic is the one that's associated
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.960]   with more alertness,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.600]   parasympathetic is the one that's associated
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.280]   with more calmness.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.640]   And it gets really misleading
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.880]   because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.400]   and then people think it's related to calm.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.960]   I'm going to call it the alertness system
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.720]   and the calmness system,
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.240]   because even though sympathetic and parasympathetic
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.920]   are sometimes used, people really get confused.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.240]   So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.480]   and the reason it's important for every aspect of your life,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.440]   but in particular for neuroplasticity
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.500]   and engaging in these focused states
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.160]   and then these defocused states
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.400]   is that it works sort of like a seesaw.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.540]   Every 24 hours, we're all familiar with the fact
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.720]   that when we wake up in the morning,
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.840]   we might be a little bit groggy,
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.520]   but then generally we're more alert.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.680]   And then as evening comes around,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.720]   we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleepy
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.180]   and eventually at some point at night we go to sleep.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.400]   So we go from alert to deeply calm.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.920]   And as we do that, we go from an ability to engage
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   in these very focused duration path outcome
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.820]   types of analyses to states in sleep
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.000]   that are completely divorced from duration path and outcome
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.360]   in which everything is completely random and untethered
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.160]   in terms of our sensations, perceptions,
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.580]   and feelings and so forth.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.040]   So every 24 hours, we have a phase of our day
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.760]   that is optimal for thinking and focusing
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.960]   and learning and neuroplasticity
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.300]   and doing all sorts of things.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.200]   We have energy as well.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.440]   And at another phase of our day,
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.920]   we're tired and we have no ability to focus.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.720]   We have no ability to engage
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.360]   in duration path outcome types of analyses.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.480]   And it's interesting that both phases are important
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.140]   for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.120]   So if we want to engage neuroplasticity
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.800]   and we want to get the most out of our nervous system,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.240]   we each have to master both the transition
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.360]   between wakefulness and sleep
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.020]   and the transition between sleep and wakefulness.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.420]   Now, so much has been made of the importance of sleep
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.060]   and it is critically important for wound healing,
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.580]   for learning, as I just mentioned,
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.540]   for consolidating learning,
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.860]   for all aspects of our immune system.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.020]   It is the one period of time
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.660]   in which we're not doing these duration path
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.260]   and outcomes types of analyses.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.700]   And it is critically important to all aspects of our health,
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.080]   including our longevity.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.620]   Much less has been made, however,
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.340]   of how to get better at sleeping,
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.300]   how to get better at the process
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.160]   that involves falling asleep, staying asleep,
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.600]   and accessing the states of mind and body
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.260]   that involve total paralysis.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.100]   Most people don't know this,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.420]   but you're actually paralyzed during much of your sleep
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.060]   so that you can't act out your dreams, presumably.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.340]   But also where your brain is in a total idle state
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.540]   where it's not controlling anything,
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.600]   it's just left to kind of free run.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.420]   And there are certain things that we can all do
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.940]   in order to master that transition,
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.900]   in order to get better at sleeping.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.220]   And it involves much more than just how much we sleep.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.920]   We're all being told, of course, that we need to sleep more,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.300]   but there's also the issue of sleep quality,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.860]   accessing those deep states of non-DPO thinking,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.620]   accessing the right timing of sleep.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.340]   Not a lot has been discussed publicly
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.100]   as far as I'm aware of when to time your sleep.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.980]   I think we all can appreciate
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.380]   that sleeping for half an hour throughout the day
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.500]   so that you get a total of eight hours of sleep
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.560]   every 24 hour cycle is probably very different
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.740]   and not optimal compared to a solid block
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.880]   of eight hours of sleep.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.420]   Although there are people that have tried this.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.340]   I think it's been written about in various books.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.000]   Not many people can stick to that schedule.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.100]   Incidentally, I think it's called the Uberman schedule,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.580]   not to be confused with the Huberman schedule,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.740]   because first of all, my schedule
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.820]   doesn't look anything like that.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.640]   And second of all,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.040]   I would never attempt such a sleeping regime.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.380]   The other thing that is really important to understand
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.380]   is that we have not explored as a culture,
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.380]   the rhythms that occur in our waking states.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.780]   So much has been focused on the value of sleep
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.980]   and the importance of sleep, which is great.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.460]   But I don't think that most people are paying attention
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.260]   to what's happening in their waking states
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.060]   and when their brain is optimized for focus,
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.420]   when their brain is optimized for these DPOs,
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.660]   these duration path outcome types of engagements
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.740]   for learning and for changing.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.860]   And when their brain is probably better suited
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.100]   for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.060]   And it turns out that there's a vast amount
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.900]   of scientific data which points to the existence
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.980]   of what are called ultradian rhythms.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.300]   You may have heard of circadian rhythms.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.180]   Circadian means circa about a day.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.660]   So it's 24 hour rhythms
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.620]   'cause the earth spins once every 24 hours.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.180]   Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.180]   and they require less time, they're shorter.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.660]   The most important ultradian rhythm
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.180]   for sake of this discussion is the 90 minute rhythm
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.540]   that we're going through all the time
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.540]   in our ability to attend and focus.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.940]   And in sleep, our sleep is broken up
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.040]   into 90 minute segments.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   Early in the night, we have more phase one
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.500]   and phase two lighter sleep.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.100]   And then we go into our deeper phase three
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.940]   and phase four sleep.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.060]   And then we return to phase one, two, three, four.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.720]   So all night you're going through these ultradian rhythms
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.900]   of stage one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.480]   It's repeating.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.260]   Most people perhaps know that, maybe they don't.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.660]   But when you wake up in the morning,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.820]   these ultradian rhythms continue.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.020]   And it turns out that we are optimized
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.020]   for focus and attention within these 90 minute cycles
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.340]   so that at the beginning of one of these 90 minute cycles,
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.020]   maybe you sit down to learn something new
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.240]   or to engage in some new challenging behavior.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.700]   For the first five or 10 minutes of one of those cycles,
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.340]   it's well known that the brain and the neural circuits
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:30.380]   and the neuromodulators are not going to be optimally tuned
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.620]   to whatever it is you're trying to do.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.100]   But as you drop deeper into that 90 minute cycle,
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.760]   your ability to focus and to engage in this DPO process
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.820]   and to direct neuroplasticity and to learn
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.220]   is actually much greater.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.700]   And then you eventually pop out of that
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.580]   at the end of the 90 minute cycle.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.660]   So these cycles are occurring in sleep
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.820]   and these cycles are occurring in wakefulness.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.500]   And all of those are governed by this seesaw
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.860]   of alertness to calmness
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.140]   that we call the autonomic nervous system.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.780]   So if you want to master and control your nervous system,
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.940]   regardless of what tool you reach to,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.580]   whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.180]   or whether or not it's a behavioral tool
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.500]   or whether or not it's a brain machine interface tool,
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.100]   it's vitally important to understand
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.100]   that your entire existence is occurring
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.680]   in these 90 minute cycles,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.540]   whether or not you're asleep or awake.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.060]   And so you really need to learn
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.140]   how to wedge into those 90 minute cycles.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.420]   And for instance, it would be completely crazy
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.560]   and counterproductive to try and just learn information
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.820]   while in deep sleep by listening to that information
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.980]   'cause you're not able to access it.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.860]   It would be perfectly good, however,
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.740]   to engage in a focus bout of learning each day.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.960]   And now we know how long
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.660]   that focus bout of learning should be.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.900]   It should be at least one 90 minute cycle.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.660]   And the expectation should be that the early phase
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.800]   of that cycle is going to be challenging.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.640]   It's going to hurt.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.820]   It's not going to feel natural.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.700]   It's not going to feel like flow,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.420]   but that you can learn.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.780]   And the circuits of your brain
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.680]   that are involved in focus and motivation
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.300]   can learn to drop in to a mode of more focus,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.900]   get more neuroplasticity in other words,
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.620]   by engaging these ultradian cycles
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.820]   at the appropriate times of day.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.040]   For instance, some people are very good learners
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.620]   early in the day and not so good in the afternoon.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.380]   So you can start to explore this process
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.180]   even without any information
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.580]   about the underlying neurochemicals
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.420]   by simply paying attention,
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.840]   not just to when you go to sleep
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.860]   and when you wake up each morning,
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.540]   how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively,
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.860]   but also throughout the day
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.980]   when your brain tends to be most anxious,
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.820]   because it turns out
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.540]   that has a correlate related to perception
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.340]   that we will talk about.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.700]   You can ask yourself, when are you most focused?
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.860]   When are you least anxious?
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.520]   When do you feel most motivated?
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.460]   When do you feel least motivated?
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.180]   By understanding how the different aspects
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.340]   of your perception, sensation, feeling, thought
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.560]   and actions tend to want to be engaged
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.000]   or not want to be engaged.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.440]   You develop a very good window
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.120]   into what's going to be required
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.100]   to shift your ability to focus
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.880]   or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.320]   at different times of day, should you choose.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.400]   And so that's where we're heading going forward.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.200]   It all starts with mastering this seesaw
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.980]   that is the autonomic nervous system
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.320]   that at a course level is a transition
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   between wakefulness and sleep.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.040]   But at a finer level and just as important
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.080]   are the various cycles,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.740]   these all trading 90 minute cycles
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.720]   that govern our life all the time,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.960]   24 hours a day, every day of our life.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.080]   And so we're going to talk about
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.600]   how you can take control of the autonomic nervous system
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   so that you can better access neuroplasticity,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.280]   better access sleep,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.200]   even take advantage of the phase
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.400]   that is the transition between sleep and waking
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.040]   to access things like creativity and so forth.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.400]   All based on studies that have been published
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.560]   over the last hundred years,
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.200]   mainly within the last 10 years
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.840]   and some that are very, very new
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.180]   and that point to the use of specific tools
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.920]   that will allow you to get the most
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.660]   out of your nervous system.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.160]   So today we covered a lot of information.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.960]   It was sort of a whirlwind tour
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.300]   of everything from neurons and synapses
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.980]   to neuroplasticity in the autonomic nervous system.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.760]   We will revisit a lot of these themes going forward.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.080]   So if all of that didn't sink in in one pass,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.980]   please don't worry.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.960]   We will come back to these themes over and over again.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.520]   I wanted to equip you with a language
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.820]   that we're all developing a kind of common base set
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.720]   of information going forward.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   And I hope the information is valuable to you
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.840]   and you're thinking about what is working well for you
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.920]   and what's working less well
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.560]   and what's been exceedingly challenging,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.160]   what's been easy for you in terms of your pursuit
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.840]   of particular behaviors or emotional states,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.800]   where your challenges or the challenges of people
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.000]   that you know might reside.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.940]   So thank you so much for your time and attention.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.540]   And above all, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.120]   [upbeat music]
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.700]   (upbeat music)
