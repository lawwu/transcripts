[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   In his 2008 sermon on Psalm 42, John Piper talked about spiritual depression.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.480]   Specifically, what should we do when the darkness of spiritual depression descends
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.760]   into our lives? Here are the third and fourth points of application John Piper
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.760]   draws from the text.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.880]   He sings to the Lord at night pleading for his life. This man is very strange.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.800]   He's so unusual. Oh, to be more like him in my pain. Verse 8, "By day the Lord
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   commands his steadfast love and at night," now watch this, "at night his song,"
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:52.760]   God's song, "is with me a prayer to the God of my life." What does that mean?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   It means that late at night, tears flowing down his face, he's singing a prayer to
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.840]   God for his life. You got my life? I got no other place to ask for help? I'm
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:13.960]   coming to you. And he sings it. Ever done that? We need to have a broad enough
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.440]   hymnology or musicology or whatever you call it these days so that you have a
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.760]   battery of songs that work on the greatest days of leaping and the worst
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:34.440]   days of collapse. You got a song. They're all over the Psalms. Probably the one we would
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.840]   sing around here. If somebody walked into a crisis situation at Bethlehem,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   they'd probably start singing "It is well with my soul." It's got the right
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.840]   tone to it. It's got "when sorrows like billows overtake my soul."
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.880]   Here's a couple. Isaac Watts wrote this. Now this is a Christian. This is
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.120]   post-Calvary. "How long wilt thou conceal thy face, my God, how long delay? When
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.600]   shall I feel those heavenly rays that chase my fears away? How long shall my
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.840]   poor laboring soul wrestle and toil in vain? Thy word can all my foes control
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.760]   and ease my raging pain." He wrote that to be sung, Isaac Watts did. Or here's
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.340]   another one from the 1912 Psalter. I think it's working with Psalm 13. "How
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.840]   long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, thou God of grace? How long shall fears beset
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.520]   me while darkness hides thy face? How long shall griefs distress me and turn
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.240]   my day to night? How long shall foes oppress me and triumph in their might?
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.000]   How, O Lord, my God, behold me and hear mine earnest cries, lest sleep of death
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.280]   enfold me, enlighten thou my eyes, lest now my foe insulting should boast of his
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.360]   success and enemies exulting rejoice in my distress." That's a good lament, but it
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:16.880]   does take a certain emotional wherewithal to sing when you're totally
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:28.360]   crushed. It's not a jubilant song. Don't think that song equals happy. Jubilant
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.440]   happy. These songs are not jubilant. This man is not jubilant. He wants to be
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.920]   jubilant. That's the whole point of the psalm. "I would like to be jubilant again
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.480]   and I'm not." And he's got a song to sing while he's not, and he sings it to God.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.560]   Number four, he preaches to his own soul. This is one of the most important lessons
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.600]   in life. Verse 5, "Why are you downcast, O my soul?" So he's talking to his soul. "Why
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.320]   are you downcast, O my soul? Why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God, for I
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.840]   shall again praise him, my salvation and my God." That's a crucial lesson to learn.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   Let me read you a paragraph from Martin Lloyd-Jones' book, "It is so Powerful."
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.600]   When I read this paragraph years ago, I thought, "Got to do that. Got to do more of
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.840]   that." Here's what he wrote. "Have you realized that most of your unhappiness in
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.760]   life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead of talking
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.520]   to yourself? Take those thoughts that come to you the moment you wake up in
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.240]   the morning. You have not originated them, but there they are, talking to you. They
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.920]   bring back the problems of yesterday. Somebody's talking. Who's talking? Your
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.600]   self is talking to you. Now this man's treatment in Psalm 42 was this. Instead
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.560]   of allowing this self to talk to him, he starts talking to himself. "Why are you
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   cast down, O my soul?" he asks. His soul had been depressing him, crushing him. So
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.780]   he stands up and says, "Self, listen for a moment. I will speak to you." Do you do
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:15.200]   that? I find that given the way I'm wired, much of my self-talk is very defeatist. I
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.080]   tell myself all kinds of bad news. I just... and I can imagine my bad self saying,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.960]   "You're supposed to be giving me good news. I've got the bad news." And I team up with
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.200]   my old self and say some more bad news. He's got bad news, I got bad news, and no
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.280]   wonder we get discouraged. And so here we are on this side of the cross. Jesus has
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.400]   come. How would you preach to yourself now? You preach the gospel to yourself. It goes
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   like this. Listen, self. This is Piper. Listen. If God is for you, who can be against you,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:12.560]   self? He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for you, self, will he not with
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.760]   him freely give us all things? Who should bring any charge against you, God's elect?
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:27.480]   Is it God who justifies self? No, it's Jesus who died, yes, who was raised, who's at the
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.120]   right hand of God who intercedes for you, self? What can separate you, self, from the
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.720]   love of God?
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.840]   Amen. This clip taken from John Piper's 2008 sermon, "Spiritual Depression in the Psalms,"
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   specifically the sermon on Psalm 42. This clip was sent in to us by Jonathan Pearson.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.040]   Thank you, Jonathan, for the clip. You can send us your clips and your questions via
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.480]   email. See desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn to connect with us via email. Well, everything
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.840]   about God is about everything. Yeah, that's what I said. Everything about God is about
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   everything. It doesn't get much more comprehensive than that. John Piper joins us tomorrow to
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.720]   explain. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   [END]
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   1. What is the greatest gift? The greatest gift is to be able to ask God. Ask God. Ask
