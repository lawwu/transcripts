[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   welcome to this 30-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol non-sleep deep rest is a powerful tool
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.680]   that can allow you to control the relaxation state of your nervous system and your overall
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.840]   state of mind it can restore mental and physical vigor and it can be done any time of day or night
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.840]   it can even partially offset the negative consequences of getting too little sleep
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.180]   non-sleep deep rest takes advantage of the fact that specific forms of breathing place us into a
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.520]   state of deep relaxation by slowing our heart rate down it also takes advantage of the fact that we can
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.880]   control our perception that is which sensations we are focused on sensations are simply the
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.520]   conversion of physical events in the world into a language that our body and brain can understand
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:13.980]   it's a process by which things like photons of light mechanical pressure on our skin sound waves and so
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:24.480]   on are converted to electrical and chemical signals in our neurons or nerve cells perception is simply
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.980]   the sensations that we happen to be focused on at a given moment and perception is an incredible aspect
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:40.980]   aspect of our nervous system we can't directly control what sensations are around us and inside of us they
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:50.980]   are just there but we can control our two kinds of perceptions one kind of perception is called exteroception
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:59.980]   perception and is when we pay attention to things around us beyond the confines of our skin the other type of
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.980]   perception is called interoception and it's when we pay attention to things at the level of the surface of
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:16.480]   our skin and inward inside our body with non sleep deep rest you can shift your brain state from one of
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:26.980]   thinking stress planning from anticipation of any kind positive or negative to one of pure sensation and deep
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:37.480]   relaxation it's very simple to do you'll want to do this protocol seated or lying down
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.980]   so if you're not already seated or lying down please do so now
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.980]   you'll also want to close your eyes so if your eyes aren't already closed please close them now
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.980]   throughout this protocol you'll want to breathe normally unless instructed to do otherwise
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:09.480]   one pattern of breathing you'll be asked to do is to inhale deeply ideally through your nose but if you can't do it
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   through your nose inhale through your mouth try that now inhale deeply through your nose and then exhale all of your air
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:37.980]   through your mouth let's do that again inhale deeply through your nose and then exhale completely through your mouth
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:49.980]   and as you exhale exhale through thinly pursed lips as if through a small straw let's repeat that two more times
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.980]   inhale deeply through your nose
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.980]   inhale deeply through your nose and then exhale completely through thinly pursed lips
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.980]   inhale deeply through your nose and then exhale completely through your mouth through thinly pursed lips
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:14.980]   inhale deeply through your nose and then exhale completely through your mouth through thinly pursed lips
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   as you do so imagine your entire body sinking into the surface that it's in contact with
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.980]   as you do so imagine your entire body sinking into the surface that it's in contact with
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.980]   now while continuing to breathe normally move your toes ever so slightly
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:58.980]   even though you moved your toes continue to keep your body completely relaxed allow for your forehead and your facial muscles to just drape
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:08.980]   if you need to breathe through your mouth as you do that that's fine
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.980]   otherwise continue to breathe through your nose and your mouth
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.980]   or purely through your mouth or purely through your nose
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:38.980]   now deliberately move one or two of your fingers on each hand
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:53.980]   and as you do so take notice of the fact that you made that decision you control your actions
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.980]   then allow your hands to be still once again
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.980]   then allow your hands to be still once again
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:15.980]   now let's repeat the pattern of breathing that you've done now several times before
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:26.980]   with a big deep inhale through the nose until your lungs are full
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:34.980]   and a long slow to lungs empty exhale through your mouth through thinly pursed lips
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:46.980]   as you do this
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.980]   several times over
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.980]   pay attention
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.980]   to the natural movement of your body
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.980]   your belly
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.980]   your belly expanding upward
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.980]   as you inhale
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.980]   and falling back down
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.980]   as you exhale
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.980]   notice that some of your body movements
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:23.980]   are created by your breathing
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.980]   but that you are still completely relaxed
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:39.980]   focus your attention
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980]   focus your attention
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   on your jaw
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.980]   notice
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.980]   if the muscles of your jaw
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.980]   have any tension within them
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.980]   and if they do
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.980]   on your next breath
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.980]   try to relax those muscles
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.980]   by 50%
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:16.980]   breathe in through your nose
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.980]   and out through your mouth
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.980]   allowing your jaw
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.980]   to relax
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.980]   and the skin
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.980]   and the muscles of your face
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.980]   to drape
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:43.980]   now for the next three breaths
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.980]   you're going to imagine
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.980]   you're going to imagine
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.980]   your entire body
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.980]   sinking
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.980]   deeper
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980]   and deeper still
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   into the surface
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.980]   that you are lying
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.980]   or sitting down on
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.980]   you may feel as if your body rises up a bit
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.980]   as you inhale
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:07.980]   you may feel as if your body rises up a bit
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.980]   as you inhale
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.980]   but as you exhale
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.980]   your body sinks down
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:25.980]   in your mind's eye
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.980]   imagine tracing
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   a big circle
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.980]   around your body
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.980]   from your head
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.980]   out and around your arms
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.980]   your legs
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.980]   your feet
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.980]   and up again the other side
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.980]   to the top of your head
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.980]   and up again the other side
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.980]   to the top of your head
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:58.980]   follow the path of that circle
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   one more time around
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:13.980]   one more time around
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.980]   now you will move your chin
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.980]   and head
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.980]   just slightly
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.980]   to the right-hand side
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.980]   to the right-hand side
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.980]   move it
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.980]   just a centimeter or so
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   and then move it back
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.980]   to center
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   now move your chin and head
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.980]   to the left side
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.980]   again
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.980]   again
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980]   about a centimeter
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.980]   or so
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.980]   and then back
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.980]   to the center
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:07.980]   you'll notice that you are in control of your nervous system
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.980]   you direct your perceptions
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   and your actions
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.980]   move your ankles
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   bend your knees
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.980]   just the slightest bit
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.980]   you can move your upper body
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.980]   from side to side
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.980]   move your head
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.980]   from side to side
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   or nod
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.980]   ever so slightly
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.980]   from side to side
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.980]   or nod
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.980]   ever so slightly
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:46.980]   breathing in that way
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.980]   that is inhaling deeply through your nose
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.980]   and then exhaling completely
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   through the mouth
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.980]   through thinly pursed lips
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.980]   is known to slow your heart rate down
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   and relax your nervous system
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.980]   feel free now
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.980]   to simply breathe normally
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.980]   now in your mind's eye
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.980]   imagine yourself standing over yourself
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.980]   looking at your body
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.980]   which is seated
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.980]   or lying down
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.980]   and imagine holding a flashlight
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.980]   or a spotlight
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.980]   and directing it
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.980]   at your feet
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.980]   focus your attention
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.980]   on whatever it is
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.980]   that your feet happen to be in contact with
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   it could be socks
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.980]   sandals
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.980]   shoes
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   or merely the air
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.980]   it doesn't matter
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.980]   focus your attention specifically
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.980]   on the bottoms of your feet
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.980]   and try to perceive
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   whatever it is
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.980]   they are sensing
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.980]   they could be tingling
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.980]   they could even be numb
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.980]   it doesn't matter
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.980]   now imagine expanding that spotlight
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.980]   to include the tops of your feet
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.980]   your shins
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.980]   your calves
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.980]   expanding that spotlight further
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.980]   to include your thighs
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   your hamstrings
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.980]   and up to your waist
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.980]   now
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.980]   with your entire lower body illuminated
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.980]   inside the beam of light
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.980]   from that spotlight
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.980]   inhale deeply through your nose
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   or through your mouth
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   and then exhale completely
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   through thinly pursed lips
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.980]   until your lungs are empty
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:55.980]   repeat that twice more
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.980]   and each time as you exhale
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.980]   imagine your lower body
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.980]   sinking down
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.980]   about a centimeter
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.980]   into whatever surface
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.980]   the surface
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.980]   you happen to be in contact with
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.980]   now
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   now continue by breathing normally
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.980]   inhale deeply
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.980]   and as you exhale
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.980]   imagine your body sinking
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.980]   another centimeter
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.980]   into the surface
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.980]   you are lying
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.980]   or sitting down on
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.980]   or sitting down on
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.980]   as you inhale
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   remember to have your belly expand
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.980]   ever so slightly
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.980]   and as you exhale
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.980]   your stomach will fall
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.980]   ever so slightly
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:06.980]   ever so slightly
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   as you breathe in this manner
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.980]   continue to imagine
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980]   the spotlight
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.980]   illuminating
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.980]   your entire body
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.980]   as you inhale
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.980]   you can imagine that spotlight
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.980]   getting slightly brighter
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.980]   and as you exhale
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.980]   imagine the spotlight
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   getting slightly dimmer
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.980]   continue to inhale
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.980]   and to exhale
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:45.980]   while imagining your body
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.980]   sinking down
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:55.980]   now pay attention
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.980]   to the muscles of your face
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   and as you continue to breathe normally
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   try to relax the muscles of your face
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.980]   at first
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.980]   only slightly
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:17.980]   and then with each subsequent breath
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   relaxing the muscles of your forehead
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.980]   and face
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.980]   more
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.980]   and more
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:41.980]   and more
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   now regardless of the environment you're in
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.980]   try to listen to sounds
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.980]   within that environment
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   whatever happens to be surrounding you
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.980]   try to hear it
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:24.980]   . . .
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.980]   Perhaps you can only hear the sound of your own breathing.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.980]   Perhaps there are noises in the room.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:41.980]   Regardless of the sounds you hear, try to focus on them.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:18:06.980]   Now, you will breathe in the same manner you breathed before, with a deep inhale through your nose . . . .
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.980]   until your lungs are full . . .
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.980]   And then a slow, complete exhale . . .
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.980]   through slightly pursed lips . . .
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:30.980]   Let's repeat that again . . .
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.980]   Inhale through your nose . . . .
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.980]   until your lungs are full . . . .
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   and exhale . . . .
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.980]   slowly through your mouth . . . .
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:59.980]   with slightly pursed lips . . . .
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:09.980]   Now in your mind's eye, try to imagine your body again illuminated by a spotlight.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:22.980]   Imagine looking down at yourself and your entire body is illuminated by that spotlight.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:38.980]   Dim that spotlight in your mind by about 50%.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.980]   And as you do so, deliberately relax the muscles of your legs.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   And deliberately relax the muscles of your hands, sensing your palms, wrists, and fingers.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:18.980]   Continue to breathe normally.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   And in your mind's eye, dim the spotlight 50% further still.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:35.980]   So that the image of your body in your mind's eye is barely a silhouette.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:57.980]   Now in your mind's eye, make the spotlight brighter.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:10.980]   Try to see any portion of your body in your mind's eye.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:19.980]   Your hands, your arms, your torso, your feet.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:31.980]   No matter if you see one or all of these parts, try to see them as if you are staring down at yourself.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:48.980]   Now move the spotlight to your abdomen and focus your attention on whatever it is your abdomen is sensing.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:56.980]   As you inhale, your stomach should move out slightly.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.980]   And as you exhale, it should sink down.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:10.980]   Expand the spotlight to include your upper abdomen, your chest, your neck.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:20.980]   And now in your mind's eye, imagine that spotlight is expanding to include your arms as well.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.980]   Continue to breathe normally.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.980]   Continue to breathe properly.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   Now focus your perception on whatever surface your back happens to be in contact with.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.980]   A shirt.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.980]   A chair.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   A sofa.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.980]   Whatever surface it happens to be contacting.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.980]   Focus on that contact now.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:52.980]   Simply bring your attention and your perception to those points of contact.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:59.980]   And as you do so, inhale deeply again through your nose or through your mouth.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   And then as you exhale, imagine your back and your upper body sinking about a centimeter into whatever surface they happen to be in contact with.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.980]   Now move the spotlight to include your face, the top of your head, and the back of your head.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:30.980]   And as you continue to breathe normally, focus your perception on relaxing the muscles of your face.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:43.980]   And as you continue to breathe normally, see if you can extend the duration of your exhales ever so slightly.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:24:03.980]   And now in your mind's eye, expand the spotlight downward to include your neck, your chest, your arms, your abdomen, your waist, your legs, and down to your feet.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   Imagine yourself looking down at your own body, illuminated inside of the spotlight.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.980]   And in your mind's eye, deliberately dim that spotlight.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   Make the illumination less intense.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   Inhale deeply again through your nose or through your mouth.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.980]   And then exhale completely through thinly pursed lips.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   And as you do so, imagine your entire body sinking into the surface it's in contact with.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:58.980]   Now, while continuing to breathe normally, move your toes ever so slightly.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.980]   In doing so, you'll notice that you are in control of your nervous system.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.980]   Meaning, you direct your perceptions and your actions.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:20.980]   Move your ankles and bend your knees just the slightest bit.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.980]   You can move your upper body from side to side.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.980]   Your head from side to side.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.980]   Or even nod just slightly.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   Just slightly.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   Now move your hands.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   Lift your arms just a tiny bit.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.980]   Then set them down again.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:48.980]   And now, whenever you are ready, slowly open your eyes.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:57.980]   And as you do so, you'll notice that normally, your nervous system is bombarded with sensory information.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.980]   Mostly visual information.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:06.980]   Which you have eliminated during this non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.980]   As you have now experienced, you are in control of your perceptions.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.980]   Controlling your perceptions is simply directing your attention to specific sensations.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.980]   And you control which sensations you perceive.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:30.980]   By directing your attentional spotlight to whatever part or parts of your body that you choose.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.980]   This reflects the remarkable power of the human brain.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.980]   You can direct your actions.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.980]   Your perceptions.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980]   And you can do so in order to bring about deep relaxation.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:54.980]   You can also do that to achieve heightened states of alertness.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.980]   Or attention to any sensation outside of you.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.980]   Or within you.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.980]   Non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.980]   Such as this one.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   Can help you restore your sense of mental and physical vigor.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:19.980]   Can partially offset the effects of not getting enough sleep.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.980]   And can also help you get better at falling and staying asleep.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.980]   It can be done any time of day or night.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.980]   When you feel you need a mental and/or physical reset.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:42.980]   Thank you for joining me for this non-sleep deep rest protocol.
