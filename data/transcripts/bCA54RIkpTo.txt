[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   - So I've learned more in these maths
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   than I have in all my years.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.320]   I'm a nerd, I got a PhD.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.080]   I learned more about life, about the mind,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.680]   in these maths than I have in all the years of school.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.720]   And I think two things,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.280]   two of the biggest things I took away is
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.400]   the humbling reality that I'm not special.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.120]   And if you wanna be good at anything,
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.820]   you have to work really hard.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.800]   And if you wanna be the best in the world at something,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.360]   like I do, I wanna build robots
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.200]   better than anybody else in the world.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   Or whether that's knitting or yodeling, anything.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.000]   You have to work, but you have to work harder
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.020]   than anyone else in the world.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.260]   And the second lesson I learned,
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.120]   I used to compete a lot, I used to lose a lot,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.840]   and I used to hurt to lose.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.320]   And I remember, I don't know if Phil remembers
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.080]   this conversation, but I think at Lake Blue Belt,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560]   I was going to a big competition,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.760]   and I said, you know, I don't know how I'm gonna win.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.960]   It's like 50 people division.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.840]   And he said, well, give everything you can to win.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.880]   But whether you win or lose,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.200]   you're still gonna have a home here.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.400]   I'm still gonna love you.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.540]   So the two things I'd like to say thank you for
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.520]   is the pain and the love.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.360]   (audience laughing)
