[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.880]   - Rob Smith joins us again.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.100]   Rob is a theologian who lectures in systematic theology
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.820]   and ethics at Sydney Missionary and Bible College
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.500]   in Australia.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.740]   Rob, I have a lot of questions for you.
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.940]   Today I wanna talk technology first.
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.080]   It seems that earlier transgender discussion
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.860]   of maybe 30 years ago seemed especially to center
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.580]   on things like cross-dressing and external behaviors.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.140]   With the rise of medical technology
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.220]   and the new possibilities for how our bodies
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.380]   can be physically rearranged,
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.220]   to what degree does technological advance
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.940]   drive the new possibilities and the new expectations
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.380]   of transgender changes within the body?
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.380]   - Yes, well, I think the answer is in a major way.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500]   It's the old thing of technology leading the way
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.220]   and morality having to catch up,
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.500]   which is really the wrong way of doing things.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.540]   We often are asking, can we do this before we ask,
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540]   should we do this?
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.480]   And so things get back to front.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.040]   Again, just in terms of the history
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.580]   of sex reassignment surgery,
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.220]   I mean, there's about a century of attempts
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.780]   that have gone on here.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.300]   And you're right, it's really in the last few decades
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.740]   that I think it's, I guess, become more possible
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.940]   and more successful.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.820]   So all the issues, however, still go on.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.500]   I mean, there's cross-dressing who have no desire
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.480]   to even engage in cross-hormone therapy,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.020]   let alone sex reassignment surgery.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.500]   And again, for some people with gender dysphoria,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.460]   that's one of the ways they try to manage
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.780]   or partially resolve the distress
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.060]   is through, whether it's cross-dressing
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.740]   or simply some kind of gender bending.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.020]   And so you get a whole range.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.220]   I was watching some YouTube clips just a week or so ago
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.220]   of a number of people, a number of women
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.380]   who began on a sort of cross-hormone therapy,
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980]   taking testosterone injections and so on,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.980]   and then decided to stop and to go back.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.100]   And so you get people who begin down the path
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.940]   and then retreat.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.900]   And well, obviously in my view, a very good thing
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.820]   when they do that, if they've resolved their questions
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.860]   in the process.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.480]   But I guess what's happening now more and more
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.540]   is that sex reassignment surgery is becoming available
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.740]   and affordable, and more and more doctors
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.500]   becoming able to deliver it.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.860]   Although perhaps not enough to meet demand.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.820]   I was reading an article just the other day from the UK
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.580]   where a urologist was complaining
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.940]   that not enough of his colleagues
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.180]   knew how to create a vagina.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.460]   And so he was being inundated with requests
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.660]   for reconstructive surgery for men
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.320]   who wanted to transition into women.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.220]   So yeah, I guess that's just where we are.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.340]   All these medical advances, medical possibilities,
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.620]   surgical developments and so on going on.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.860]   But I guess the question in back of all of that is,
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.160]   should we be doing this?
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.060]   Is this really an appropriate form of treatment
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.700]   for what is at heart a psychological condition?
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.620]   - Yeah, and as we mentioned earlier,
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.900]   I mean it raises the question over the purpose
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.780]   of medicine itself.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.580]   So the goal of medicine is to fix an unhealthy body.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.660]   So how much does gender reassignment put medicine
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.900]   into a tricky business of trying to fix a healthy body?
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.100]   - Well exactly, yeah.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.700]   There's nothing wrong with the body.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.500]   Again, unless we're dealing with a condition,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.860]   an intersex condition where there is again some ambiguity
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.940]   and some need to resolve that ambiguity,
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.220]   which sometimes isn't.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.100]   But again, if the body is straightforward and intact,
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.740]   then it really is I think going in the opposite direction
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.660]   to the Hippocratic principle of do no harm.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.500]   You're now perhaps mutilating a perfectly healthy body
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.740]   to try and address a psychological problem.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.180]   Now some would say, well that's the best option open.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.500]   That's the only option open.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.460]   Or unless we go this path,
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.380]   this person may take their own life.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.660]   And perhaps if I'm just gonna pause on that point
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.500]   for a moment.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.700]   - Yeah, certainly.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.420]   - This is one of the things I think is driving
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.660]   the transgender revolution is what many call
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.580]   the suicide narrative.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.460]   That unless we affirm and enable,
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.620]   we're gonna drive people into suicide.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.620]   Now that's a heavy threat to hang over anyone's head,
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.500]   isn't it?
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.340]   - Yeah.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.460]   - That's enough to make most people step out of the way.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.460]   Now of course the reality is the instance of suicide
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.180]   or attempted suicide post transition
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.340]   is as high as it is pre transition.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.340]   So there's no guarantee at all that allowing
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.500]   or encouraging somebody to try and transition
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.020]   is going to preserve their life in the longer term.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.140]   And this is one of the reasons why Johns Hopkins University
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.620]   have ceased to do sex reassignment surgery.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.100]   They just saw the outcomes were, didn't justify it.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.740]   So again, there's a lot of misinformation
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.060]   and things that people have to wade through
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.220]   to get a clearer view.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.740]   But obviously we want to know the best way to help people.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.540]   And again, we ought to be filled with compassion
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.540]   for the genuine sufferer, a person with gender dysphoria
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.380]   who finds it almost intolerable to step out the front door
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.980]   and to look in a mirror.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.780]   And that does beg the question, how do we help them?
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.060]   But I don't believe that encouraging or enabling them
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.660]   to try and become something that in the end
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.300]   they can't actually become is the way to do it.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.980]   If there's depression, if there's anxiety,
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.500]   if there's a range of other things going on,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   let's try and deal with those first.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.980]   Let's try and provide the help that's necessary
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.980]   for this person to function.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.780]   But again, it's not simple.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.380]   And it'd be lovely to have silver bullets
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.740]   and easy answers and quick fixes.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.580]   It's just not like that.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.420]   - No, it is certainly not.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.260]   Thank you, Rob.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.980]   And for more on the statistics here,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.640]   see the op-ed by the former psychiatrist in chief
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.420]   at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Paul McHugh.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.860]   He wrote a Wall Street Journal piece
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.620]   titled "Transgender Surgery Isn't the Solution."
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.940]   It's a fascinating read.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.160]   You can find it online.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.060]   And we have addressed suicide on the podcast in the past.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.700]   See episode number 352,
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.340]   which is titled "Suicide and Salvation."
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.180]   Heavy.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.980]   Well, the week is coming to an end
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.540]   and so is our time with Rob.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.780]   And we return tomorrow to look at the hopes
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.860]   and the tensions and the roadblocks faced
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.400]   by those who are pursuing transgender transitions.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.200]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.460]   with guest Rob Smith from Sydney, Australia.
