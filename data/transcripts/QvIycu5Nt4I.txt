[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   saliva is essentially continually buffering the pH in your mouth.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.960]   The gut can buffer itself a lot easier because it's inside.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.700]   But when you're right in front of the outside world and your mouth is open for six, seven,
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.440]   eight hours at night, and saliva flow rate drops off anyway at night, even if your mouth
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.800]   is closed, a saliva gland shut down if you're in deep sleep, that's part of the restorative
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.400]   process.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.280]   And again, saliva isn't really needed.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.380]   Your tongue is not moving if you're in REM sleep.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.980]   There's not much washing and cleaning going on.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.960]   Think of a spin washer, a clothes washer with the impeller, and it's not going to clean the
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.720]   dirt and do what it's supposed to do if it's not spinning and moving and if there isn't
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.660]   enough water in there.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.340]   Essentially what it does is it allows the bad bugs to proliferate and do more damage.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.600]   It also drops the pH in the mouth so that you're demineralizing quicker than you are remineralizing.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.800]   Again, you need a optimal pH for that fixing, that equilibrium to work.
