[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Alright, our next question is from Vinny.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Vinny asks, "How should I adjust my approach to hourly billing
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   after becoming many-fold more efficient after instituting deep work?"
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   He elaborates, "Ideally, freelance projects would be either flat-fee based
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   or an appropriate rate per hour."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   He says, "I don't always, however, have this ideal situation.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Take this contrived example. I'm billing $100 an hour with an existing client,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   working six hours a day for $600.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   After becoming a proficient deep worker, I can get the same amount of work done in two hours.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Explaining this to an existing client would be tough.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Would it be reasonable to continue billing for six hours after working two
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   hours in an environment where rates can't be raised and clients won't pay by value?"
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Well, Vinny, you can't bill for hours that you didn't actually work.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   That's not going to be the solution.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   The two things you said that can't happen are ultimately the two things you need to happen.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   So you may need different clients.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   You may need a different structure to your work.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   The traditional way you deal with getting better at your work is you raise your rates or you work less.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   That is the economic levers you have.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   So if you become a more proficient deep worker, it's not just you get work done quicker.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You're probably doing it at a higher level of quality.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So the standard approach there is keep raising the rates you charge.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And now for less and less work, you're making the same amount of money.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Or you switch to the value-based billing that you talked about here, and you can double or triple the amount of clients that you're servicing in the same amount of time.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Those are the two options you have.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Those are the two classic options as you get better at a freelancer.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'm going to point you towards a book that I talk about a lot on this show, Company of One by Paul Jarvis.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   He really gets into this.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   He really gets into if you have a business that's basically just you.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And you're not really looking to grow this into some sort of massive concern with tons of employees that you'll one day sell for tens of millions of dollars.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   What's the right thing to do?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And he really gets into exactly these issues.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   How do you get more from your time?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   How do you get paid more for your time?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   How do you figure out that balance of how much you want to work and don't want to work?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   How do you figure out should I take my increasing skill and efficiency to work less hours?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Or should I take my increasing skill and efficiency to make more money for the hours I work?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   He really gets into those questions.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's the questions you should be asking now.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   My only advice here is don't be so quick to say, "I can't raise my rates.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I can't switch to a value-based approach."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I think the reality here is that you have an existing client that's a pain and doesn't like those type of things.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Think beyond that client.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Think about the future clients you could sell.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Think about the future services you could sell.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Think about just being super clear.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   This is how I work.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   This is how I do it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Don't take it or leave it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'll give you one more book that gets into that latter bit as long as we're talking books.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Jenny Blake has a new book coming out called "Free Time."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Actually, I interviewed Jenny Blake.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   There's going to be an interview with her on this podcast soon.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   In that conversation, which is coming out soon, and in her book, which is available now for preorder but comes out in the winter,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   she also gets into how she had to radically change her agreement with her clients.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Say, "I don't do this anymore, and this is how it works."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Very scary.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You assume that everyone's going to run away and that you're going to be homeless within six or seven days.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Doesn't usually happen.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   If you know what you're doing, if you know what you're about, if you're delivering good work, you have more leverage.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We've got to get your confidence up to apply this leverage.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So look at those two books and think, "How can I actually take advantage of my increased efficiency and effectiveness?"
