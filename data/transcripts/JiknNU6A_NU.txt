[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The Legacy Standard Bible, a very literal translation of the original text, is helpful
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   because for a young believer, an older believer, or even a seasoned scholar, it gives you the
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.960]   intended meaning of the original language. The power is in the words, and understanding the words
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.040]   is what gives you God's word. In other words, if you don't understand what God meant to say
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.520]   originally, you're not going to be able to really hear from God. And so for any Christian,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.400]   you want to hear from God. And the more we're able to understand what he meant to say,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.760]   whether through Paul or Peter or John or Moses or David, that's really what you want to unpack.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320]   And once you understand that, that's the truth that sets you to a different place of
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.040]   sanctification as you know God more.
