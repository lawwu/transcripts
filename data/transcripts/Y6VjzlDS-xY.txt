[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   that chapter that we read at the beginning, namely the first chapter in Paul's first epistle
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.760]   to Timothy, in the fifteenth verse.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.560]   The fifteenth verse in the first chapter of Paul's first epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:30.400]   This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.920]   world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.080]   Now I've got three main reasons for calling your attention to this great word.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.200]   The first is this.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.680]   Here we find ourselves on the first Sunday night of a new year, and I trust that the
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.280]   fact that it is the first Sunday night of a new year makes us all think, I hope it has
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.400]   made us think during the week that has just finished, of this whole question of life and
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:18.000]   of living, the whole purpose and object of it all, its cost and especially its future,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.440]   and our future.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.280]   Now I'm sure that we have been indulging in such thoughts, and if we have, there are two
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.000]   great needs that we all must have been aware of.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.520]   It seems to me that to any person who thinks at all at the present time, and who does look
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.680]   out upon the world as it is in all its terrible and terrifying confusion, there are two things
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.280]   surely that any thinking person must desire above everything else.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.760]   The first is this, some certain sure word.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.080]   We are living in a world which is full of words, but what we all need above everything
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   else is something in which we can confide, something which we can trust, something of
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   which we can be absolutely sure.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.480]   The world, as I say, is full of vices, full of words, never more so.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.960]   It's always been a place of much speaking, but it's never spoken as much as it speaks
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   today.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.040]   Look at it doing it in the newspapers, the television.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.560]   The means of communication have been so multiplied, and the result is that the modern man finds
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.640]   himself literally surrounded by a fable of vices, all hurling themselves at him, speaking
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.160]   to him, suggesting this and that to him.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.080]   But surely we are all agreed in saying this, that all these words seem to be of very little
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   value to us.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.160]   We have heard them so often, the world goes on repeating them.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   But what's come of them?
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   What's happened?
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   Have they been fulfilled?
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760]   Have they been verified?
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.920]   All the promises, what's become of them?
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.840]   What of all the good advice we've been given?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.000]   What of all the schemes that have been put before us?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.640]   What about all the quick patent solutions that have been offered to us?
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.400]   They've all come to nothing.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.960]   And I believe that the world tonight is getting very tired of listening to all these words
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.120]   and all these vices.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.560]   And people are beginning to say, "Oh, is there nothing sure?
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   Is there nothing reliable?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   Is there nothing certain?
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.800]   Is there no word anywhere that can come to us and give us a little confidence and give
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.360]   us some assurance?"
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.640]   Well now, it's because this verse that we're looking at answers that question, as you see,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.520]   that I call your attention to it.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.960]   This, says the Apostle, is a faithful saying.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.520]   This is a reliable saying, and therefore worthy of all acceptation.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.800]   You can receive it with absolute confidence.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.640]   You can rely upon it, you can commit yourself and your life and all you have and all you
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.400]   are and the whole of your future utterly and absolutely to this.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.880]   It is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.320]   You need have no reservations.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.560]   You need no qualifications.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.080]   Take it as it is.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.920]   Take it absolutely.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.440]   Commit yourself completely and entirely to it.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.360]   That's one reason for considering it.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   But says somebody, "How can I know that?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.640]   Isn't just this not one of these other words that you've already described to us and of
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.920]   which we're all, we agree, so utterly tired?"
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.960]   Well now, the Apostle says that there is something unique about this.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.000]   I mustn't take too much time in answering that particular difficulty tonight, otherwise
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.920]   we shall do nothing else, and I am rather concerned to give you the content of this
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.560]   message.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.120]   But I must say this in passing, that there is abundant evidence for saying that this
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.640]   is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   What is the basis?
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   What's the evidence?
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.840]   Well, the main evidence, of course, is to be found in the facts, which I am going to
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.560]   put before you.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.600]   The facts concerning this person, Christ Jesus.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.480]   Now you notice I say "facts."
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.640]   I'm not saying theories, I'm not saying teaching.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.720]   I'm saying facts.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.080]   The facts concerning him.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   There is the fundamental basis for our assurance that this is a reliable word.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.720]   But not only, of course, the facts concerning him.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.120]   But in addition to that, these further facts, the facts concerning this Apostle Paul himself.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.840]   That's the very thing he's dealing with here.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.920]   He's writing to Timothy, who was rather a frightened, nervous kind of individual.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.160]   Timothy, he says, "You need have no doubt about these things at all.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.880]   This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation."
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.120]   Then he says, "If you have no other reason for believing that, let this be enough for
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   you.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   Look at me.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.800]   Look what's happened to me."
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.400]   There is no adequate explanation of what happened to that man known as Saul of Tarsus, whom
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   we know better as the Apostle Paul.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.080]   There is no adequate explanation of what happened to that man save the facts, which are recorded
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   here in this verse.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.400]   That's why he's so sure about it.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   That's why he says it's reliable.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.920]   It's a faithful saying.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   You can bank your all upon it.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.440]   Not only that, the same facts are to be found in the lives of the other apostles, the people,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.160]   these other men who wrote these New Testament epistles and were responsible for the four
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   Gospels.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.720]   There are further facts which show the reliability of this message.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.760]   In other words, Christianity is a phenomenon in history.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.720]   And that is the proof of the solidity of this and of its reliability.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.640]   You've got the whole fact of the foundation of the Christian Church.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.600]   With all the attendant circumstances, there would never have been a Christian Church were
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.800]   it not for the fact of the resurrection.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.600]   The Bible makes that perfectly clear.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.000]   When these disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, when they saw him dying on that cross and
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.400]   buried in a grave, they lost hope.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.160]   They were completely hopeless.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.880]   And there would never have been a Church were it not that he literally did rise from the
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.200]   dead.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.320]   And that gave being and life and power to the Church.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:08.000]   So there is just a kind of outline, very hurriedly for you, of the reliability of this statement
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   and the subsequent history of the Christian Church manifests and proves and demonstrates
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.080]   precisely the same point.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   The Christian Church would have made shipwreck of herself almost a thousand times during
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.800]   the last two thousand years were it not for the fact that she is the Church of God and
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.200]   that what we are looking at tonight is fact, reliable fact.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.680]   If the Church were not the Church of God, she would have destroyed herself so many times
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.040]   and she would have done so in this present century.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.920]   She is still here and the message is still being proclaimed for one reason only, that
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.320]   she is the Church of God and not the mere Church of men.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.600]   Very well, there is the first thing, a certain world.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.160]   Did you come into this service because you are perplexed, because you are uncertain,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.320]   because you are looking for some leading, some light, some knowledge, some understanding
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.360]   of life and the world and even yourself?
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.200]   Here it is, my friend.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.280]   Here is an authoritative world.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.720]   In other words, I am just expanding the Scripture.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   I do not stand here to give my views as to what should happen in 1962.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.760]   I am not here to give advice to the government.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.200]   I am not here to give advice to labor or to capital.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.280]   I am not here to solve all the problems of society.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.760]   That would just be my thinking and who am I any more than you.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.320]   I am not here to do this.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.640]   I am here to expound this, which claims to be the Word of God.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.160]   The Apostle Paul never said it was his Word.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.400]   He said it was given to him, committed to him.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.760]   He had received it of the Lord.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.480]   That is the claim.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:55.080]   We claim that this is a message from God himself to men, not a mere word from man to man and
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.200]   one man's opinion over against another, the Word of God.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.400]   Very well, there is one reason.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.840]   But a second reason.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:15.040]   Surely any thinking person again is anxious for some kind of change, change out of the
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.040]   hopelessness.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:29.280]   Isn't this something that is true of the individual and of larger masses of people?
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.240]   Haven't you felt that you'd like to be different?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.520]   Haven't you felt the need of some deliverance in your life?
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.720]   Haven't you felt that you'd like to live a new kind of life?
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.200]   Well, this is a fact.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   This is true of all thinking men.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.920]   Men are always proposing to be better, trying to be better.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   New year, new year's resolutions.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   He's got to turn over a new page.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   He's dissatisfied with his life.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.400]   There's an element of failure there.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.240]   He's gone down to the same thing and he's ashamed as he looks back.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.680]   And the whole question is this.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.360]   Isn't there a new, different life possible?
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.520]   Isn't there some change possible?
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.360]   Hope springs eternal in the human breast.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.920]   Men's always proposing to be better and always trying to be better by means of his resolutions
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.200]   and endeavors and all these things.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.240]   Yes, but the question again is what happens to all these hopes?
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.700]   What happens to all these resolutions?
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.240]   What happens to our pledges?
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.760]   What happens to our solemn vows?
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.000]   Haven't we all got to admit that it's but the same sorry tale once more?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.840]   Our vows are made only to be broken.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.280]   We don't want to break them, but we do break them.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.440]   And all our resolutions and resolves come to nothing.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.480]   We've done it so often.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   And men begins to feel a sense of despair.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.760]   And he cries out and he asks, "Is there no hope?
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.100]   Isn't there another kind of life possible?
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.240]   Isn't there some deliverance?"
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.440]   Well the apostle answers that in this same verse.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.760]   He says, "Look here, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:24.840]   That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief."
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.840]   What does he mean?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.040]   Well, he's telling us his own story.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   You've listened to it.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.520]   He says, "And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me for that he counted me
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.960]   faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   injurious.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.280]   That I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.920]   You see, he's amazed at the thing that's happened to him.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.520]   Here is a man who underwent a complete revolution.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.680]   Here he was, a bitter, persecuting, blasphemous enemy of Christ and of the Church.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:08.120]   And yet here he is writing to Timothy as its leading proponent, its greatest preacher,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.120]   its unmatched teacher and apostle.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.560]   Here it is, you see, from being Saul of Tarsus he's become the mighty apostle Paul.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.840]   There was never such a change.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.160]   It's a complete change.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   It's an utter revolution.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.000]   "Very well," says Paul, "listen, this is how it happened.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.600]   This is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception, that Christ Jesus came into the
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.080]   world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief."
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.040]   My dear friend, have you come in tonight because you've been beginning to feel hopeless about
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   yourself?
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.840]   Have you been on the point of saying, "I might as well give up the fight.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   I can't do it.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   I'm defeated.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   I'm constantly defeated.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   I'm always going down.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.320]   I can't put myself right.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.720]   I've tried the philosophies.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.760]   I've tried the moral schemes.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.200]   They all come to nothing.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   Is there no hope?"
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   There is.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.840]   Paul says, "I'm a pattern and an example.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.040]   That's what I am," he says.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:15.120]   "Christ Jesus showed his mercy in me first for a pattern to them which should hereafter
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.640]   believe on him to life everlasting."
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:27.040]   It is possible for you, my friend, to have an entirely new life, to make a completely
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   new start, a new beginning.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:36.000]   Now, the fact that it's 1962 and no longer '61 doesn't make any difference, does it?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.960]   We try to persuade ourselves it does, but it doesn't.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.560]   The change of the year doesn't change a man's nature.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.220]   The new calendar doesn't make any difference to your circumstances.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.600]   It leaves you exactly where you were.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.920]   There's only one thing, one thing alone in the whole universe tonight that really offers
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   a new beginning.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.160]   It is what is told us in this faithful saying.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.480]   That's my second reason for calling your attention to it.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.240]   I have a third, and this is a purely personal one.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   I always like to start a new year in the right way, and I always like to make it very clear
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.520]   as to what I'm proposing to do.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.080]   I come into this pulpit Sunday by Sunday to do one thing only, and that is to declare
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.680]   in some shape or form this faithful saying which is worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:42.520]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.040]   God forbid that I should ever abuse this pulpit in talking about anything or anybody apart
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.480]   from Christ Jesus, who came into this world.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.720]   I start the year with him.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.440]   If it be God's will, I shall end it with him.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.800]   There is nothing else that is worthy of my endeavor and of my effort.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.600]   Christ Jesus, the Lord.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   Very well.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   Now then, there are our reasons.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.320]   Forget that last one.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.760]   Remember the other two.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:26.960]   A certain word, an assured word, a reliable word, a word of hope, the possibility of a
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   new life.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   How is it possible?
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:41.000]   Well, he tells us here, it is only possible as we believe and give a thorough acceptation
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.560]   to this statement.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   What is it?
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   Well, here it is.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.360]   Here is the gospel in a nutshell, and I am just going to put it before you.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.240]   The first word is Christ Jesus.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.800]   You always start with him.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.480]   There is no gospel apart from him.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.600]   Christianity, as has often been pointed out, is Christ.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.880]   See, it isn't just a teaching, just a philosophy.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.320]   It's the person.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   It's all about a person.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   Gospel, they are nothing but an account of a person, an individual who has lived in this
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   world.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   Christ Jesus.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:28.360]   It's all, then, I say, about him, the facts concerning him.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:34.280]   Now, oh, people are confused about this.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.320]   But here we are looking at the greatest and the most crucial event in the whole of human
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   history.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:45.080]   We are all very concerned about history at the present time, and rightly so.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.400]   We are in an age of revolution.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.420]   We are in an age of change.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.120]   We may be in the last age.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.760]   There are many people who think we are, not only Christians, but others, as you know,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   outside.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   Very well.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.840]   Never should the world have been more interested in history than just at this moment.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.620]   The great question is, what's happening?
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.620]   What is history?
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   Where are we going?
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.520]   Where are we heading?
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   What is the future?
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.000]   Now, what have we got to help us here?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.720]   Does the past history help us?
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.040]   I've just been reading a book this week which bears a most significant title, "The
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.400]   Poverty of Historicism," which more or less means this, that the history of the past
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.800]   doesn't help us today, because we are not mere gadgets.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.400]   We are not mere pieces of mechanism.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   There is this imponderable which is called human nature, so that though you may be an
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.280]   expert on past history, it doesn't help you to tell about the future.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.560]   Very well, there's only one clear guidance about history, and it's here, and it's
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.240]   about this person.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.280]   I've reminded you already that we are in 1962.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.400]   But why is it called 1962?
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.680]   Why isn't it called something else?
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.320]   Why does everybody talk about 1962?
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.560]   Why do people who are not Christians talk about 1962?
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.120]   They shouldn't do so, if they were really logical and consistent.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:10.800]   Well, the answer is, of course, that 1962 comes into being for one reason only, that
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.080]   the whole of history revolves around this person, Christ Jesus.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.280]   He is the center of history.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.040]   He has divided history.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.600]   History is divided into B.C.A.D.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.200]   The time before Christ Jesus came into the world, the time subsequent to Christ Jesus
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.280]   coming into the world, the year of the Lord, 1962.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.160]   The whole of human history, you see, has been determined by this person.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.040]   Here is the crucial event of all history, and the world pays tribute to the reliability
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.760]   of this message by talking about 1962.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.600]   Had you ever realized that by using this very terminology, you are agreeing with Paul that
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.920]   it is a faithful saying, that Christ Jesus came into the world?
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.760]   It is a fact.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   And I am here to say this in addition, and this is much more important, that this is
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:18.840]   not only in actual practice the crucial turning point of all history, the dividing point,
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.920]   the watershed, if you like, of all history.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.520]   It is only in the light of this fact that you really can understand history, and understand
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.680]   the world tonight, and understand the future.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:41.520]   So that what we say is this, that as we start 1962, the thing to do is not to try to look
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.840]   into the future, not to borrow a telescope, not to get some kind of super-jodrell bank
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.080]   which will enable us to see to some tremendous distance in the future.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.440]   That's not the way to understand history, my friend.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.600]   If you want to understand history, turn back.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.120]   Yes, I say that without any apology.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.200]   In a world that is always looking forward, hoping for some advance and development, I
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.680]   say that's the fatal error.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.480]   There's only one way to understand the future, it's to look back to the past, and to look
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.960]   back to this person, Christ Jesus.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:22.600]   He and he alone enables us to understand the whole of life, and the whole of history.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.560]   So let's not look to some uncertain future.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:33.040]   Let's not attempt our prognostications, let's not indulge in vain hopes, but let's look
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.520]   at him.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   And what do we find?
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.680]   Well, what we find is this.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:47.480]   We find a person standing out in history who's called Jesus, Christ Jesus.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.360]   In other words, at a given point in time, a babe was born in a little place called Bethlehem,
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.080]   and they called his name Jesus.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.240]   And then you read the story about him in the Gospels.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.520]   These men began to teach at the age of 30, and had that extraordinary ministry for three
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.400]   years, working miracles, making pronouncements such as men had never heard, leading Roman
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.640]   soldiers to say, "Never man spake like this man."
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.880]   And then you remember, taken and condemned and crucified, dead and buried in a grave.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.360]   And then rose again and manifested himself, as I've reminded you, to these apostles, and
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.680]   500 other chosen witnesses, and then in the presence of his disciples ascended into heaven.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   Now, here's the whole question.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   Who's this?
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   Christ Jesus.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   Well, he's a man, Jesus.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:42.280]   Born as a babe, grew up as a boy, worked as a carpenter.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   Obviously a man.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   Quite right.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   Jesus.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.760]   Jesus of Nazareth, son of Mary, known also as the son of Joseph.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.640]   A man called Jesus.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   Very well.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.960]   Do we stop at that?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:05.080]   If we do, we are just confronted by another human teacher, whom you may put, if you like,
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:12.720]   into the category of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, some of the great prophets of the Old Testament,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.280]   some of the great originators of the great world religions.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.280]   They were all men.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.040]   They never claimed to be anything else.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.960]   They were just men who taught.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   Is he just one of them?
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.400]   Well, now, you see, the apostle makes it impossible for us to say that.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.240]   Christ Jesus.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.200]   And Christ means saviour, deliverer, messiah.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.080]   Not only that, he tells us that this is someone who has come into the world.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.720]   Now, he doesn't say, you see, that Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   That is a fact.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   He was born in Bethlehem.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   Why doesn't he put it like that?
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.640]   Well, you see, he doesn't put it like that because he wants to bring out this great and
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:24:03.240]   all-important point, that Jesus of Nazareth is not only a man, he has come into the world.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.520]   He doesn't start there.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.240]   He was before.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.840]   He was in another world.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.000]   He was in eternity, as John puts it in his Gospel, "In the beginning was the Word, and
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.600]   the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.720]   There never was a time when he wasn't.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.320]   He and the Father are co-equal and co-eternal.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.520]   We've been reminding ourselves about that over Christmas.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.760]   Well, now, this is how he puts it.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.360]   This blessed person, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity, has come out of
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   eternity into time.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.040]   Here's the event.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.480]   Here is, I say, the thing that constitutes the watershed of all history, that Christ
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.680]   Jesus came into the world.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.040]   Now, can't you see that this is the most astounding thing that has ever happened in
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   history?
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.280]   It's the whole basis of this message.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   It's all about this person.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.960]   If we are not right about him, there will be no value in his teaching to us.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.640]   In other words, it comes to this, that the faithful saying which is worthy of all acceptation
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:17.520]   is that at a given point in time, God, the Father, the Eternal God, sent into this world
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:25.640]   of men and women, into our world, his only begotten Beloved Son.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.800]   There in Bethlehem that greatest of miracles took place.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.960]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, the Incarnation.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.320]   Now, you see, at once you've got an entirely new view.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.920]   We are familiar with history.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   We have read about the great statesmen, the great kings, the great philosopher kings,
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.960]   the great philosophers, the seers, the religious leaders.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.880]   They've all been trying to solve the problem.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   They've written their books.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   They've given their teaching.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.400]   It all comes to nothing.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   It's of no value.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.360]   Here is something that is entirely different.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.720]   God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.400]   Out of eternity, out of the bosom of God, the Son of God has come and has entered into
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.520]   life, has taken on to him human nature, has lived as a man in this world.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.520]   Christ Jesus came into the world.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.360]   My dear friends, can't you see that the whole world as it is tonight, because it doesn't
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.320]   believe this, it doesn't realize its meaning, it doesn't know its significance, all of
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.880]   it is all honor to your great captains, your great kings, your great philosophers.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.160]   But none of them has been able to do what is necessary for the world.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.760]   But here God has sent his only Son into the world.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   In your perplexity, says Paul, in your uncertainty, in your need for a word, in your need for
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.800]   deliverance, listen.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.000]   God has done something about the world.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   God has done something about you that can make all the difference to you.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.480]   Stop listening to men.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.440]   Begin to listen to the Word of God, this faithful saying that is worthy of all acceptation.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:14.880]   The eternal Son of God has entered into time, has been in this world, has walked up and
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.520]   down this world as it were, has lived, has died in it, and has gone back out of it to
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   the glory out of which he came.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.600]   There is the beginning of it all.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.560]   There is the basis of the message.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.640]   But wait a minute.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.800]   Why did he come into the world?
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.080]   That is the question, isn't it?
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.520]   Is this just a phenomenon?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.600]   Is this just a spectacle as such?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.400]   If God did send his only Son into the world, if the Son did leave the eternal bosom and
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.280]   dwell here as a man for those thirty-three years, why did he do it?
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.840]   Now then, here it becomes very practical.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.600]   You notice how the apostle puts it.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:05.200]   He says Christ Jesus came into the world in order to put the world right, in order to
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:11.440]   reform the world, in order to introduce legislation that would abolish all the difficulties and
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.960]   the problems of the world.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.240]   Christ Jesus came into the world to put an end to war, to solve all industrial problems,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.400]   to introduce a spirit of brotherhood, and we would all live happily ever afterwards.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.280]   No, no.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:31.960]   There is not a single word in the whole of the Bible which says that Christ came to do
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.000]   anything to the world as such.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.720]   That is not what he came to do.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.400]   He came to do this.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.680]   He came to save sinners out of the world.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   Here is the message.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:51.120]   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.840]   That is the object of the Incarnation.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.480]   That is why he died on the cross.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.920]   That is why he did everything he did.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.320]   He came to save sinners, not to reform or improve the world, but to save us out of the
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.720]   world, to save sinners.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.720]   Now then, what does this mean?
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:12.440]   Oh, here are the things, you see, about which we must be absolutely certain.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.240]   Here is God's answer to our perplexity, to our uncertainty, to our need of hope and our
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   need of deliverance.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:24.120]   You have got to be clear about that person, then you have got to be clear about yourself.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   A sinner.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.360]   What is a sinner?
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.400]   If he has come into the world in order to save sinners, the most urgent thing for me
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.160]   to know is what a sinner is.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   Am I a sinner?
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.160]   Who is a sinner?
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   What is a sinner?
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:42.280]   Well, in this very chapter, the apostle has been giving us some description of what it
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.160]   means to be a sinner.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.280]   He says, "We know that the law is good if a man uses it lawfully, knowing this, that
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.840]   the law is not made for a righteous man, but for"—now here is the description of the
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:02.440]   sinner—"for the lawless, for the disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for unholy
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:10.080]   and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, murderers,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:18.240]   for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men-stealers, for liars,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.200]   for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine."
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.640]   Now, there is a part of the definition of what it means to be a sinner.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   What is a sinner?
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:35.160]   Well, a man is a sinner who disobeys and breaks all the laws of God.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.440]   God made man in his own image and he meant him to live a righteous life.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.800]   He gave him an original righteousness.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   What is sin?
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.480]   It is a departure from that.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.960]   It is a departure from the law of God.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.840]   There are many lists given here in this New Testament of what it means to be a sinner.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.400]   I have just read one of them to you.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.680]   Let me read you another one, which will put it still more clearly and still more explicitly
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.400]   for us in 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:07.080]   Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:13.040]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.000]   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.280]   All those are sinners.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.320]   And I could easily add to the list.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:30.560]   "Ah, very well," says somebody, "that is what you mean by a sinner."
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:36.040]   In that case, I am very happy to think and to say that I am not a sinner.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.280]   I have never done any of these things at all.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.640]   I have never got drunk.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.680]   I have never committed adultery.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.280]   I am not guilty of murder or any of the things, nor abuse with mankind and so on.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.600]   Thank God I am free.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   I am not a sinner.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.560]   Wait a minute, my dear friend.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   Listen to this man.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:59.680]   He says, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I, Paul the apostle,
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   am the chief."
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.080]   He is the chief of sinners.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.840]   So in my definition of a sinner, I have somehow or another got to include this apostle Paul.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.640]   Well, he was never a murderer.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   He never got drunk.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.280]   He never committed immorality.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.880]   He was not guilty of any one of those things that he has mentioned.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.740]   He was a highly moral man always.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.420]   He was a very religious man always.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:28.840]   He was a pharisee, a man who was trained in the law, a teacher of others.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.960]   He lived as he thought to serve God and to please Him, and he did so with all good conscience.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.760]   But he never did any of those things, and yet he says he is the chief of sinners.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.480]   Now then, what does this tell us?
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.360]   Oh, I will tell you what it tells us.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:52.520]   A sinner is a man who thinks that he is capable of pleasing God in and of himself.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.320]   And this is the characteristic of the chief kind of sinners, people who are much worse
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.400]   than the drunkards and the revilers and the adulterers, the kind of person as this man
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.680]   Sol of Tarsus was, who rarely believed that by being religious and living a good life,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.040]   they were satisfying God.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.280]   He was very pleased with himself.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.120]   He was self-righteous.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.960]   The world has many people like this tonight, and they, I would remind you, are the greatest
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.080]   enemies of the Christian truth and the Christian faith.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.520]   Our poor drunkard and prostitute is not an enemy to the Christian faith.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.880]   Nobody defends that.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.400]   I will tell you the kind of man who is the real enemy is the modern Pharisee, the modern
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.560]   Sol of Tarsus, the man who says airily that he still believes in practicing the Christian
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.880]   ethic, but has long since given up believing the Christian dogma.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.080]   And these are some of your very respectable people, names greatly honored.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.400]   You have listened to them on the television and on the wireless.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.840]   These great men who find that they, in their own strength and power, can carry out the
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   teaching of Christ.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.960]   They don't believe in his deity.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.400]   They don't believe in his atoning death, but they do like his Sermon on the Mount,
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.000]   and they are practicing this.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.760]   That's what makes a man the chief of sinners.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.200]   That was exactly the trouble with Sol of Tarsus.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.680]   He was thoroughly satisfied with his good, moral, religious life and living.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:21.760]   He believed that that put him right in the sight of God, and he was very satisfied and
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.800]   very pleased with himself.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.640]   He looks back and says, "That made me the chief of sinners."
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:31.240]   I can sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:39.600]   A sinner is a man who has never seen the need of Christ Jesus coming into the world.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.440]   A sinner is the type of man to whom it wouldn't make the slightest difference if it could
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.520]   be proved that Christ Jesus never had come into the world.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.240]   He's never seen any need of him.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.920]   He doesn't believe in him.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.720]   He rejects him.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.600]   He may be highly moral, as I say.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.320]   He may be a most excellent man, very benevolent, and all the rest of it.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:08.240]   But if he doesn't believe in this Christ Jesus, he's a most terrible sinner.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.580]   This man was.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.640]   He was a blasphemer, by which he means this.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.760]   When he was told that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, he said, "That's blasphemy."
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.000]   He was nothing but a man.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.160]   That's what he means by saying that he was a blasphemer.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.880]   He denied the deity of Christ.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   He denied his Godhood.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.680]   He said, "This is a carpenter.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.680]   This is just a fellow.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.680]   Who is he?
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.400]   He's not even trained as a Pharisee."
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.200]   He ridiculed him.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.600]   That's what makes a man the chief of sinners.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.120]   And he persecuted him.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.320]   He laughed at him.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.000]   He was an injurious person.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   He mocked at him.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.840]   He derided him, as the clever people are doing today.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.480]   That makes them Pharisees.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.560]   They think we are the Pharisees who come to church.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.840]   They are the Pharisees.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.120]   They don't see any need of church.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.660]   They don't see any need of Christ.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.760]   They don't see any need of grace or of mercy.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.200]   As they are, they're perfectly satisfied.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.380]   And they reject him.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.380]   And they see no need of him.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.360]   There is no greater sin than that.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.220]   This is infinitely worse than murder.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.520]   Infinitely worse.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520]   What is a sinner?
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.440]   Well, it's here in one phrase, in that thirteenth verse.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.880]   "I did it ignorantly," says Paul, "in unbelief."
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:21.320]   A sinner is a man who is in the grip of the devil to such an extent that he cannot believe
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   in Christ.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.320]   He's ignorant.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   The sinner tonight is the man who doesn't know that he is a sinner.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.560]   He doesn't know anything about his utter helplessness before God and his final hopelessness.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.840]   He's ignorant in unbelief.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.320]   And so he doesn't believe in Christ Jesus as the one who's come into the world to save
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   sinners.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.160]   Where are you, my friend?
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.080]   You are troubled about the problem of the world.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.240]   I ask you, wait for a moment and start with yourself.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.360]   Can't you see that the world is as it is because it's full of sinners?
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.960]   Some of them living in the gutters.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.160]   Others in their high respectability who think that they can make a perfect world by passing
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.280]   acts of parliament or by making protests.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.120]   Many of the people who are making the world as it is, they've got to realize that they
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.600]   are sinners.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.680]   Any man who doesn't see his utter absolute need of the Son of God coming into this world
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.760]   is the chief of sinners.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.920]   Very well.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.600]   Well now then, why does this person need to be saved if that's our definition of a sinner?
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.200]   He says Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Why is this necessary?
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.320]   What's he mean by this saving of sinners?
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.640]   Well, here it is.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:47.880]   A man who is a sinner needs to be saved from the wrath of God.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.800]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.600]   who hold down the truth in ungodliness.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:04.440]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into the world because the whole world is guilty before
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   God.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.320]   That's why he came.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.160]   He didn't come to reform it.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.480]   He came because everybody born into this world is a sinner.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.400]   Not a man of us has come up to the glory of God.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.040]   Not one of us has honored God or lived to his glory.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.360]   We've all sinned against him.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.160]   We've all done despise to his holy law.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.440]   We've trampled upon it.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.560]   We've all offended him.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.640]   We've all rebelled.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.240]   We are all sinners.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.200]   And remember, God's wrath is upon the sinner.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.680]   God is a holy God.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.600]   And he manifests his wrath partly while we are still in this world and in this life.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.400]   I'm never tired of saying that I believe the world is as it is tonight, partly because
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.840]   the wrath of God is upon it.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.600]   In our cleverness, we thought we could run life and the world without God.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.400]   Well, God's telling us, "Get on with it.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.440]   I'll let you have a chance if you like, and here's the result."
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.880]   It's a part of the punishment, the wrath of God.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.040]   But the wrath of God doesn't stop with this life and this world.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.720]   It goes on beyond it.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:19.560]   And it is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception that if a man dies as a sinner,
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.920]   he just goes on to everlasting perdition.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:30.520]   It's difficult to think on for twelve months, isn't it?
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.880]   It's much more difficult to think on for twelve years.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.440]   You can't think on for twelve centuries.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.400]   Oh, it's impossible to think of twelve millennia.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:47.480]   But what's that out of eternity and everlasting condition?
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:54.320]   And the plain teaching of this world, not my theory, is that a man who dies as a sinner
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.200]   goes to everlasting perdition.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:04.880]   There is no end to it, no hope whatsoever, no end, no termination.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   What is the condition?
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.160]   Well, it's not only like the world is today, but it's much worse, and it goes on and
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.960]   on and on without end.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:24.440]   He came to save sinners from the wrath of God and the punishment that sin so terribly
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   merits.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.560]   Not only that, he came to save us from the bondage of sin, from the slavery of sin, from
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.640]   the tyranny of the devil, from the life of the world, the world, the flesh, the devil.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.040]   We're all in bonds to it, and we can't set ourselves free.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.680]   He came to save sinners.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.480]   How does he say?
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.000]   I'm giving you the great headings of the gospel tonight, that you may review them as you commence
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   this year.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   How does he do it?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.920]   Well, he does it like this.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.240]   Christ Jesus didn't come into the world to tell us how to save ourselves for the good
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.200]   and sufficient reason that we can't do it.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   God had given the ancient nation, the Jews, the Ten Commandments, and he told them as
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.920]   he gave them them, "You keep those and you'll be all right."
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.080]   But they couldn't keep them.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.240]   There wasn't a man who kept them, not one.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.080]   So if Christ Jesus had only come into the world to tell me to save myself, it would
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.640]   have been a useless message.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.320]   I cannot save myself.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.720]   All the best men who've ever tried have come to realize it.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.640]   This man, Saul of Tarsus, that was his great realization.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:37.240]   He saw he was lost, that all his righteousness was dung, rubbish, refuse, hopeless, filthy
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   rags.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.240]   He can't save himself.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.880]   "To will is present with me, but how to perform I know not.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.240]   This law in the members, dragging and enter, he can't liberate himself."
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.200]   Christ Jesus didn't come into the world to tell us how to save ourselves.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.120]   Thank God he came to save us.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   And how did he do it?
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Well, here it is.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:07.520]   He did it by his perfect spotless life, which he lived for us to honor the law of God that
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.840]   we'd broken.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:18.200]   He did it supremely by his death upon the cross, where he gave his soul as an offering
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:25.120]   for sin, where he received the punishment that our sins had deserved.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.880]   That's how he saves.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.320]   We need to be delivered from the guilt of sin.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.080]   He took it on himself.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.000]   He came into the world to do it.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   He submitted to baptism.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.880]   He told John, "You must baptize me.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.080]   I'm putting myself by the side of the sinner.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.560]   I've come to redeem him.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.720]   I'm taking on his sin.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.280]   And God smote him for me.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.120]   God dealt with my sins in him.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.360]   That's how he saves me."
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:56.400]   He saves by dying upon the cross, by giving his life a ransom for many.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:04.240]   And then by his glorious resurrection, conquering the devil, the death, and the grave, and everything,
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   and rising triumphant over it all into the presence of God, there ever to live beside
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   him and ever to make intercession for those for whom he's died.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.400]   Thus he saves by coming, by living, by dying, rising again, ascending, being seated at the
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.680]   right hand of God.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.520]   Christ Jesus came into the world to do the thing himself.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.200]   He came to save, and he saves in that way.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.760]   That's salvation.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.200]   But what does this mean to me, says someone?
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.240]   You say Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the chief.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.120]   What does this salvation mean to me then?
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120]   Listen.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   You notice his terms?
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.720]   "The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.480]   I obtained mercy," he says.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.120]   How be it for this cause, "I obtained mercy."
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:01.720]   He goes on repeating these words, "grace and mercy and longsuffering and kindness."
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   What does it mean?
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.160]   Oh, let me hurriedly put it to you.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:18.480]   Salvation, my dear friend, means this, that because the Son of God received your punishment,
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:28.680]   God forgives you freely for nothing, just as you are at this very moment.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.280]   It's a free gift, the grace of God.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.040]   Grace means favor that is utterly unmerited.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.520]   It means God giving to people who are utterly unworthy and utterly undeserving.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.560]   That's the whole message.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.640]   Because Christ Jesus has taken my guilt and received the punishment that it deserved,
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.560]   God can righteously give me a free pardon.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:00.120]   He asks nothing of me except that I believe this, that I accept, that I believe it is
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.760]   worthy of all acceptation.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.040]   So he gives me pardon and forgiveness.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.880]   I receive the mercy.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.360]   When this man Saul of Tarsus came to see his unutterable sinfulness, that he was the chief
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.560]   of sinners, he said, "What can I do?
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   Where can I turn?
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.560]   I'm altogether lost."
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.120]   But the Son of God who appeared to him on the road to Damascus told him, "It's all right.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.880]   I came into the world because you are what you are, and I've received your punishment,
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.560]   and you can have mercy.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.280]   God forgives you.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.160]   The past can be blotted out."
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.880]   Oh, what a wonderful thing to be able to say on the first Sunday night of 1962.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   If you have sinned until this very moment, if you have sinned all your life, right the
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:53.680]   way through '61, '60, '59, '58, all your life has been a life of sin.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.840]   But if you believe this message, do you know it will all be blotted out at this moment,
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.400]   as if it had never happened at all?
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.000]   The books are cleared.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   The past shall be forgotten.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.480]   Mercy.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   A free pardon.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.720]   An utter absolution.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:17.240]   An entire forgiveness is given immediately to those who believe this message.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.660]   But you know, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.960]   We need not only forgiveness.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.440]   I don't want to make light of forgiveness.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.240]   There's nothing under heaven that I know more wonderful at this moment than just this, that
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:37.800]   all my past has been cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.600]   Don't look back, my friend, if you're a Christian.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   You never need to.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   It's been dealt with.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   It's gone.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.560]   God in Christ has blotted it out.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.080]   The past has been forgotten.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.720]   Oh, what a wonderful thing to know.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.320]   This is the faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, "Never look back again if
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.720]   you believe in Christ."
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.720]   It's all gone.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   God's forgotten it.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:04.320]   As far as the East is from the West, so far has thou removed our transgressions from us.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   There's nothing further.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   Very well.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.320]   But it isn't the only thing.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   Listen.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:14.480]   "Albeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Christ Jesus might show forth
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:21.600]   all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which hereafter believe on him, to life everlasting."
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.920]   Here's the other side.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   "Forgiven."
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   Yes.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   Entirely forgiven.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   Completely blotted out.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   Well, where am I now, then?
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Oh, I need a new life.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   I need a new nature.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   I'm not content with just being forgiven, because I know I'm going back into that same
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   old sinful world, and I'm still the same weak creature, and I'll go down again, I'll sin
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   again, I'll be exactly where I was.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   No, no.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.920]   Everlasting life is offered you.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   What's this?
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   "I'm not content with just being forgiven, because I know I'm going back into that same
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.920]   old sinful world, and I'm still the same weak creature, and I'll go down again, I'll sin
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   again, I'll be exactly where I was."
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   No, no.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   Everlasting life is offered you.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   What's this?
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   "I'm not content with just being forgiven, because I know I'm going back into that same
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   old sinful world, and I'm still the same weak creature, and I'll go down again, I'll sin
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   again, I'll be exactly where I was."
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   No, no.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   Everlasting life is offered you.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   What's this?
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   "Well, I needn't keep you, I've already reminded you of it in my introduction."
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   Everlasting life means a new life.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   A new beginning.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.560]   You know, this gospel offers you a new nature.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.320]   It offers to make you a new man.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.280]   It's not surprising that Paul says it's a faithful saying and worthy of all exhibition.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.360]   He was a living proof of it.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.200]   If there was one thing that was quite inconceivable, it was that Saul of Tarsus should ever be a
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.540]   preacher of the gospel.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.560]   He was a blasphemer, he was a persecutor, he was injurious.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.400]   He was the chief of sinners.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.560]   How can such a man ever become a preacher of the gospel?
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.920]   How can he ever be a Christian?
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   The thing is inconceivable.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.160]   His whole nature is against him.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.160]   Here he is preaching it.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   What is it?
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   Oh, he's been born again.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.360]   So it's not surprising that in writing the second epistle to the Corinthians, in chapter
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:06.320]   five in verse seventeen, he says, "If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:13.520]   All things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.980]   He was a new man.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.680]   He couldn't recognize himself.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.280]   He's no longer Saul of Tarsus.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.800]   He's the apostle Paul.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.000]   He's made a new start, a new man in a new world.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Everything's new.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.440]   That's the thing that's offered to you.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.040]   He says, "This has happened to me that I might be a pattern and an example.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.040]   You needn't be afraid."
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.520]   He says, "It can happen to you.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:40.200]   You can start a new life, a life of deliverance from the shackles and the bondage of sin and
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.880]   Satan and the world and the flesh and the devil, a freedom from fear of death and the
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:50.920]   grave, a life of joy, a life of peace, all that immediately in this world.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:57.960]   And you can begin to look forward to a life of glory beyond the veil, which surpasses
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:05.240]   any possibility of description, to be with Christ, which is far better, to see God, to
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:15.280]   spend eternity in the glory all offered you for nothing, everlasting life, eternal life."
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.100]   That is what salvation means.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.400]   Not that you decide to take a New Year's resolution in this service that you're going
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.760]   to be a better man or a better woman, that you're going to drink less or smoke less
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.960]   or do this, that, whatever you regard as sin.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.960]   I'm not here to mention things.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.960]   No, no, that isn't Christianity.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   This is this.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:38.560]   Believing in this Christ as the Son of God, believing that he died for you and bore your
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.280]   punishment, believing that he can create you anew, make a new man of you, infuse new life
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:49.680]   into you, give you everlasting life, believing it and receiving it here and now.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.360]   Who is it for?
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:59.320]   Is there somebody in this congregation who says, "Well, that's very wonderful, but it
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:06.960]   isn't for me, I'm an old man, I'm an old woman, and I've lived all my life hitherto in sin.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.760]   It's been foul, it's been vile, it's been evil."
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.160]   Or some may say, "I've been very self-righteous, as you've said.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.400]   I've dismissed Christ.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.320]   I haven't seen the need of him.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.560]   Is there hope for me?"
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.400]   The answer is everlasting hope.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.600]   What do I do, you say?
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   I'll tell you.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:28.680]   "Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Christ Jesus might show forth
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:41.040]   all longsuffering, for a patent of them which should hereafter believe on him, to life everlasting."
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:47.400]   You've got nothing to do, my friend, except to believe this message, to say, "Yes, I believe
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:57.760]   it, I believe it is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that the Son of
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.800]   God came from heaven to earth to save me.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:12.200]   I believe it, that he died for me and for my sins.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:20.840]   I believe that God will give me free forgiveness now because his Son has borne my punishment.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.960]   I believe he'll give me new life."
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.720]   I accept your statement.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:32.440]   That's all you've got to do, to believe this faithful saying, which is worthy of all
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:44.960]   acceptation.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:51.720]   The case of the Apostle Paul proves that none is too bad.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:53:03.160]   He says that he is the chief of sinners, to save sinners, the chief of whom am I, the
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:11.840]   self-righteous, proud, blasphemous, arrogant Pharisee that ridiculed the Christ of God
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.560]   and even thought he was doing God's service by massacring Christians.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.800]   There's nothing worse.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.000]   That's the very depth of hell in sin.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.240]   He says, "I've been forgiven, I've been given new life, and if it's happened to me, it can
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   happen to anybody."
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:35.520]   Very well then, my friend, the question I ask you this first Sunday night in 1962 is
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.520]   this.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.640]   Have you believed on him?
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:53.400]   Have you accepted this faithful, reliable, sure, certain statement that God sent his
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:58.760]   Son into this world to deliver you, to save you?
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   Have you believed it?
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   Have you accepted it?
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.800]   If and when you do, you're immediately forgiven.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.520]   You're made a new man and you begin to understand the whole course of life.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.560]   You're already saved out of this world.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.200]   You're saved for God.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.400]   You're saved for the world which is to come, for this Christ is coming back.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.800]   He's going to establish his kingdom and those who believe in him will be with him.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.480]   The others will be destroyed.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.560]   That's the future course of history.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.160]   There is no promise here that wars are going to end.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.840]   I'm told the exact opposite.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.120]   There shall be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.120]   There shall be pestilences.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.440]   There shall be earthquakes.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:40.360]   I expect nothing from this world, so I can never be disappointed.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:47.760]   But I do look forward to a glorious day that is coming when the Son of God will come back
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:57.080]   again into this world, finally to destroy evil and sin, to purge every relic of it that's
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:06.280]   in the cosmos out of existence, and to make the world perfect again, and to dwell in it
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:14.240]   with all who believe this faithful Savior, who believed on him.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.440]   There's the certain world.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:26.280]   The world is as it is because it's full of sinners, and the one thing we need is to be
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:37.320]   saved as sinners out of the world into the kingdom of God, and then with patience to
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.960]   wait for the great and the final consummation which is coming when the Son of God will again
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:50.560]   appear in all his glory to set up his everlasting kingdom.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:56:00.760]   It is a faithful Savior, and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   world.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.520]   He's been, he's done it.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:16.280]   He will come again to receive unto himself all who so believe in him.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.720]   Do you?
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:26.680]   Make no tarry.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.680]   Fly to him.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   Believe on him.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680]   And be ye saved.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680]   Amen.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:37.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
