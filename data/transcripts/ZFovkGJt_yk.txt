[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.600]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, in the sixteenth verse.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.640]   The sixteenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.240]   And of his fullness of all we received, and grace for grace, and of his fullness of all
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.960]   we received, and grace upon grace, grace upon grace, grace for grace.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.880]   Now here, those who attend here regularly will recall, we are considering what is, after
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.880]   all, a great and a very wonderful summary of the whole of the Christian Gospel and the
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040]   meaning of the Christian salvation.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.200]   The apostle here, in this prologue, this introduction to his Gospel, is reminding those early Christians
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.400]   to whom he wrote the Gospel and for whom he wrote it, of the very essence of the Christian
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   faith.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.640]   He wrote it because, even as early as that, certain false teachings have been creeping
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.280]   in and there was confusion with regard to the person of our Lord and with regard to
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   the character and the nature of this great Christian salvation.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.800]   So the apostle wrote his Gospel in order that he might correct the errors and, still more
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.760]   important, display to the people the truth concerning our Lord and his great salvation.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.200]   And here, in a very wonderful phrase, he sums it up.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:59.080]   To be a Christian means to receive of the fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.960]   That is why he, at the very outset, tells us who the Lord Jesus Christ is.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.760]   In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God and the Word was God.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.840]   There must be no difficulty about this.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.080]   The world is fallen and the world is in sin.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.240]   The business of the Christian salvation is to save the world and to save men.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.520]   And the great message is that no man was adequate to this.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.560]   And that is why the incarnation had to take place.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.120]   All men had failed.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.800]   Adam, the perfect man, had failed.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.080]   He had been tempted and had fallen.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.200]   And all the mighty succession of patriarchs and psalmists and prophets, they had all failed.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.120]   Man cannot save himself, still less others.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.560]   It was necessary that the Son of God should come into the world and be born as a man.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.720]   The Word was made flesh, as we are reminded in this context, and dwelt among us.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.240]   And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.720]   and truth.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.280]   Now, it is because he was full of grace and truth himself that he can impart it to us.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.200]   And so we can receive of his fullness.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   If he were not full in that sense, he could not save us.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.760]   But he is perfect God, he is perfect man.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.160]   And he has done everything that is necessary for our salvation.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.760]   So the Christian salvation is entirely in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.800]   We do not save ourselves, we cannot do that.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.960]   We have all sinned, we have all gone astray.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.440]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.800]   And the great message is that he is the Savior.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.000]   He in his fullness has done everything.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.880]   And that is what makes a man a Christian, is that he receives of this fullness.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.440]   Now, that is the great theme that is put before us in this verse, and which we have been considering
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.760]   together for a number of Sunday mornings.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.440]   And we have reached the stage in which we are looking at it like this.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.800]   The best way to interpret Scripture always is to allow Scripture itself to do so.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.480]   You compare Scripture with Scripture.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   And we have seen that the Apostle Paul in the first chapter of the first epistle to
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:43.040]   the Corinthians, and in verse 30, has put it all in a very striking phrase again.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.320]   But of him, he says, that is to say, of God, but of him are ye, that is to say, Christian
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:05:00.840]   people, in Christ Jesus, who of God hath been made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.840]   and redemption.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.280]   You see, it is another way of saying that it is all in Christ.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.680]   It is this fullness that is in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.880]   God, he says, has made him to us.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.480]   He has made him to be wisdom, and righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.040]   As he puts it again, he is the all and in all.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.960]   Christ is the Alpha, the Omega, the First, the Last, the Beginning, the End.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.920]   It is all in him.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.520]   And we receive of this fullness that is in him, and grace upon grace.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.920]   Now, at the immediate point we have arrived, we are looking at the Lord Jesus Christ made
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.440]   of God unto us, sanctification.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.520]   We have already looked at him as made unto us wisdom.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.880]   Christ is God's wisdom, which means this.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.840]   The world, as I say, is fallen and it is in sin.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.880]   It is full of trouble.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.080]   Civilizations have done their best to redress the evils, to mitigate the wrongs and the
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   injustices.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.800]   That is the purpose, as we have seen, of all governments and all authorities and all powers.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.320]   But they cannot save the world.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.960]   They cannot save an individual.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   They can restrain evil.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.640]   They are called to do that.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.080]   They are meant to do that, and they do that, but they cannot save.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:38.640]   And men with all his knowledge and all his striving and all his endeavors, he cannot.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.240]   So the great message of the Bible is that God has done something.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.000]   This is God's wisdom, not men's wisdom.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.280]   God's wisdom, and God's wisdom is to send his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.680]   and for sin.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:06.120]   The Christian gospel is God's wisdom, God's way, God's method of redeeming mankind.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   So Christ is made unto us wisdom.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.880]   If you want to know God's mind about the world and what can be done with respect to
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.160]   it, you see it all in Jesus Christ.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.960]   God has acted in this world in the person of his only begotten Son.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.480]   So he has made wisdom unto us.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   And this, according to the Bible, is the only way whereby the world ever can be put right,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.800]   or whereby any individual can ever be put right.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.040]   He takes God's wisdom in Christ to redeem us.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.000]   And then he's made unto us righteousness, which means it is the only way whereby a man
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.400]   can ever be just in the sight of God.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.880]   Our supreme need, all of us, is to be blessed of God.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.280]   We've come to the end of ourselves.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.240]   It is God alone who can bless us and who can help us.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.440]   But the great question is, how can we approach God?
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.160]   What right of access have we into the presence of God?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.560]   For we are all guilty, we are all sinful, we've all rebelled against God, all we like
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.080]   sheep have gone astray.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.200]   There is no health in us.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.760]   We are full of unworthiness.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.960]   We cannot enter, as we are, into the presence of God, who is holy and just and pure.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.560]   It's impossible.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.360]   But this is the wonderful part of the message.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.600]   That's exactly why God sent his only Son into the world.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.720]   That's why the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.520]   In order that having cleared our debt and having kept God's perfect law, he might give
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.280]   us this righteousness of his own and put it upon us and enable us to enter into the presence
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.360]   of God.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.480]   Christ is made unto us righteousness.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.760]   You see, that's the first great problem that confronts any man who realizes his need of
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   God.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.320]   There's a question put by Job at the dawn of history, "How can a man be just with God?"
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   How easy it is to say, "I'm going to pray," but when you realize what you're doing, when
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.880]   you realize that you're entering into the presence of the eternal God, who is light
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:27.040]   and in whom is no darkness at all, you realize the utter impossibility.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:34.480]   But this is the wonderful message, that God has made Christ to be righteousness unto us.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:42.520]   He clothes us with the cloak of Christ's perfect righteousness, and in him we can venture into
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.240]   the presence of God and know that he's ready to receive us.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.920]   We are reconciled.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.360]   Christ is made unto us righteousness.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:58.080]   Our sins are freely forgiven because Christ has borne our punishment in his own body on
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   the tree.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:05.280]   Christ is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, but also sanctification.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:11.200]   In other words, it isn't enough merely that we should be forgiven.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   That is essential.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.120]   There is no dealing between God and men until this question of our guilt is dealt with.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.760]   That's the first question.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.440]   And we are, it's dealt with in the righteousness.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.760]   But that isn't enough, I say.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.960]   Before we can have fellowship and communion with God, there must be a likeness of nature.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.700]   There must be some correspondence.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.440]   So we need to be renewed.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.120]   We need to be made holy.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120]   God is holy.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.920]   And all who truly commune with him must have an element of holiness in them.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:47.240]   Well, now that's this great process of sanctification, which, as I've reminded you, is defined in
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.760]   the Westminster Confession in this way.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:57.960]   It is this process whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God and
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:05.840]   are enabled more and more to die unto sin and to live unto righteousness.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:14.400]   Now then, Christ is made unto us sanctification as well as wisdom and as righteousness.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.920]   And we've been looking into this and we've seen that this process of sanctification means
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.800]   that we are separated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God, from the
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.520]   world into the kingdom of heaven, put into a new position.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:37.120]   Not only that, regenerated, born again, given a new nature, given a new start, born of the
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.860]   Spirit.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:46.720]   And so we begin to live a new life, which is defined in the New Testament as the law
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.640]   of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.800]   Now, that is what a Christian really is.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.720]   A Christian is a man who is living this new life in the Spirit.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.000]   The apostle contrasts it with the life in the flesh.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.940]   He says when we were in the flesh we did certain things, but now we are in the Spirit.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:14.060]   We are living a new life in the Spirit that we may bear fruit unto God.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.320]   Now then, that is the essence of the Christian's position.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.640]   And this of course is of prime and supreme importance.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   A Christian is not a man who is trying to live a good life.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.560]   A Christian is not a man who believes that because he does certain things that he is
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   therefore a Christian.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   No, no.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   He's been born again.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   He's got new life in him.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.760]   He's got the Spirit in him.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.440]   He's no longer living that old life in the flesh after the world and its outlook.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.960]   He's living an entirely new life.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   He's in a new realm.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.280]   He's dead indeed unto sin.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.360]   He's alive unto God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.640]   He's dead unto the law.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.080]   He's a free man in Christ Jesus.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.040]   And he's got a new power, a new life, a new principle, a new disposition working within
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   him.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.320]   Now the great question is, how does that work itself out in practice?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.400]   And that's the thing that I want to consider with you in particular this morning.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.880]   How does this all work out in practice?
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.840]   Now we've got to start with a man's position.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.440]   We've got to realize who and what we are before we can do anything.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.800]   But having realized who and what we are, we must now consider how it works itself out
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   in practice.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.120]   Well now, the best commentary it seems to me on this is that portion which we've read
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.920]   together just now in Paul's epistle to the Philippians in the second chapter, and in
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.720]   particular verses 12 and 13.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:45.280]   "Wherefore, my beloved," he says, "as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:53.600]   only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:02.480]   For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.320]   Now this is a magnificent statement of this whole question, and particularly when we take
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.400]   it as we're going to do in its own setting and in its own context.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:20.240]   Now you notice the significant statement, "Work out your own salvation."
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.320]   In other words, you've been given it, you are saved, you've got the salvation.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   Work it out now, says the apostle.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.720]   Here he was, he was not able to be with them, he was a prisoner.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.280]   And he says, "I'm sorry, I wish I could be with you, but I can't."
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.200]   But it's all right, he says, "though I can't be with you."
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.120]   Go on working it out.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.100]   Work out your own salvation.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.360]   This great thing that's been given you, this new life that's in you, work it out.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.680]   Work out your own salvation with fear and with trembling.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:15:00.840]   Now the first point we have to make is this, that in this outworking, this living of this
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:09.240]   Christian life which has been put into us by the Lord Jesus Christ, there are two elements.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.120]   And some people are in trouble over the two elements.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.880]   You see, he says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for because it is
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.280]   God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.420]   Now we are not going to stay with this, but I'm anxious to clear up a point of difficulty
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.840]   with many, as it were, in passing.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.360]   There are those who feel that this whole question of sanctification is something that is done
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.600]   for us by the Lord himself, that we do nothing.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.360]   And their teaching of sanctification is, "Hand it over to the Lord, he'll do it for you."
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.320]   Don't you struggle, don't you do anything, hand it over to the Lord.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   But you see, the apostle says, "Work out," and it's a very strong word that he used.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.680]   It's a very forceful word.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.400]   He says, "Work out thoroughly, go on doing so, be diligent in doing so, give all your
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.280]   might to it, work out your own salvation."
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.480]   He's urging them to play their part.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.400]   Well does this mean, says someone, that after all the Christian is just like a good moral
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:22.200]   man in the world, dependent solely upon his own efforts, and his own power, and his own
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   ability?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   Oh no.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:32.240]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for because it is God that worketh
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.320]   in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.440]   In other words, the position of the Christian is this.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.040]   He has got to do the working out, but thank God he is given power which enables him to
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   do so.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.640]   He's not a machine.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   It isn't done with him in a passive state and condition.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.560]   It isn't done automatically.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:01.620]   He works with all his might and mean, but the power is given to him by the risen Lord.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:08.040]   He receives this fullness from the risen Lord, of his fullness of all we receive, and grace
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.160]   upon grace.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.880]   He receives this energy divine which enables him to work out what he couldn't work out
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   before.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:22.200]   Now I think I've used an illustration before which seems to me to be helpful to bring out
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   this point.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   It's the illustration taken from what our Lord did so many times during the days of
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   his flesh.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.960]   For instance, that miracle of healing the man with a withered hand, the withered arm.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.400]   There was a man whose whole trouble was that he couldn't move his arm.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   It was paralyzed.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:50.040]   And yet you remember when our Lord came to him, he said, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.200]   But that was the one thing the man couldn't do.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   He was paralyzed.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   That was his trouble.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.600]   And yet our Lord says, "Do what you can't do.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.880]   And the man stretched it forth.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   What had happened?
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:11.040]   Ah, in our Lord's command to him to stretch forth his arm, his hand, the power was given.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.560]   The man has to make the effort, but in and of himself he can't do it.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.280]   But ah, the energy of Christ has come into him in the command, so he's able to do what
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   he couldn't do before.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.840]   That's precisely the thing we have here.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.360]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.400]   You don't sit down in meetings and wait for something wonderful to happen to receive your
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.920]   sanctification as a gift.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   No, no.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.000]   Go and work it out, he says, with great diligence and thoroughness and keep on at it.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.480]   Put your backs into it.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.360]   Work it out.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.680]   But you're not left to yourselves.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:51.480]   It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.480]   Very well.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.160]   There is that first great principle which we have to observe.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.600]   But let's go on from there.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   This is how the Christian is able to live the Christian life.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.280]   There he is, he's got this new life, he's got this new power, this new ability, this
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.200]   new potential, if you like, this new dynamic in him.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.360]   Now then, how does it actually work out in practice?
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:23.840]   Well, the first great thing that the apostle says is that the Christian's got a new mind,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.400]   got a new understanding, got a new outlook.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:38.600]   And when he says let this mind be in you, he says it is in you, let it operate in you.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.280]   Let this control you.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.120]   Let this mind be also in you.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:49.640]   Now, this is an appeal that can only be addressed to a Christian.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.520]   It's no use going to a man who's not a Christian and saying let this mind be in you which was
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.960]   also in Christ Jesus, because he can't do it.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.720]   You see, he's like that man with a withered arm, left to himself.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:09.520]   It's no use just telling him as he is, before a man can receive this exhortation, he must
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520]   be a Christian.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.520]   Well, the apostle is writing to Christians.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.320]   And that is one of the great fallacies, that the world thinks that it can take up the Christian
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.200]   ethic and put it into practice itself.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.920]   It can't.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.600]   Christ would never have come into the world if men could have done that.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.000]   That is one of the greatest fallacies of all.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.160]   Christ was not merely a teacher.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.560]   He wasn't merely an example.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.400]   Christ as teacher and example damns me more than anything in the whole Bible.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.200]   Because, look at his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.880]   We can't keep the Ten Commandments even as they are.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.280]   But listen to his interpretation, the spiritual interpretation, and we're all immediately
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   condemned.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.600]   No, no.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.840]   This exhortation is addressed only to those who are already Christians.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.440]   You can't get Christian conduct from people who are not Christian.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.920]   It's impossible.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.560]   You first are made a Christian by the rebirth, and then the exhortation comes to you, let
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.080]   this mind be in you.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   Well, why?
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.520]   Well, because, as I say, it's already in you.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.680]   You remember how this same apostle puts it in the 16th verse of the second chapter of
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.560]   the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.200]   He says, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?"
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.400]   And he answers, "But we have the mind of Christ."
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.680]   A Christian has the mind of Christ, and he must let this mind work in him and operate
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   in him.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   Now, how does it do so?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.640]   "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:57.840]   much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.720]   Now that's a part of the mind of Christ.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.480]   Fear and trembling.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   How is a man to live the Christian life in a world like this?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.440]   How can a man live a pure life, a holy life in a world like this?
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.440]   That's the problem.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:21.400]   Well, the first thing we are told is, "Do so with fear and trembling."
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   Why?
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.960]   Why the fear and the trembling?
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:31.000]   Oh, the answer is, "Because of the holiness of God."
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.720]   What we are told about the unbeliever in the Old Testament is, "There is no fear of God
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.400]   before their eyes."
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.880]   But isn't that the trouble in this country today?
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.240]   There is no fear of God amongst people.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.000]   Every man's a law unto himself.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.600]   He has no respect for ordinary law, still less for the law of God.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.840]   The modern generation doesn't fear God, and it doesn't fear men, and you've got chaos
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.560]   in the world.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.120]   The first need of men is to fear God.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.240]   All men's troubles arise from the fact that he doesn't know God, and he hasn't got this
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   awe, this fear of God and the holiness of God.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.440]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:28.420]   The Christian realizes that, so he walks with fear and trembling.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.560]   But you see, he alone does this.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.680]   It is Christ who taught him to do this.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.800]   You remember how our Lord prayed?
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.000]   He prayed, "Holy Father."
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   He says, "Our Father, yes, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.240]   Reverence and godly fear, fear and trembling.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.520]   This is the first great thing that's needed, and Christ sanctifies us and is our sanctification
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:04.560]   by giving us this knowledge of God and the holiness and the glory of God.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.720]   And a man begins to fear, and he realizes something of who he is and what he is meant
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   to be.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:19.000]   So, that is a part of the fear and trembling, but there's another element in it.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.280]   The Christian lives in fear and trembling because of the state of the world.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.400]   It's described for us in the fifteenth verse.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:35.280]   Do all things in verse fourteen without murmurings and disputings, that you may be blameless
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:45.760]   and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.680]   generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.280]   Now, this is a very wonderful picture.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:03.520]   You as Christians, as the apostle to these people at Philippi, are like the stars in
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.960]   the heavens on a dark night.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   There's darkness, but these bright shining stars stand out.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.600]   They stand out by contrast, because everything else is darkness.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.880]   Lights in the heaven, luminaries in the firmament.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.280]   But you notice the description of the world.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:31.480]   You see, it's described as a place of darkness, but he adds to it crooked and perverse generation.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.360]   Now, here again, you see, is the whole problem.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.000]   That's why the world is as it is.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.800]   He doesn't know that it's crooked.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   He doesn't know it's perverse.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.160]   Isn't that one of our great problems today?
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.760]   Isn't that the essence of the modern moral problem in this world in which we live?
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:59.360]   That men and women don't realize the perverseness of it all, and the crookedness, and the twisting,
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.240]   and the foulness, and the wrongness, and the blackness, the darkness of it all.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.440]   And that's why they're not afraid.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.200]   They plunge into it, nothing to fear, and so you get your tragedies.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.360]   Now, the Christian, you see, is altogether different.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   The Christian realizes that this is an evil world, and that he has to fight the world,
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.200]   and the flesh, and the devil.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.440]   And he knows something he knows that nobody else knows, something of the power of sin
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.800]   and the power of evil.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.280]   The Bible's full of that sort of teaching.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.640]   You remember this same apostle Paul in writing to the Ephesians, puts it in the second chapter,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.120]   he says, "Yea, where he quickened to wear dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:57.760]   past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.640]   power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.400]   That's the Christian, that's the biblical view of this world.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.480]   The Christian doesn't say, "Isn't life wonderful?
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.280]   Isn't this world a wonderful place?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.280]   How perfect it is."
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.200]   No, the Bible says it's a very evil place.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   It is so evil that it takes the Son of God to leave heaven and to be born as a baby in
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.040]   Bethlehem, and to endure the contradiction of sinners against himself in this world for
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.520]   thirty-three years, and to die a cruel death upon the cross, and to be buried, and to rise
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.720]   again in order to save men out of it.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.600]   The world is an evil place.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.200]   The power of the devil, the power of hell, the devil is described as the God of this
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   world.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.320]   Now, it's only a Christian who realizes that, and because he realizes it, he walks in this
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.680]   world with fear and trembling.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.240]   He's not full of a blatant self-confidence, feeling that he can stand up to everything.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.280]   "I'm all right, I know other men of fear, but I'm not going to...
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   That's the men of the world, isn't it?
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   That's the non-Christian."
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.720]   And down he goes into disaster.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.480]   But the Christian knows it's an evil place, and that the power of evil is terrible.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:19.320]   So he walks and lives in this world with fear and trembling.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.360]   "Let him that thinketh, he standeth," says the apostle to the Corinthians, "Let him that
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:31.560]   thinketh, he standeth, take heed, lest he fall."
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.120]   There's no ridiculous self-confidence about the Christian.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.880]   He knows his own weakness.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.600]   He sees the enticing terms of ill.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.360]   The world and its voices are clamoring at him and shouting at him and enticing him and
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   drawing him, and he knows his own weakness.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.880]   You'll get it all in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, how he had to walk through Vanity
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.080]   Fair, and he realized the danger.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.200]   That's the very thing that the apostle is saying here, with fear and trembling.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:08.200]   And another element in his fear and trembling is this, that he knows that he has got to
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.560]   stand in a final judgment.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.640]   You see, the man who's not a Christian, he lives for this life only, this world only.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.400]   There is no other world to him.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.280]   And he never gives any thought to death.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   He never gives any thought to what lies beyond death.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.320]   That's where he's such a fool, because he's got to die.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   Everybody's got to die.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.960]   It doesn't matter how, whether it's a bomb that's exploded or whether it's old age or
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   whether it's some infection.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.680]   We've all got to die.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.760]   It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.320]   And the Christian knows that.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.000]   Listen to the apostle Paul putting it about himself in 2 Corinthians 5.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.520]   We must all appear before the judgment throne of Christ and give an account of the deeds
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.080]   done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:09.440]   Therefore, he says, knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.400]   And this is still the truth.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:19.160]   We must all appear before the judgment throne of Christ and give an account of the deeds
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.840]   done in the body.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.640]   What a wonderful thing to be a man and to live in this world is according to the Christian
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.960]   gospel.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.920]   We are responsible beings.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.500]   We have to give an account of our stewardship.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.460]   We have to show how we've conducted and comported us.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:40.480]   We must all stand and give an account.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:47.600]   And the moment a man realizes that, he begins to walk with fear and trembling.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.200]   He doesn't waltz through life.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.600]   He doesn't just go through it thoughtlessly, taking things as they come and never looking
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   ahead.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.120]   He keeps his eye on that which is coming, the judgment.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.920]   And therefore, he walks and works and lives in fear and trembling.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.080]   But that's only the beginning.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.880]   There is something else that the apostle immediately adds to that.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.120]   He says, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for those reasons.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.920]   But here's a second reason, he says, for working it out.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   You are the sons of God, verse 15, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:37.880]   God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom we shine as
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.440]   lights of the world.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.080]   Now this is a wonderful thing again, the most wonderful appeal.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.960]   And of course, it can only be addressed to a Christian.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.480]   You are sons of God.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.200]   You've been born again.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.680]   You've become a partaker of the divine nature.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.200]   You've been renewed in the very spirit of your mind.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.840]   You are not what you used to be.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.960]   There is an absolute division between Christian and non-Christian.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.560]   The non-Christian is a natural man.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.240]   He's a man in the flesh.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.800]   But the Christian isn't.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.760]   That man is an alien from God, he's under the wrath of God.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.400]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, he's not only reconciled to God, he's a
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.640]   son of God.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.200]   He's been adopted into the heavenly family.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.320]   He's no longer a stranger, a foreigner.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.880]   He's a child of God.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.040]   He's a member of the household of God.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.160]   He's received an adoption.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.160]   God's his father.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.600]   He's God's child.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   He's a son of God.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.800]   Sons of God, says the apostle.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:56.080]   Now, it should be enough, shouldn't it, just to say that in and of itself.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.200]   What the apostle is saying, in other words, is this.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.640]   Remember who you are.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   And if you remember who you are, well, you live accordingly.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.200]   How can I illustrate this?
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.320]   Let me try it like this.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.160]   Parents at Christmas time, their children are invited to parties.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.720]   Here's the child preparing to go to the party.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.200]   What are the final instructions that the parent gives that child?
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   "Now, remember that you're a good boy or a good girl."
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   Why?
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.280]   "Remember that you behave yourself nicely and politely."
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   Why?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.320]   Well, the reputation of the family is in a sense in the hands of that child.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.240]   If the child misbehaves, the people who are holding the party, they won't blame the child,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.560]   but they'll say a good deal about the parents.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.840]   Remember who you are.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.440]   You remember the great appeal of Nelson and the mourning of Trafalgar.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.720]   England expects that every man this day will do his duty.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.280]   Remember who you are.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.560]   And when you travel in a foreign country, you mustn't think of yourself as an individual.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.720]   If you get into trouble, your country is involved.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   You are the custodian for the time being of the honor and the good name of your country.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.640]   And this is the mighty appeal that comes.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.200]   "Look here," says Paul, "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Why?
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.400]   Because you are sons of God in the midst of this crooked and perverse generation.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.320]   You are like lights in the heavens shining in the darkness.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.360]   Be sure that you are shining.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:44.280]   "Let your light so shine before men," says our Lord, "that they may see your good works,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   but glorify your Father which is in heaven."
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.920]   There it is to perfection.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.720]   You see, you are living in this world, says our Lord there.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.880]   "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, but they won't glorify
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.680]   you, they will glorify your Father which is in heaven."
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.040]   They'll look at you and they'll see that you're different.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.800]   They'll see that you're as different from them as light is from darkness.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.840]   And they'll say, "What's the secret of these people?
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.720]   Why are these people different?
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.640]   Why do they live in a different way?
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.080]   Why are they more reliable?
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.320]   Why are they more loving?
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.880]   Why are they more ready to help?
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.680]   Why is it to them I go always when I'm in trouble?
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   What is it?"
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.280]   And there's only one answer.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:30.640]   They are children of their Father which is in heaven.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.160]   And so you see, this becomes a great motive to the Christian.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.120]   Because he's in Christ, because he's receiving of the fullness that is in the Lord Jesus
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.720]   Christ, because he's got this mind of Christ in him and this new outlook, he realizes that
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:51.000]   he's a son of God and it gives him an utterly new motive for living as Christ himself lived
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.120]   when he was here in this world of time.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.200]   And if a man isn't moved by this appeal, there's only one explanation.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.920]   He's not a Christian.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.520]   He's not a son of God.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.720]   He doesn't know it and he doesn't feel the appeal.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.600]   But if you've got anything of the Spirit of the Son in you, why you say, "I must do this,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.960]   not for my own sake, but for the sake of my heavenly Father, for the sake of the family
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.900]   to which I belong."
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:23.060]   And in addition, of course, the child is anxious to please the parent, anxious to have the
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:31.800]   approbation and the praise of his parent, anxious to do everything he can in order to
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.820]   please the God who has been so gracious and good and kind to him.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.480]   But let me close with what is perhaps the greatest appeal of all.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:53.920]   "Let this mind be in you," which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:02.640]   thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.960]   upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   cross.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   What does it mean?
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.280]   Why does the apostle bring that in at that point?
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.440]   He's dealing with personal relationships.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.720]   He's dealing with the life of the church at Philippi and the way in which Christians are
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.040]   to conduct and comport themselves in this evil world.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.920]   Why does he bring this in?
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:41.040]   I say this is the greatest encouragement and the greatest incentive of all, the example
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.880]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:49.400]   There he was in the form of God.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.120]   John puts it, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   God."
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:05.240]   In the form of God, everlastingly the Son of the Father, co-equal, co-eternal, sharing
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:12.760]   the everlasting and eternal glory in all its fullness.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:20.400]   But says the apostle, he didn't regard that as a prize to be held onto at all costs.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.200]   That's the real meaning of the words, "Though thought it not robbery to be equaled with
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   God."
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.120]   He didn't say, "I must remain like this.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.320]   I can't forgo any part of this."
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   He didn't do that.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.840]   He did the exact opposite.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.760]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:47.560]   Though he is the eternal Son of God and had always been, and manifesting all the fullness
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:54.720]   of the divine effulgence and glory, he made himself of no reputation.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:01.360]   He was born as a helpless little baby in a stable in Bethlehem and was put into a manger.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.400]   All the signs of the glory had been laid aside.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:11.760]   Born in the likeness of flesh, in the likeness of men, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:17.280]   people looked at him and saw nothing but an ordinary baby because the signs of the glory
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   had been laid aside.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.360]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.840]   He comes as if he were nothing but a man.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.320]   Made himself of no reputation.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.800]   And took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   of the cross.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.480]   Now, you see, the whole argument is this.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.840]   It is only a Christian, it is only a man who has got this new life, it's only the man who
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:03.680]   has got the Spirit of God in him who realizes what God has done for us in Christ.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.400]   The world this morning isn't interested in this.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.960]   Thinks a little about it at Christmas time, but it doesn't know what it's thinking even
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   then.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.240]   It talks about this babe in the manger and it seems very wonderful, but it's all soon
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   forgotten.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.720]   But it's the Christian who understands this.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.480]   He says, "This is what's happened.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:29.840]   The Son of God, for my sake, for my salvation, humbled himself, laid aside his own rights
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.320]   and prerogatives and what he as it were wanted to do.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:38.200]   He humbled himself, he became obedient in order to save men and to carry out God's
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.880]   wisdom in men's salvation.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.480]   He went through all that, ending even with the death of the cross.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.560]   He was obedient unto death."
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:56.400]   In other words, if I may put it in our own terminology, what the Father said to the Son
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   is this.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   "I must punish sin.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:09.840]   I cannot receive men unto myself as he is in sin and by nature.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:17.800]   Men must honor my law, but there was no man who could do it.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:24.760]   And so the great idea was conceived that the Son of God should become man, the most tremendous
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.520]   thing that's ever happened.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.560]   And the Son agreed.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   He became obedient.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.400]   He said, "I'll do it.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   Here am I.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.800]   Send me."
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.200]   And he was sent.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.040]   And he lived as a man.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.040]   And the Father said, "I'm going to lay the sins of men upon you and punish them in
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   you."
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.120]   And in the garden of Gethsemane he went through that agony of struggle.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.120]   He said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   Is this the only way?
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.560]   Is there no other way whereby men can be forgiven but that I receive the punishment?
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:04.240]   Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done."
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.320]   He was obedient.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.100]   He didn't consider himself.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.960]   He considered only the Father's glory, the Father's will, the Father's great and glorious
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.960]   purpose.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:19.040]   He lived to honor God and to obey him.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:24.240]   And so he endured even the death of the cross.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.240]   Was obedient unto death.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:33.080]   Yea, even the death of the cross.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.040]   And you and I are to live like that, says the apostle.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.740]   Christ gave his life.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.480]   He laid aside the signs of the eternal glory first, but then in this world he gave this
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   life of obedience.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.900]   He lived the life of holiness in obedience to his Father.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:57.840]   But he even gave his very life to carry out the Father's will with respect to our salvation.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.520]   Let this mind be in you also.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.160]   That's the way the Christian is sanctified.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   That's the way the Christian lives the holy life.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.680]   He says, "I'm not my own.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.240]   I've been bought with a price.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.160]   The Son of God has died for me."
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.520]   He left the courts of heaven.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.420]   He endured the contradiction of sinners against himself.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.120]   He even bled and died for me.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   I have no right to live as I want to.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.600]   That's sanctification, working out this, this mind in us.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:34.120]   As he did that for me, in obedience to his Father's will.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:42.480]   So I must be ready to do anything that I may be obedient to the Father's will.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.440]   Whatever the cost, the world may laugh at me and deride me.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.860]   It may cost me professionally, financially.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.840]   It may mean this and that, ostracism from certain polite circles.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.560]   Doesn't matter.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:03.840]   When I consider what the Son of God did for me, there is nothing which is too great.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   For me to do for him.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.760]   You are not your own.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.680]   You have been bought with a price.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:20.040]   Wherefore, glorify God in your bodies as well as in your spirits.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.720]   Well, my dear friends, our time is gone.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.100]   We'll have to continue this great theme, God willing, next Sunday morning again.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:32.120]   But this is Christ made unto us, sanctification.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:40.280]   This is how we are enabled to work out our own salvation, with fear and trembling, while
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.480]   we are in this world.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:53.720]   And until we go on to the glory everlasting and are exalted, even as Christ was exalted,
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:58.680]   and spend our eternity with him.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:07.240]   Let us now join together in singing our closing hymn, which is hymn number 531.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   531.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.760]   March on my soul with strength.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.480]   March forward, void of fear.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   531.
