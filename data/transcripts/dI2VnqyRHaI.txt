[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Hello everyone, just a little note before we start to let you know that the following
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.280]   episode is not for sensitive ears.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.560]   We are going to talk about a crime against a child in a moment and I'll use as few
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.920]   details as possible, but thanks for understanding.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.960]   Today's episode needs a backstory and it's a chilling backstory set in Denham Springs,
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.840]   a rough town east of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.060]   There a 40 year old man, Gerald Borderlin, already a convicted rapist on the morning
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.480]   of November 15th, 2002, abducted his stepdaughter, Courtney, a 12 year old, took her by knife
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   point to his car, drove her across state lines to Mississippi, forced her to undress, and
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.120]   assaulted her in an unspeakable way.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.600]   He then led her to a riverbank, pushed her to the ground, strangled her to death, hid
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.200]   her body under a brush pile, and drove away.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.320]   Borderlin was caught a few days later and confessed.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.320]   It took less than an hour of deliberation for a jury to convict him of first degree
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.240]   murder and it took less than an hour of deliberation for a jury to give him the death penalty.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.040]   Borderlin waived his right to appeal, saying in court, "I would commit the same crime
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.600]   again if ever given the chance."
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.580]   A state supreme court opinion found his decision made with a clear mind and upheld Borderlin's
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.800]   right to waive all appeals, arriving at the conclusion that he was a "sexual sadist"
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.100]   and that his criminal history showed escalating patterns of violence.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.080]   For his final days on earth, he was sent to death row at a maximum security prison in
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.960]   Louisiana called the Alcatraz of the South, or simply Angola.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.800]   Angola is the largest maximum security prison in the US.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.600]   An 18,000 acre complex comprised of five former plantations now home to 6,300 prisoners, limited
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.920]   to only murderers, rapists, armed robbers, and habitual felons.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.120]   The average sentence here is 88 years, with 3,200 people in one place serving life sentences.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.760]   Ninety percent of the inmates will die here, but only a couple by execution.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.180]   But as Borderlin's execution date drew close, the Lord providentially landed John Piper
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.460]   in Angola.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.320]   On November 20, 2009, Piper toured the prison with the notorious warden, Burl Kane, a forthright
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.220]   Christian and a man with a near-mythical reputation for turning Angola, once known as the bloodiest
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.040]   prison in the South, into a model facility.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.740]   As he drove Piper around the enormous campus, Kane, always eager for death row inmates to
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.480]   hear the gospel, turned to Piper and asked if he'd be willing to meet with a condemned
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.940]   prisoner.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.460]   Piper agreed, and Kane drove to the solitary confinement cells.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.480]   A few moments later, Piper was face to face with Gerald Borderlin and given 30 minutes.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.280]   "Never have I felt a greater urgency to say the good news plainly and plead from my
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.540]   heart," Piper recounted.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.300]   He shared the gospel, pled with Borderlin to treasure Christ, and asked him to read
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   the gospels until the beauty of Christ gripped his heart.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.320]   That was of utmost urgency.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.920]   They prayed together twice.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.380]   Piper took a picture of Gerald on his iPhone and promised to pray for him and to write
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.820]   him letters later.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.460]   Moments later, in Angola's chapel before 800 prisoners, Piper preached from John 6
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.460]   on Jesus' feeding of the 5,000 and his walk on water.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.380]   "I preached with all my heart to those who could fit in the chapel," Piper recounted
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.380]   later.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.140]   "I pulled no punches."
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.920]   Many other prisoners watched on closed circuit television, including Borderlin and his fellow
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.740]   death row inmates.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.980]   The result from this afternoon remains one of my all-time favorite sermons, "Piper
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.820]   at His Most Urgent."
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.260]   And today I want to feature this clip from the beginning of that sermon, and when you
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.220]   hear Gerald's name, you'll know a bit of the backstory.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.660]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.940]   This has been a really remarkable afternoon, as you can imagine.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.700]   My first time here, and hope not my last.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.300]   But I have been moved.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.700]   I just want to greet the several brothers whose hands I shook over on death row.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.660]   I told them to be watching on Channel 21, and they said they would be, so I said I would
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.500]   remember you.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.140]   And Gerald, you said you'd be watching.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.340]   I want you to listen real carefully.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.260]   I hope you are.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.420]   I've seen the lay of the land, and I've heard remarkable stories.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.460]   The work of God here is unprecedented, as you know, in prisons.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:52.540]   I feel a weight on me that I hope the Lord processes in terms of power and not oppression.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.700]   And the reason I feel such a weight is because I know most of you aren't leaving this place
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.140]   except to go to heaven.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.060]   And that's heavy.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.460]   It's got to be a battle lots of times.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:16.020]   The message that I have is a combination of the last three Sundays at my church.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.340]   So I didn't prepare the substance of this just for you.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.620]   But as I was praying three or four days ago, "Lord, what am I supposed to say in this situation?"
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.540]   And I went over in my mind what I had been trying to drive home to my people from the
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.420]   sixth chapter of John.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.940]   I think the Lord said, "Just go there and apply it to their situation."
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.860]   And here's the remarkable thing.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.140]   I hope you see this.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:06:00.580]   There is a sense in which your position here in prison, next stop heaven, makes it easier
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:09.700]   for you to get this message than for my people who are tempted every day to be idolaters
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.980]   with their freedom and their prosperity.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.220]   Let me sum it up.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.580]   Let's do the big summary of where I'm going, and then we're going to go in.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.940]   And if you have a Bible and you want to go with me, you can go to John, the gospel of
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.180]   John chapter 6.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.740]   If you don't have a Bible, just listen.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.740]   That's fine.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.340]   And here's the summary of where we're going to go.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.500]   We're going to work on verses 1 through 29 in three sections because there were originally
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   three sermons.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.060]   We're packing it in to one, and I'll just get right to the heart of each one.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.020]   And there's a common denominator.
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.660]   Here's the main point.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.860]   Jesus did not come into the world mainly to give bread, but to be bread.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.860]   I am the bread of life.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.140]   He who comes to me will not hunger.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.300]   He who believes in me will never thirst.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.460]   John 6, 35.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460]   That's verse 35.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.940]   It says the same thing again in verse 48.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.700]   Same thing again in verse 51.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.620]   He came into the world not to give bread, but to be bread.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.100]   Now, he is going to give bread, and you can miss it.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.220]   You can miss it by thinking that's the main thing he came to do.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.260]   Give me the bread.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.940]   But that's not the main reason he came.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.180]   You've already had a lot of bread taken out of your hands, and I hope it lands on you
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:42.460]   with massive good news that he came to be bread, not mainly give bread.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:49.180]   He's got to take bread out of a lot of people's hands so that they will trust him as the bread.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.660]   Secondly, he did not come to be useful, but to be precious.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:04.140]   Oh, how many Christians receive him as useful.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:13.380]   Or another way to put it is Jesus Christ did not come into the world to assist you in meeting
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.620]   desires you already had before you were born again.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:26.820]   He came into the world to change your desires so that he's the main one.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.420]   That's the reason he came.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:34.700]   And so many preachers, maybe some have stood in this pulpit, and they have taken you right
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:41.720]   where you are with your desires, natural desires that you share with every fallen human being
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.940]   in the world and just say, "Jesus came to meet that."
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.420]   Well, he didn't.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.220]   He came to change those desires profoundly deep.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.620]   It's called the new birth so that he's the central desire.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.140]   He's the bread.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.780]   He's the precious one.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.020]   That's the point of this sermon.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.420]   Now, he does care about bread.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.580]   I mean natural bread.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.580]   He cares about your body.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.980]   He just doesn't care about your body and your natural bread mainly.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.740]   That's coming.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.860]   That's coming just on the other side of the grave.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.380]   There's going to be a resurrection someday.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:33.020]   No more mourning, no more crying, no more tears, no more depression, no more sin, only
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.260]   joy on the new earth, under the new heavens forever.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.260]   That's coming.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.940]   He cares about the body.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:45.380]   He's going to raise the body from the dead, make you young forever, handsome forever,
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:51.780]   healthy forever so that you can enjoy him in the fullness of your humanity.
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.780]   That's coming.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.060]   But that's not the main point of this world.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.060]   Amen.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.220]   It's unclear what resulted from Piper's meeting with Gerald Borderland and this sermon,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.060]   One Day We Will Know.
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.220]   Piper promised to write and he did, sending off two letters in December of 2009.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.580]   "I know that you have decided not to appeal your death sentence.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.140]   You have decided to lay down your life to spare your family and others any more heartache,"
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.140]   Piper wrote him.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.660]   "I see a glimmer of goodness in that.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.260]   Maybe you can taste, then, what it was like for Jesus.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.060]   He never committed any sin, none, not even a bad thought or a bad attitude.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:34.320]   If anybody ever deserved to live a long life, it was Jesus, and it ended at age 33.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.420]   It ended because he chose to die in our place so that the curse of our sin could fall on
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.420]   him.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.580]   As I said, no one takes my life from me.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.300]   I lay it down of my own accord.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.700]   So he chose to die for us.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.940]   Gerald, you know that you have committed many sins, including the one that will send you
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.840]   to your death in this world.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.260]   But there is no sin so great that the terrible death of Jesus cannot cover it.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.340]   I hope you believe this."
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.140]   Seven weeks after this sermon, Borderland was executed.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.020]   On January 7, 2010, he was led into Angola's lethal injection chamber, wearing a white
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.220]   t-shirt and a gold-crossed necklace from his daughter.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.860]   Witnesses say Borderland's eyes were red-rimmed from crying as he haltingly said his final
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:25.460]   words, "I'd like to apologize to my family and tell them that I love them."
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.700]   He was strapped down, IVs inserted in his arms.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.380]   Three drugs put him to sleep, stopped his breathing, and stopped his heart, all very
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380]   quickly.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.500]   A moment later, Warden Kane said, "We now pronounce Gerald Borderland dead.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.300]   We've sent his soul for final judgment."
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.720]   To this day, Borderland remains the last prisoner to be executed in Louisiana.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.340]   You can listen to or watch the full sermon at DesireWinGod.org titled, "Jesus Came
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.300]   Not to Give Bread, But to Be Bread."

[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.780]   I'm your host Tony Ranke, and we'll see you on Friday with Pastor John, back in the
