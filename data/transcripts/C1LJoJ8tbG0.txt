[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.240]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the seventh chapter, reading verses 37 and 38.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.640]   Verses 37 and 38 in the seventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.200]   This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.440]   "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:38.200]   Him shall ye hear." This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.920]   spake to him in the Mount Sinai and with our fathers, who received the lively oracles to give
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.440]   unto us. I want in particular to deal again with that last statement in this account which is given
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.360]   here by the first Christian martyr Stephen of this great man Moses. And the thing he tells
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   them about him was that amongst these other things he received the lively or the living
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:23.520]   oracles from God to give unto us. Now it's very important we should bear in mind the context of
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.840]   this statement. This is a part of this great speech that was delivered by this man Stephen,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.400]   who was as I say the first Christian martyr. He was on trial, he'd been arrested, and here he is
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.200]   standing before the great court at Jerusalem, the Sanhedrin. And they bring very serious charges
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.640]   against him, they charge him with blasphemy. But he's given an opportunity to defend himself.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.160]   The high priest, we are told in the first verse, said to him, "Are these things so?" So Stephen
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:07.080]   takes the opportunity and delivers an address to this august assembly of judges. And what he does,
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.720]   as we've been seeing for many many Sunday nights, is to give a review, a brief review,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.200]   of the long history of the children of Israel. Now he doesn't do that merely to remind them of
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.680]   facts with which they were familiar, he doesn't do it still less to entertain them. He's got a
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.760]   plan in his mind, he's got a scheme in his mind. These men are trying him because he's a Christian,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.480]   because he believes that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and the only Savior of mankind.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.520]   That's been made abundantly clear, not only by Stephen, but by the apostles and the other
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.240]   Christians, amongst whom he was just one individual. He'd been made a deacon, he had
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.880]   certain functions to perform in the church, but he was also teaching. And they all said the same
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.640]   thing. They preached Jesus and the resurrection. They said Jesus is the Son of God. And they said
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.800]   quite specifically, that there is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.000]   saved. That was their teaching and their preaching. And it was because he believed and taught things
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.840]   like that, that this man Stephen is here to be found standing on trial for his life, before the
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.680]   members of the Sanhedrin. Now then, why does he recapitulate this history? It's quite simple.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.720]   There's a very wonderful plan in this address. What he's showing them is this, that though they're
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.280]   so proud of their history and certain of their institutions like the temple and so on, they've
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.720]   never really understood their meaning. They've never understood the real meaning of their own
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.120]   history. They're very proud of Abraham, but they've really missed the whole point about Abraham.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   Abraham rejoiced to see my day, said the Jesus whom they had rejected. So obviously they've
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   completely misunderstood Abraham. Then he takes up the case of Joseph and shows what a wonderful
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:20.760]   prototype Joseph was, how he was treated by his brethren exactly as they and others had treated
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.040]   the Son of God. The same misunderstanding. And then he comes to this third great case,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.320]   the case of Moses, to which he devotes more attention than to any one of the others,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.640]   and that for very obvious reasons. The charges that were brought against Stephen are enumerated
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.720]   at the end of the previous chapter, and they're these. They summoned men which said we have heard
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.400]   him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God. They also set up false witnesses
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.040]   which said this man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.160]   the temple, and the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.560]   this place and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. Now, you see, this was the
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.840]   essence of the charge that they brought against him, that he's putting Moses on one side,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.520]   he's putting the temple on one side, he's putting the law of God on one side. That he's putting God
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.800]   himself on one side. He's speaking blasphemous words, they say, against God. Now then that being
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.080]   the charge that is brought against him, it is not surprising that Stephen should devote considerable
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.600]   attention to the case of Moses. It suits his purpose very well, for Stephen, you know,
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.200]   was not merely defending himself. He really was acting as an evangelist at the same time.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.280]   He doesn't merely want to beat these people in an argument, in a discussion. He wants to enlighten
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.240]   them. He treats them as our Lord treated the Pharisees and the scribes, that's what these
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.800]   people were some of them. He treats them as our Lord treated Judas to the very end. He's pleading
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.160]   with their souls, in a sense. He wants them to see the error, the grievous error of what they're
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.680]   doing in their rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he shows them that what really lies at the
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.000]   back of the rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ and his great salvation is a complete failure
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.320]   to understand their own history. To understand Moses, to understand the law, to understand the
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.960]   temple and everything that happened in it. Now this is the astounding thing about these members
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.760]   of the Sanhedrin, as it was true of course of the majority of the Jewish people. It is the
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:00.440]   tragedy of the ages, that they had completely misunderstood the meaning of the things of which
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:07.880]   they were so proud. That is the essence of their tragedy. They were proud of these things. Moses,
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:15.320]   the temple, the ceremonial, all these things, the law, and above all of course God. They were
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:23.840]   God's people. And yet Stephen is easily able to show them that they have misinterpreted and
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:32.440]   misunderstood every single one of these very things in which they made their best. And that's
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.200]   what he's doing at this particular point. He first of all tells them the story of Moses, reminds them
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.240]   of the actual facts, and how their own fellow countrymen, their own forefathers, have rejected
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:51.440]   Moses at first, and have prolonged their misery by 40 years in their blindness and dullness. And
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.760]   oh then Moses miraculously, at the command of God, had led them out and had brought them to the land
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.680]   of Canaan. And then having stated the facts, he sums it up here. Now he says, "This is that Moses
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.360]   which said unto the children of Israel, 'A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.560]   brethren, like unto me. Him shall he hear.' Moses prophesied the coming of the Son of God. This is
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.720]   he, this is the man that was in the church at the gathering of God's people in the wilderness. And
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.840]   while he was doing that as their leader, there were two things that were outstanding in his story.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:33.800]   The first is that he was with the angel which spake to him in the Mount Sinai. When he was up
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   on the mount, you remember, and receiving the law. And he mentions that. "Who received the living
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:49.320]   oracles to give them to us." Moses was the man between God and the people. He goes up to represent
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.640]   them. He receives the message and he delivers it to them. Now then, what is Stephen saying? Well
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.880]   what he's saying you see, is this. He says, "The key to the understanding of Moses and of your own
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:12.480]   nation is to realize that they were what they were because they have received the Word of God." The
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.920]   Jews were unique. Moses was a unique man. But what explains it? Why were they so unique? The answer
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:28.080]   is, they have received the Word of the living God. The lively, the living oracles of God. It's the
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.560]   only way to understand their history. The other nations excelled them in military prowess and
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.800]   might and power, and the Greeks in philosophy, and many others. Egypt with all its learning and its
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:45.680]   law, and yet here is this little people that have meant so much to the whole history of the human
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:53.720]   race. There's only one explanation. They have received this Word of God. It's the special thing
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.360]   about them. Paul constantly points that out, and particularly in Romans 9, as I was reminding you a
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   fortnight ago. Well now, you see he uses this to show them that they're rejecting this self-same
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.520]   word. In other words, Stephen's point is this. Nothing is more important in this life and in
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:25.040]   this world than to recognize and to receive and to submit to the Word of the living God. Now,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:32.080]   that's the reason why I'm calling your attention to it. As Stephen, I say, was not concerned merely
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:39.040]   to interest these people or to take them over the history for the sake of doing so and indulge in
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.120]   some sort of antiquarian inquiry. Oh, I'm not holding this old story of Stephen and the Sun
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.640]   Hedron before you with any motive such as that. I've only one reason for holding it before you.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.760]   My dear friends, Stephen was able to show that these people were repeating the old error of
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.080]   the Jews, and I'm here to say that mankind that rejects Christ tonight is repeating the old error
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:09.880]   of the Sun Hedron. It's exactly the same thing, and this is the most important thing in the world.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:19.000]   It is still true to say that what makes a difference, the difference to a man, an individual,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:28.880]   or to a nation, is the relationship to this Word. It's as true tonight as it has been true
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.960]   throughout the running centuries. What differentiates the Christian from all others is
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.120]   that he has received this Word and has submitted himself to it. The others have rejected it.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   But it isn't merely a question of receiving or rejecting a Word. It is what depends upon all
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.080]   this. That's what makes it so urgently important. That is why I stand in this pulpit and preach
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.480]   this gospel to you. It is the only hope for mankind tonight. Everything else is failing,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.000]   round and about us. This is the only thing that can save, and this is the tragedy,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.480]   that the modern man is repeating the error of the Sun Hedron as they were repeating the
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.280]   errors of their forefathers. What a tragedy this is! Or let me put it in another way to you.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:26.440]   Would you like to live in this world as Moses did, or as Abraham had done before him,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:33.320]   or as Joseph had done, or any one of these great heroes and giants of the faith? What men they
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   were! They were in this same old world that you and I are living in. They were subjected to the
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.080]   same stresses and trials. Don't let's be foolish enough to think that because they
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.080]   hadn't got jet aeroplanes that there were no stresses. Of course there were. Life has always
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.960]   been difficult and trying. Life has always been a fight. And these men were of like passions with
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.520]   ourselves. They had the same frailties, the same weaknesses. The world, the flesh, and the devil
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:08.120]   were there against them. And yet they stand out as giants, great big men, heroes, men who mastered
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:17.960]   life and went through it and out of it triumphantly and gloriously. Would you be like that? Would you
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:24.680]   like to live as they live? Would you like deliverance from your problems and from the things
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:31.240]   that get you down? Well there's only one answer to it. You've got to listen to, you've got to
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.920]   believe, you've got to accept, you've got to submit to this very word. Now then, that's why we're
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:43.040]   examining it. And you see, this is the key to the whole of Christianity. What is Christianity? It is
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:53.840]   this word. It is God's word to men. The living word of God, these living oracles. This has been
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.440]   the key right through. The whole of the Bible is the living oracles of God. It's the living word
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:09.400]   of God, the whole of it. And the way to discover this blessed salvation is to pay attention to,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.560]   and to listen to, and to receive this word. Now then, what have we seen? What we've seen is this.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:24.960]   Christianity, unlike every other teaching offering itself to mankind tonight, is a matter of revelation.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:34.760]   That's a fundamental thing. Moses received the living oracles. He didn't go up onto the mountain
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:41.000]   to do research work, or to spend time thinking with a towel around his head as it were, in order
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.640]   to work out a philosophy. Nothing of the sort. Philosophy is the greatest enemy of the Christian
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.280]   faith, because it depends entirely upon the ability of men. And Christianity is the exact
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.400]   opposite. It is God speaking, God giving the revelation, God giving the knowledge of the
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.160]   information and the truth. It is all from God. Nothing of men's discovery at all. That's the
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:16.120]   basic thing. But then we've gone on beyond that to look at this word, "lively," living. And this
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:23.920]   again is of tremendous importance. It's unlike every other word. The words of men don't live.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.120]   This is the only word that's ever been alive and is still alive, and it goes on. The word
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:36.480]   of God that "liveth and abideth forever." It'll never stop. Let the world produce its inventions.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.960]   Let us change everything. Let's make a new society. Let the politicians do all they can.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:49.800]   I tell you that still this word will still be going, and will be the only thing that can bless
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:16:01.280]   men. "It abideth forever." And it's a powerful word. The word of God is quick and powerful. What
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:09.880]   a word. The word of creation, the word of the flood, the word, "He spake and it was done." A
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:19.880]   mighty word. The word of miracles. It's a word of power. But it's a very searching word. Here's
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   the word that searches us. Psychology doesn't know what searching is when you put it by the side of
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:32.080]   this. It's simply playing on the surface. But here's a word that goes down, dividing even asunder
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:38.760]   the soul and spirit and the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.280]   heart. There's nothing that's hidden from this. All things are naked and open unto the eyes of
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:52.000]   him with whom we have to do. Here's a word that gets rid of all hypocrisy and sham and pretense.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.680]   You can't get away from it. You can answer the words of men. You know that they're as bad as you
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:02.000]   are. And you know that there's dishonesty. But here's a word that fixes you and examines you
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.360]   and exposes you to yourself. And you can't wriggle out of it. It's the only word that does that. It's
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:13.240]   the only word that tells us the truth about ourselves. And finally, it's a word that confronts
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:23.440]   us with the only two great eternal possibilities. You are either for God or else you're against him.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.920]   And a better way of putting that is this. You've either submitted yourself to God or you're under
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.280]   his wrath. And there's no other possibility. It's one or the other. It's the only distinction that
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:42.760]   matters in the world tonight. Very well. Now there, you see, the living oracles. But what's
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.400]   the message of these words? Those are general characteristics. But what does this word actually
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.000]   say to us? Well, that's the thing we want to consider this evening. Moses, says Stephen,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.560]   was up in the mountain. He received the living oracles to give unto us. And he did so. Now,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.480]   Stephen, of course, is particularly concerned about the law that was given by God to Moses
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.320]   on the mount. But also, I believe, is included here, everything that was given to Moses that
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.960]   enabled him to write the first five books of the Bible, the books of Moses. That's all a part of
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.600]   the same revelation. Not only the Ten Commandments, but the whole revelation that God gave to Moses.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:30.640]   It's all included. But you see, the case of the Bible is this. That there's only one incident
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:37.000]   in the giving of this word of God. The whole Bible is the word of God. The prophets have the same
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   word given to them. In a sense, they were nothing but expositors of the law that was given to Moses.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.600]   They worked it out. They applied it to their own time and generation. But it was all the same
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:54.360]   eternal word of God. The word of God came to so and so. And then it came to John the Baptist in
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:00.600]   the wilderness. And it came to the Son of God himself, who said, "The words that I speak unto
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:08.280]   you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that sent me, he gave me the word." And the apostles,
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.120]   what are they doing? Are they just giving us the result of their own meditations and thoughts and
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   reasoning? Not at all. Revelation, dispensation of the gospel, has been granted unto me, says Paul.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:30.760]   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord. The given word. The word of God. We are
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:38.240]   nothing, says Paul, but heralds, guardians, custodians of the faith. Stewards of the mysteries.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:46.440]   Not the words of men. We are but the stewards of this mysterious word of God. Very well. So it's
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:56.760]   the same, you see. The whole Bible is the word of God. We divide it into Old Testament and New. And
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.440]   there are many people I find, and even some Christians, who are rather surprised that we
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.760]   still use the Old Testament. As there may be some listening to me now, surprised that I'm repeating
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.720]   these words of Stephen, a man who died in the first century. They say, "What's that got to do
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.440]   with us?" Now if you say that, you show you've missed the whole point. The word of God is the
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:22.160]   same word always. It's the eternal word. The word of God, to Abraham is as applicable to us
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:30.320]   tonight as it was to Abraham. It's always the same word. It doesn't change. So you take your whole
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:37.680]   Bible. Is there any relationship between the Old and the New? Well there is, of course, because
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:44.640]   it's all the word of God. And the way you look at it is this. The Old Testament is a book that
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:53.880]   prophesies and prepares for and leads to the New Testament. They're different and yet they're the
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:00.080]   same. So the word that was given to Moses, and this is the whole point made by Stephen, the word
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.640]   that was given by Moses was a word that was pointing to this Jesus whom you members of the
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.360]   Sanhedrin have rejected. That's what he's saying. So he's covering the whole of the Old Testament,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:21.000]   and rightly so. Very well, I want to show you its message. What is this message that you and I and
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.920]   all mankind stands in need of? What is this word of God? What's it got to say to us? Here we are
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:38.600]   in our troubled modern world. We know all about that, don't we? And you're here to listen for
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:45.440]   something unique and exceptional because it is the word of God. What is it? What's it tell us?
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.840]   What's its content? Here's the answer. Moses received it, delivered it, passed it on to us.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.400]   What's it about? Well, let me give you a summary of it. I read to you at the beginning the Ten
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.440]   Commandments as they're recorded in the 20th chapter of the book of Exodus in order that you
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   might be reminded. That's just a summary of this great word of God. What's it about? What is it
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:18.200]   that man needs to know tonight? Why have you come here? Why did you come? You're doing something
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.680]   unusual. The vast majority of the people in this country don't do this sort of thing now. Why are
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:31.920]   you here? I know why you're here. We're all here for the same reason. We are here because in
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:40.160]   various ways we're in trouble. We are here because we are unhappy in certain respects. We are here
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.640]   because we are aware of failure. We are aware of weakness. We are aware of shame. We are aware of
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:54.680]   fear. We don't like the thought of death. We wonder what happens beyond it. There's an uncertainty.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   That's why we're here. Nobody listens to this word unless he's some way or another being conscious
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.000]   of some need. Nobody takes the trouble to do this these days. People scoff at it. But you will hear,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.680]   well, you're right. But the question is, what do you need to hear? Do you need to hear a political
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.600]   word? Well, it's certain that you don't. You're hearing plenty of that and it doesn't solve your
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.840]   problems. Do you want a psychological word? Well, there's been any amount of that, but it doesn't
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.400]   help you, does it? And all the other words that the world is offering, they don't help us. They
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.760]   don't touch us. Why not? Well, they all make a fatal mistake. They start at the wrong point.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:46.440]   They all start with us as if we mattered first and foremost. And then they offer us some panacea.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.040]   It doesn't help us. It doesn't satisfy us. They're all wrong. They start in the wrong way.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   What is this word of God? What's the content? What's the message? Well, here it is. It starts
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:10.480]   with God. With God. We can't repeat this too frequently. The thing that differentiated the
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:19.320]   children of Israel from all the other nations was that they were the people of God. That God
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:25.440]   had spoken to them. He hadn't spoken to the other nations, but he had spoken to them. He had created
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.760]   them as a nation in order that he might speak to them, that he might give to them these living
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.280]   oracles. That's the point made by Paul at the beginning of the third chapter of his epistle to
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.800]   the Romans and at the beginning of the ninth chapter of the same epistle. God had given them
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:46.760]   these living oracles. They've got this word of God. What's it about? Well, it's about God. This
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.480]   is the thing that marks them off as a people, and Moses included, from all the other nations.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:00.880]   How did he do it? Well, he did it like this. The other nations had what they called their gods.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:10.960]   They made their idols out of wood or gold or silver, precious metals. They called their gods.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.360]   Then they built temples for them, and then they worshipped them. And then they had other gods,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:25.600]   sun, moon, stars. Some were spiritists, animists, believing in spirits in trees and stones and
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.560]   things like that. Well, you remember that was the characteristic of the other nations. But
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:40.440]   their gods, as the Bible of the Old Testament particularly points out, they were dead. That
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.840]   was the whole difficulty of them. You remember the sublime sarcasm of some of the Psalms. The
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:50.000]   psalmist asks these pagans to look at their gods, and he asks the children of Israel to look at the
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.880]   gods that they in their folly were turning to, having turned their backs upon the God of Israel.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.840]   They said, "Look at your gods. They have eyes, but they can't see. They have hands, but they can't
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.960]   do anything with them. They've got feet, but they can't walk. They're dead. There's nothing there.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:11.720]   You've made them yourselves, and they can't even move themselves. You have to move them. They are
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:18.160]   your gods, they say, and you're mad enough to be worshipping dumb, dead, lifeless idols."
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:28.440]   Well, the children of Israel presented an amazing contrast to that. Likewise, you can take the world
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:34.800]   outside God, at its best and highest. You take your Greek philosophers. Ah, they were learned men.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.120]   They were seeking for God. They were aware of the problem of life, and they had a feeling there was
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.080]   someone at the back and someone beyond it all, but they couldn't find him. No, they couldn't.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:50.560]   Temple to the unknown God. You see, there was nothing there. You've got nothing but their
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.640]   thoughts. They were brilliant thinkers. There's no need to detract from the greatness of the
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.600]   Greek philosophers in order to preach Christ. We only do that when people put their faith in Greek
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.880]   philosophy rather than in Christ, and then we show them what fools they are. But Greek philosophy,
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:13.040]   at its best, is only human endeavor, and it doesn't get there. Their gods were dead and
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:23.720]   they were lifeless. But the children of Israel knew about a living God. The God who'd created
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:31.120]   the whole universe. The God of history. The God who acts, the God who intervenes in men's lives
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:39.800]   and in the lives of nations. Not a damaido, not something lifeless, not something inanimate,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:47.080]   but the living God. Oh, let me put this, to leave it in one great picture. You see it in one picture
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.680]   on a mountain called Carmel, and there was a great competition, a great contest. There was
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:28:00.880]   the representative of God, a prophet called Elijah. And opposing him, there were 850 false
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:09.000]   prophets. 400 belonging to one section, 450 to another. Add them together, 850 against one man,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.320]   Elijah. And they claimed that their gods were the real gods, and they'd persuaded the foolish
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.440]   children of Israel to go after their gods, and to turn their backs upon and to forsake the God of
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.920]   Israel. And the great testing moment comes. Which of them is right? Very well, says Elijah,
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.680]   the servant of the living God. We'll easily test this. And this was the method he adopted,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.880]   you remember. He said, now let's go on to this mountain. You build an altar and I'll build an
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:41.040]   altar. Then you'll kill an ox and I'll kill an ox. And you'll cut him up into pieces and so will I.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:47.200]   Then we'll get a wooden sticks and so on, and you'll pile them up together to make a fire,
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:54.160]   and I'll do the same. Then we'll put the pieces of the ox on top of the wood and all that you've
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:01.920]   prepared, and I'll do the same. Then he said, this will be the test. You pray to your gods to
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:08.560]   send down fire from heaven to consume that offering, and I'll do the same. And the God
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:16.720]   that answereth by fire, let him be the God. And they did it. And the story is told in the first
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:23.240]   book of Kings chapter 18, the 800 and 50. They had the first chance. Elijah said, you go first.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.880]   And he gave them the opportunity, and they began. And they put everything in position,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:33.200]   and they began to pray. Nothing happened. Here they are about midday, and Elijah comes and laughs
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.480]   at them and says, what's the matter? He says, why haven't your gods heard you? Then he says,
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.160]   with his delightful divine sarcasm, perhaps he's asleep. You're not shouting enough. Perhaps he's
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.440]   gone on a journey. Perhaps he can't hear you. Look here, shout a little more, said Elijah. He must
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.280]   be there, of course. You've said he is, and he's wonderful. Shout. Why doesn't he answer you? And
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.960]   they screeched and shouted and cut themselves with knives and lances. Nothing happened. Why not?
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:07.680]   Because there was nothing there. Nothing there. Dead gods. Idols. Nothing. Vacuity. Emptiness.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:15.440]   And then Elijah, you remember, he turns to his, and he gets them to pour water on top of the wood
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.800]   in the sacrifice in his case. They poured on so much water that there was a kind of trench,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:27.680]   a moat of water round about the altar. And then quietly he prays to God. And he says,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.880]   let it be known in Israel that thou art God, Lord God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   Let it be known this day in Israel that thou art God, O God, hear me. And God did hear him.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:50.440]   And the fire fell and consumed the offering and licked up the water that was in the trench.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   The God that answers by fire, who alone is the living God. He honored his servant. He manifested
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:04.200]   himself. And oh, read your Old Testament, my dear friend. You must start with God and you'll learn
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.240]   about God in the Old Testament. This God that makes a nation out of one man, that delivers
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.280]   them from their enemies, the God of the miracles. This is history. Sheer, solid history. Read it,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:22.080]   and you can't explain it except on one supposition, that he is the living God. A God who can hear and
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.960]   answer prayer. A God who can do things for you. A God who can change your life and give you a new
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   nature and make a new man of you and give you new strength and power. The living God. But because he
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:46.440]   is the living God, he is also the only God. And he emphasizes that in the Ten Commandments,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:54.160]   doesn't he? Don't you make any other gods, he says. Don't you bow down to any other gods. Don't
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:00.040]   put me in the same category as your lies. And this is what the modern world needs to know. The modern
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:06.640]   world is full of idolatry. Mankind is worshipping gods tonight. They don't actually make them always
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.760]   now, of wood and precious metals. Well, I shouldn't even say that because they do make motorcars,
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:20.920]   don't they? And they worship them. That's one of the modern idols, motorcar. They worship themselves.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.960]   They worship human ability. They worship these people we can send up into outer space. Marvellous
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.600]   worship science. As if science were a god. As if there were being there. As if there were life. As
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.720]   if there were understanding. No, no. It's men. It's nothing but men. Men's thoughts, projected,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.840]   systematized. That's what it is. But people are worshipping these things. They ridicule the worship
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.960]   of God as those people have done under the influence of the 850 false prophets. The world
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:59.600]   is doing all this tonight. It's worshipping false gods. But at the time of the moment of crisis and
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.920]   of need, their gods are silent. They can't help them. And that's why the world is crumbling visibly
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:14.400]   before us morally and in every other respect. The gods of the modern men are useless. And they fail
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:24.280]   us just when we need them most of all. Oh, the living God. The only God. The only true and living
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:38.680]   God. And what of his character? He is a holy God. He has said, "Be ye holy, for I am holy." God is
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:48.080]   light and in him is no darkness at all. Oh, what a contrast with the gods of men. Oh, what a
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:55.680]   contrast with men himself. A God of righteousness. A God of justice. A God of truth. A God of
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:03.360]   holiness. You can't understand God. We can't define God. All we know is that he has revealed
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:12.000]   these certain attributes of his, these things about himself. God is glory. He's beyond description.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.880]   But this is what he has been pleased to reveal to us concerning himself. And if the way I find so
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:28.680]   helpful trying to think about God and the being and the nature of God is this. God is the eternal
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:37.400]   opposite of what you and I know so well in this world. What do we know? Well, what we know is
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:51.320]   selfishness, self-interest. What we know is lying, not truth. Pretense and sham. Not eternal rightness.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:35:01.400]   What do we know? We know ugliness instead of ineffable beauty and brightness and whiteness
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:13.520]   and holiness. What do we know? Lust, passion, desire. Inconceivable. In the God who cannot
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.920]   lie. The God who is of such pure countenance that he cannot look upon sin. My friends,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.200]   what the world needs to know about everything else tonight is that God is and that he's like
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.640]   that and that he's all this world. He's made it, he's brought it into being and he holds it and
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:38.720]   sustains it in his hand. And then the other thing he's revealed about himself is this. That he
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:48.080]   demands worship from us. Thou shalt not bow down unto any graveny man. Thou shalt have no other
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:55.120]   gods beside me. This is what God is saying to the modern world. The modern world that's worshiping
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:01.280]   education and culture and philosophy and science and knowledge and our marvelous advances. He's
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.800]   saying to such a world, you mustn't bow down to these things. These are the things that are going
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:15.920]   to destroy you and wreck your whole civilization. You must worship me and worship me alone. For I
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:24.840]   am God and there is none other and I will not give my glory to another. Now my friends, I am
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:33.320]   explaining to you why the world is as it is tonight. God says I am a jealous God. You see,
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:40.520]   whether you and I believe these things or not, it makes no difference. God is and he is a jealous
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:46.680]   God and he won't suffer this. He won't suffer us to put any gods by his side. No, no, he'll smash
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:52.960]   them. You put a God by the side of God, he'll smash him as he smashed Dagon of Urg. And that's
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.360]   what he's doing in this modern world. Look at this foolish 20th century to which you and I belong. We
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:05.640]   made ourselves new gods. It began a hundred years ago in the Victorian era. The German philosophy,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.240]   masquerading in the form of what was called higher criticism of the scripture. God being put on one
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:17.240]   side, revelation being thrown aside. Philosophy, man's understanding, the worship of scholarship,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:24.000]   man's capacity to make a new world. Shame on our grandfathers who began worshipping politicians.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.960]   Often happened in this pulpit. Before the First World War, they used to borrow this place and
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:36.480]   the great day was the day the politicians came and addressed Christian assemblies as if they
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:42.160]   could show us the way. We've read their biographies since then and the autobiographies of some of them
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:48.640]   and we've seen that they were gods with feet of clay. They were never gods, but in our folly we
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:54.900]   worship these people and we believe that this was the way to bring in the new Jerusalem. Rubbish
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:02.460]   nonsense. And you see how God has ridiculed it. In two world wars he's smashed our gods before our
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:08.200]   eyes. He's made them look silly and ridiculous and he's still doing it. And as long as mankind
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:15.240]   in its folly goes on making its gods and bowing down to them, he'll smash them. Do what you like
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:21.280]   with your civilization. Organize to perfection. It'll never work, it cannot. God will not tolerate
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:31.000]   it. He's a jealous God. And a man or a nation or a world that bows down to any other God is going to
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.280]   be humbled, punished, ridiculed. He's the judge eternal. And he has made it perfectly clear that
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:43.760]   he will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:51.440]   them that hate him. And if you have any insight into the cause and the meaning of history, you
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:58.400]   will see that that has been happening through the running centuries. That's precisely what has been
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:05.160]   happening. It's a terrible thing to try to define this living God. You'll suffer for it. Nations
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:12.560]   have suffered, as individuals have suffered. But God has said it all. He's revealed it. This is
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:18.400]   what he said in those lively living oracles that he gave to Moses to deliver to the children of
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:28.800]   Israel. This is the essence of his law. It's about God himself. But he doesn't stop with God, of
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   course. He also tells us about men. And it's an astonishing thing, you know, that we need to be
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:45.760]   told this quite as much. This is where the modern man shows his unutterable folly. He worships
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:54.600]   himself. But he's like the members of the Sanhedrin. He doesn't understand men. They, you see, as I say,
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:02.640]   were glorying in Abram, Joseph, Moses, the temple, the fathers, the word of God. They said, "We've
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.840]   got it, the law." They were glorying in the fact that they had the law when nobody else did. But
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:12.560]   the whole time, they've misunderstood it completely. And that's what the modern man is doing with
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:20.000]   regard to himself. He puts himself on a pedestal and he worships himself. Modern man is worshipping
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.160]   a man. But this is the whole tragedy. He doesn't know what man is. He's worshipping an idol. He
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   doesn't know the nature of himself, of men, as he is. And you know, you never know what man is until
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:43.360]   you accept his word. This is the only word that tells us the truth about man, as well as about
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.840]   God. You are familiar with the modern ideas of man. Of course, there are many theories. They don't
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.440]   all agree. They're disagreed tremendously amongst one another. There's the purely biological view
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.600]   of men. All right, we needn't waste time with that. Men's just the result of his ductless glen.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.760]   And as I've often pointed to, they actually say, I'm not saying this, I'm repeating what they say.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.880]   You can easily explain Shakespeare, Beethoven, Napoleon, purely in terms of ductless glens. No
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:16.760]   more to it than that. The biological view of men. Then, of course, there is the economic view of
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:25.160]   men. This has been very popular in this century. Men as an economic unit. Men is just the resultant
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:30.000]   of the interplay of economic forces, the result of supply and demand. Everything's explained like
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   that. The whole of history, everything else. I read a book recently by a man who tried to explain
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.200]   even Puritanism in terms like that. Well, that's, you see, the way they do it now. Men is just a
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:46.480]   kind of economic unit, economic men. And they've got various other views which they put before us
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:56.920]   of men. But my dear friends, they're all wrong. Is men just an animal? Now, here's the great question,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:03.360]   isn't it? This is the thing that's going to decide so many other things. Is men simply an animal? I
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:09.760]   know more highly developed than the others. The top flight, as it were. Of course, we haven't
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.720]   arrived yet at perfection. There's going to be something even better. But is that your view of
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:21.560]   men? That he is just an animal? That men is really nothing but body? He's got a brain, of course,
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.360]   as a part of his body. And that's highly developed, especially the cerebrum. And therefore, men is able
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:32.040]   to do things that certain other animals cannot. But essentially, he is an animal. Now, here is the
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:40.480]   most vital question. Are you concerned about your own failure, as I said? Are you troubled by this
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:47.720]   modern turning to drugs? Does it worry you? But the question is, why do people do that? What's
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   the matter? Why are we facing all these multiplying problems in every department and realm of life?
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:01.560]   Why the wars? What's the matter? Now, the first way to answer all these questions is this. Not
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.360]   to sign a resolution to send to President Johnson about bombing in Vietnam. That's what these
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:12.800]   religious gatherings that are starting tomorrow and are going on for a few weeks are certain to
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.160]   do. I'm not being a prophet in saying that. I'm just using a little common sense and observation
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.800]   from year to year. But they'll do it again. As if this is the message of Christianity. As if this
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:30.400]   is the word of God. No, no. We have got the only solution because we've got the only understanding
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:42.520]   of the problem. And it is an understanding of the nature of man. What is it? Well, it is that man is
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:55.320]   not just an animal. That man is a creature made in the image and likeness of God. That man is the
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:05.000]   Lord of creation, not a part of it. Not just the most highly developed section of it. He's distinct,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.600]   he's unique. He's God's representative. Was given the great privilege of naming the animals. That's
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:20.200]   man. That's something of God about him. A dignity, a greatness. He's got mind, he's got understanding,
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:26.280]   he's got a soul and spirit. He's meant for communion with God and the eternal and the unseen
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:32.440]   and the spiritual and the everlasting. That's man. That's how he was made, that he was meant to be.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:39.400]   God looked upon him and saw that it was good and it was perfect in the image and likeness of God.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:49.000]   If only the whole world knew that tonight. If only the whole world believed that. Oh,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.480]   what a transformation. What a difference it would make. Why are they living as they do?
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.720]   Because they hold the view of themselves that they do. If I'm just an animal, well then I
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.840]   should behave like an animal. If we're all animals in the farmyard, is it surprising that people are
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:10.360]   behaving like animals in the farmyard? Is it surprising that you've got infidelity and divorce
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.040]   and adultery and all the things prohibited in the Ten Commandments? It's not surprising. If man is
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:22.680]   just that well, why are you surprised that he behaves like that? But that's the philosophy.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.760]   And then you see you have to pass Acts of Parliament and you have to multiply your prisons
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.600]   and you've got to increase your civil service. The whole thing is becoming one bit of government.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:39.400]   Why? Well, because of the problems of men. And poor men, he's only doing what they say is the
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:43.600]   truth about him. They've told him that he's just an animal and now they're surprised and troubled
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   because he behaves as one. That's your world. And what the world needs, you see, is to listen to
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:59.840]   this Word of God. Man is man in the image and likeness of God and he's responsible to God.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:05.920]   And God has set him in this world and God is going to judge him and hold him responsible.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:13.080]   That's what this modern world needs to know. I'm not an expert in politics and none of your
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.480]   preachers are. Though they may have great titles in the Christian Church, they know no more than
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.680]   I do. But they talk and give their opinions about these matters. That's not the Word of God,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:30.760]   that's their opinion. Here's the Word of God. And if the Christian Church doesn't preach it,
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:37.400]   who's going to preach it? But I'm in this pulpit for one reason. Only I've received it. I know
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:43.320]   nothing apart from what I've got here open before me. I know nothing. I know nothing about myself,
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.080]   about men, but what I find here and what I see here is this, that you'll never understand man
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:58.240]   until you look at him in the context of God. And then you begin to understand him. The next thing
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:06.280]   is this, that God has revealed also how we should live. How are we to live? Well, you see, he's not
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:12.920]   left us in ignorance. I know the popular modern idea is, do good. Don't do certain things, do as
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:21.560]   much good as you can, and you're all right. Moral, ethical teaching. Poor Matthew Arnold.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:32.440]   What's religion? Morality touched with emotion. As if the Bible had never been put before him,
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:42.200]   as if God had never spoken. No, no. The life you and I are called upon to live is not a life that
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.960]   any man has stated or defined. It isn't just morality and ethics and decency and goodness
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:55.640]   and kindness and benevolence and, oh yes, protesting against obvious evil. That's not it.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.880]   Your Bertrand Russells can do that, and they're the leaders in doing that. And I say it's a shame
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:09.560]   and a disgrace to see men who claim the name of Christ following in his train and regarding him
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.680]   as their leader. The man who's already written a book to tell us why he's not a Christian.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:22.200]   Of course, he doesn't know. The man is blind, as any man who rejects the word of God is blind,
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:29.800]   and just fumbles and stumbles through life and eventually goes out in final hopelessness
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:35.720]   and despair and failure. No, no. If you want to know how to live, you've got to come to this
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:44.200]   word of God. What are the ten commandments? How is man to live in this world? Well, the Lord Jesus
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:50.760]   Christ summed it all up for us, didn't he? Here it is. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:59.960]   with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength." That is the first and
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:07.080]   the chiefest commandment. And the second is likened to it. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:13.720]   as thyself." It's all there, my friend. You see, you've got to start with God. If you want to help
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:20.360]   men, don't start with men. Start with God. If you want to help your fellow men, get yourself right
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.240]   first. If you've got a wrong view of yourself and a wrong view of him, how can you possibly help him?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.720]   You can't. That's what the world's been trying to do in this century, and it's a dismal failure.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:37.400]   If you want to help men, start with God. You love the Lord your God with the whole of your being,
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:44.760]   and then you love your neighbor as yourself. And they're trying to banish war, you see,
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.840]   without mentioning God. They're looking at their neighbor only. They're starting with the second
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.560]   commandment, foolishly imagining that they can fulfill that when they take no interest in the
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:58.840]   first. It just cannot be done. You see, I prophesied I'm old enough to say this sort of
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.640]   thing now. I spent many years before this last war saying that the League of Nations would be a
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:09.400]   complete failure, and it was. I say the same about the United Nations. Men will never solve this
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   problem. Never. Never. You've got to start with God, and until men are humble before God, they'll
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.600]   fight one another and clutch at one another's throats, because they set themselves up as gods,
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:26.200]   and gods are jealous. Now, now, ten commandments.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:37.800]   Are you worshipping God? Are you living to his glory and to his praise? He's made you in order
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:44.120]   that you might do that. That's why he ever gave you being and existence, not for yourself. You
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:49.960]   have no right to yourself. You belong to God, who made you, and was endowed you with the faculties
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:55.080]   he's given you. You weren't created them. You simply inherited them. You found you've got them,
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:51:02.120]   and he meant you to display his glory through the very gifts that he's given you,
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:07.320]   and it is because men doesn't do that that he's in trouble. That's why the world is as it is.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.800]   We say they're ours, and we're jealous of another, or they're jealous of us, and then we want more,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:16.520]   and he wants more fighting. It's inevitable. Whence come wars amongst you, even of your lusts,
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:23.320]   that war in your members, and so on. Well, there it is. You start with God, the first table of the
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:30.600]   law, worship of God and honouring him in all your ways, and then, because he knows us so well,
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.680]   the negative injunctions.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:41.960]   And if the world needs to hear anything more than anything else tonight, it's this, isn't it?
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:49.880]   Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:55.400]   My word, what a difference it would make if everybody observed that.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:01.800]   Act of Parliament after Act of Parliament to deal with this question.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:07.640]   The church setting up commissions to find a way out to the problem. Oh, the tragedy of it all.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.880]   Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:20.280]   Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:27.000]   thy neighbour's wife, or his servant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that belongs to your
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.120]   neighbour. My dear friend, can't you see it? If only the whole world lived like that tonight,
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.720]   most of the problems would be banished. They'd vanish into thin air,
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.360]   and you wouldn't need all this bother and resolutions, and Acts of Parliament,
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.720]   and all the rest of it. It would be unnecessary. All this has come in.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:49.880]   The powers that be are ordained of God. Why? Well, because of sin and failure to live in the
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.920]   way that God has commended men to live, and to conduct himself in this life.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:01.560]   I've got to finish. My time has gone. What am I trying to say to you? What I'm trying to say to
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:07.640]   you is this, that this is the content, the message of the Word of God. I've got to go on with it,
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.960]   God willing, next Sunday night. But haven't I told you enough to say this even now,
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.880]   that this is a word that obviously condemns us, every single one of us.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:26.840]   Have you lived to the glory of God, or to your own glory? Have you kept the Ten Commandments
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:33.320]   positively and negatively? You can read books on philosophy, it's all there.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:39.480]   As if you want us to obey those, but you can't, can you? Of course you can't.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:45.800]   And the Word of God tells you that. The law was never given in order that we might save
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:51.320]   ourselves by keeping it. It was to show us that we cannot keep it.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:59.240]   It's a word that condemns us and tells us that we're lost. It goes further. It tells us that
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:08.680]   we can do nothing about our salvation. But thank God, it doesn't leave us on the ground in failure,
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:15.000]   misery, and condemnation. This is that message which said unto the children of Israel,
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:23.800]   "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you out of your brethren like unto me."
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:33.800]   Him shall he hear. And when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son,
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:42.440]   made of a woman made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:48.680]   We're all condemned by this Word of God, but listen to the other side.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:57.240]   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ," it says, "and thou shalt be saved." God is not only holiness
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:06.840]   and justice and righteousness and truth. He's a God of love. God so loved the world, this world
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:14.920]   that's been exposed under his law. He loved that, so loved it, that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:23.240]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:31.720]   And this is his Word to you tonight. "Through the cross behold the crown."
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:42.840]   As you are conscious of failure, misery, guilt, condemnation, look up unto, believe
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:49.960]   on the Lord Jesus Christ. Believe this Word which tells you that what was happening when he died
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.920]   on the cross was that God had laid your sins upon him and punished him there and is offering you
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:00.680]   free pardon that you can be delivered immediately tonight without doing anything. Simply believe,
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:11.000]   only believe, and thou shalt see that Christ is all in all to thee. My dear friends,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.080]   don't be like the blind foolish members of the Sanhedrin addressed by Stephen.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:29.000]   Turn and believe on the only one who can save you in time and in eternity, Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.840]   the Son of God. Amen.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:39.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
