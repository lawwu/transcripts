[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680]   - Happy Monday and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.600]   Today I am, I'm gonna batch several questions together
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.840]   all on the same Bible text of Colossians 1:20,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.680]   different themes, but same text of Colossians 1:20.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.260]   Here's the first one from John,
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.240]   a listener to the podcast from Mullumbimby, Australia?
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   Mullumbimby?
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.920]   I'm sure I butchered that.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.840]   Somewhere in Australia, Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.240]   What does it mean that God reconciled to himself
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.840]   all things, whether in heaven or on earth,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.320]   and why did he need to reconcile all things to himself?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.120]   A listener named Ryan writes in,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.640]   Dear Pastor John, a friend of mine and I
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.160]   have been discussing Colossians 1:20
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.560]   and the reconciliation of all things in heaven and on earth
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.840]   making peace by the blood of the cross.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.760]   What does this mean for those who are not elect?
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.800]   Does Colossians 1:19-20 allude to a reconciliation
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.720]   for both elect and non-elect alike?
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   Many thanks from a longtime listener.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.040]   And a listener named Lake writes in,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.800]   Pastor John, I understand that the earth
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.320]   needs reconciliation, but what's in heaven
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.880]   needing reconciliation?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.720]   So also asks Vicky in Dayton, Ohio,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.840]   Pastor John, Colossians 1:20 seems to imply
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.500]   that not just earth, but also heaven
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.580]   has been reconciled to God.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.220]   The ladies in my Bible study group can't agree here.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.960]   Some think Paul means the general universe.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.320]   Others think he means the actual heavenly abode of God.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.920]   We are wondering which is correct.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   It would seem to me that when the devil originally sinned,
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.660]   he contaminated heaven.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.160]   Therefore, part of Christ's atonement
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.580]   also cleansed the heavenly sanctuary.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.520]   Maybe.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.680]   Is that consistent with scripture?
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.800]   So a lot of questions on Colossians 1:20.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.080]   - Yeah.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.160]   Well, let's get the text in front of us.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160]   This is Colossians 1, 19 and 20.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.040]   In Christ, all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   and through him to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.520]   whether on earth or in heaven,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.280]   making peace by the blood of his cross.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.760]   So the questions our listeners are raising
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.120]   revolve mainly around what it means that God,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.000]   through the ministry of the divine Christ,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.960]   will reconcile to himself all things.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.760]   The phrase all things raises the question of universalism
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.560]   for a lot of people.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.040]   That is, will every person, even the demons
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.320]   and Satan himself be reconciled to God?
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.720]   And there'll be no hell and there'll be no final judgment,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.640]   no final destruction of anyone.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.680]   That's the first question.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.080]   Second question is raised by the phrase,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.520]   whether on earth or in heaven,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.320]   what would it mean to speak of reconciling anything
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.600]   or anyone being in heaven?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   What in heaven needs reconciling?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.160]   And then the third question I hear would be,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   how does the blood of Jesus establish peace in heaven
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   and on earth?
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.580]   So let's take these one at a time.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.580]   First, through Christ, God reconciles all things to himself,
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.120]   whether in heaven or on earth.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.840]   Does that mean that there is a universal salvation
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   and that in the end, hell will not exist
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.960]   and that all unbelievers and all demons and Satan himself
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.560]   will be reconciled and saved?
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.680]   The first problem with that interpretation
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.000]   is that Paul himself, both in this letter of Colossians
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.200]   and elsewhere, teaches that there will be
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.960]   the final wrath of God that will last forever on people.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.080]   It's not even that they would be put out of existence,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.820]   called annihilationism.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.740]   For example, in Colossians 3, 5, and 6, he says,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.440]   "Put to death therefore what is earthly in you,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.240]   "sexual immorality, impurity, passion,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.640]   "evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.760]   "On account of these, the wrath of God is coming."
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.800]   Then if you ask, well, how long will that wrath last?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.320]   What will that experience be like?
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.180]   And he says in 2 Thessalonians 1, 9,
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.220]   "Those who do not obey the gospel
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.540]   "will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.920]   "away from the presence of the Lord
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.400]   "and from the glory of his might."
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.360]   And if we look for confirmation
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.160]   that we're on the right track here in understanding Paul,
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.800]   we find in the teachings of John
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.320]   and the teachings of Jesus the same kind of thing.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.580]   For example, in Matthew 25, 46, Jesus says,
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.760]   "And these will go away into eternal punishment,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   "but the righteous into eternal life."
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.120]   And since eternal life is parallel with eternal punishment,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.400]   then it seems clear that the eternal punishment
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.240]   will have the same duration as the eternal life.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   And then in Revelation 14, 11,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.640]   John uses the strongest phrase possible in Greek
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.160]   to express eternity.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.100]   He says, "The smoke of their torment goes up
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.980]   "forever and ever."
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.560]   The Greek phrase behind that,
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.060]   forever and ever is as strong as it can be.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.120]   So we're talking everlasting duration of wrath.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.300]   And therefore, the problem with thinking that Colossians 1, 20
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.200]   is teaching that all things will be reconciled
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   and thus saved with no hell, no eternal punishment,
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.360]   no unbelievers or demons in existence.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.400]   Paul says that's just not true.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.240]   And so the question then, well, what does it mean?
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   If it can't mean that, universalism or annihilationism,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.120]   well then what does it mean?
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.440]   Through him to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.500]   whether on earth or in heaven.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.880]   So I would say to our readers,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.460]   have you ever asked why it doesn't say
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.900]   to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.160]   whether on earth or in heaven or under the earth?
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.040]   Why does Paul omit or under the earth?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.960]   And I say that because he uses that phrase
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.520]   in Philippians 2, 10 when he says
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.640]   that every knee will bow to Jesus
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.320]   and confess that he's Lord,
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   every knee in heaven, on earth and under the earth.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.400]   Even the unsaved will grant that Jesus is Lord.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.480]   But here in Colossians 1, 20,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.160]   he doesn't mention under the earth
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.640]   as what will be reconciled.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.680]   It only says that he will reconcile all things to himself
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.020]   in heaven and on earth.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.560]   So here's my suggestion.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.780]   Paul is not at all contradicting the fact
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.440]   that the Bible teaches eternal judgment on Satan
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   and his angels and on humans who are unrepentant.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   But all of those persons will be consigned
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.560]   to a realm outside the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:47.680]   In Matthew 22, 13, Jesus calls this outer darkness.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.920]   They will be in a realm that is not part
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.560]   of the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.120]   Everything in the new heavens and the new earth,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.800]   that has been contaminated with sin in any way,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.280]   will be reconciled, will be redeemed.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.540]   So when Paul says that all things will be reconciled
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.440]   in heaven and on earth,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.560]   he means that because of the work of Christ,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.320]   there will be nothing unreconciled on earth,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.920]   nothing unreconciled in heaven
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.280]   when God consummates his purposes.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.880]   For demons and unbelievers,
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   there will be another entirely different realm of existence,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   which we call under the earth or outer darkness,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   but it will not be part of the new creation.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.360]   All things, all things will be reconciled
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.600]   in that earth and that heaven.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.520]   So that's my answer to the first part of the question.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.440]   So let's turn to the second question.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.660]   What would it mean to speak of reconciling
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.840]   anything or any being in heaven?
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.800]   What in heaven needs reconciling?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.200]   What would Paul mean when he says,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.160]   "Through Christ, God reconciles to himself,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.020]   "whether on earth or in heaven, all things."
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.560]   And one answer is implicit in what I've already said,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.240]   namely, he may not be talking about reconciling
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.920]   what is in heaven now,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.440]   but what will inhabit the new heavens
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.800]   and the new earth.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.040]   And his point is, nothing contaminated by sin
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.760]   will inhabit the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.640]   That's not reconciled to God.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.960]   Everything will be reconciled that's there.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.280]   But if someone pushes back and says,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.720]   "Well, it looks, Piper, like it's referring
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.200]   "to the present heaven and earth,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.800]   "not just the future heaven and earth,"
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.080]   then my suggestion would be, if they're right,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.160]   and I'm mistaken in that first suggestion,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.960]   Paul teaches in the next chapter, Colossians 3, 4,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.520]   and in Philippians 1, 20, and in 2 Corinthians 5, 8,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.120]   that Christians who have died are now in heaven,
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.400]   and Paul would then be saying,
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   all of them are reconciled to God by the work of Christ.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.560]   That's my suggested answer to the pushback
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.960]   and the suggestion that he may be referring
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.340]   to the present heaven, not just the future heaven.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.900]   Christians are there, Christians are reconciled in heaven
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.440]   through the blood of Christ.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.520]   One last question.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   How does the blood of Jesus establish peace
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.760]   in heaven and on earth?
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.680]   Paul says, "Making peace by the blood of his cross."
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.320]   And I had this question for two reasons.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   One, because we know that demonic beings
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.960]   not only inhabit the earth, but are referred to,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.440]   for example, in Ephesians 6, 12,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.000]   as being operative in the heavenly places.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.220]   For example, Job teaches that Satan
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.740]   had some kind of access to God.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.800]   And the other reason I ask this question
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.440]   is because Paul connects the blood of Christ
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.480]   with the defeat of the demonic rulers and authorities
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.900]   in Colossians 2, 15.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.020]   So right after saying that the record of our sins,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.840]   the record of our debts is nailed to the cross
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.860]   so that our guilt is removed and our forgiveness is secure,
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.760]   he says in Colossians 2, 15,
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.280]   that God, by this work of Christ,
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.020]   stripped or disarmed the demonic powers
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.880]   and shamed them and triumphed over them in him.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.280]   And I take that to mean that the blood of Christ
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   takes away the one damning weapon that Satan has,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.860]   namely the power to accuse us for sin
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.960]   because they're all forgiven, our sins are all forgiven.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.280]   He doesn't have that weapon because of the blood of Christ.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.340]   He's stripped of it, he's disarmed.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.600]   And with that triumph over Satan and his demonic forces,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.280]   all demonic hopes of victory are shattered
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.660]   and Satan is finally consigned to outer darkness
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.260]   with his forces.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   And in that way, complete peace is established
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.520]   in the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.600]   So when Paul says that God made peace
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.480]   through the blood of his son,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.940]   he meant not only that Christians enjoy no condemnation
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.000]   and peace with God forever,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.040]   but also that the marauding, tempting,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.500]   destructive work of Satan and his forces
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.280]   is totally disempowered and consigned
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.040]   outside the new heavens and the new earth forever.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.400]   There's only peace.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.240]   - So good.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.840]   And speaking of Satan being disarmed,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.240]   that's a question coming up next week, I believe,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.720]   next Monday.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.040]   Satan has been disarmed.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.080]   So which of his weapons are now gone?
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.360]   That's on February 28th.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.920]   A lot more to say along these lines
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.320]   of what power Satan has lost on this side of the cross.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.160]   Thank you, Pastor John.
