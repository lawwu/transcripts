[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.840]   found in the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter in the 16th
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.380]   verse. The 16th verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:28.760]   John. And of his fullness have we received and grace for or upon grace. We
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.680]   still preach upon this text because it is one of those texts which covers
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.480]   everything in life. Its first and primary and fundamental meaning is that the
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.960]   Christians life is one which is entirely derived from the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.840]   out of his fullness. And that means as I say that we have everything from him and
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.560]   there is never any situation in which we can ever find ourselves in which that
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.720]   fullness will not be available to us and will not be adequate to our need and to
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   our condition. And so it is this morning and this is one of those occasions
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.480]   therefore when as Christian people we should rejoice more than ever that it is
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.720]   true to say that it is of his fullness that we have received and grace upon
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.600]   grace. Now it devolves upon us to show how we do receive this fullness and how
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.920]   it manifests itself in our personal lives and experiences. And that is what
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.360]   we've been doing for a number of Sunday mornings and continue to do this morning.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   We have seen that the first thing we must realize is his fullness. If we are
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.560]   not clear about that, if we are not clear about him, we'll never receive anything
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.720]   from him. We've got to be clear about the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.280]   realize that all the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily in him when he was
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.000]   here on earth. It had been in him from all eternity and it is still in him,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   seated at this moment at the right hand of God in the glory everlasting. But we
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.840]   have seen also that before we can receive of it, certain things have to
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.060]   happen. And we've traced how he came into this world and humbled himself and did
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.740]   various things and submitted to things that were done unto him in order that it
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.800]   might be possible for us to receive of this fullness. And then, and we've been
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.720]   concentrating very much on this the last few Sunday mornings, he had to take this
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.400]   fullness of his and use it and imply it and exercise it on our behalf before we
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.120]   could ever receive of it. And he has done so. There is nothing that is essential to
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.200]   the soul of men and his salvation but that it has already been done and done
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.400]   in great fullness and completeness by the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.880]   Christ. Thank God help has been laid upon one that is mighty. God has sent his own
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.960]   Son for no one else to deliver us. There was none other good enough to pay the
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.120]   price of sin. There was none other that could unlock the gates of heaven and let
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.680]   us in. But here is one who because of his eternal fullness, God and men, was strong
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.360]   enough to do everything that was necessary. And as we were reminding one
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.800]   another a fortnight ago, and remember on Sunday, he rules over all. The government
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.560]   is upon his shoulders and he reigns forever. He doesn't come and go. His is an
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   eternal kingdom, an everlasting kingship, and his reign and his rule are without
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.240]   end. But now having thus seen how he has exercised this fullness that is in him
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:26.400]   on our behalf, it is necessary also for us to realize how this fullness of his
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.720]   is applied to us. And here we come, of course, to the more practical aspect of
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.880]   our subject. His fullness in here and in him, his fullness has exercised on our
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.800]   behalf. And now I say that fullness as it is applied to us, so that we begin to see
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.640]   how it is that we are entitled to say of his fullness have we received and grace
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.080]   upon grace. Now there is a statement fortunately made by the Apostle Paul in
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.840]   his first epistle to the Corinthians and in the first chapter which gives us a
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.960]   very perfect summary of this whole matter. And therefore I want to call your
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.360]   attention to it in particular. It is the 30th verse in the first chapter of Paul's
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.480]   first epistle to the Corinthians. "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.760]   made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.480]   according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord." Now
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:47.080]   the statement is this. Of him, that's to say of God, are ye, that's to say
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.720]   Christian people, in Christ Jesus. A Christian is a man who is in Christ
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:03.040]   Jesus and he has been put into Christ Jesus by God. Of him are ye in Christ
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:14.400]   Jesus who of God is made unto us. Now you see he with all his fullness is made
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.080]   unto us by God certain things. What are they? Well here they are, here is the list.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:29.280]   Wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Now I want to call your
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.820]   attention this morning in particular to that first statement about Christ having
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:46.360]   been made unto us wisdom. Wisdom from God. Here is a theme which is developed
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:54.840]   considerably in the New Testament, that Jesus Christ has become our wisdom. Now
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.560]   the Apostle states it again in the second chapter of that first epistle to
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.760]   the Corinthians in verse 16. He asks a question, "Who hath known the mind of the
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.320]   Lord that he may instruct him?" And he answers the question by saying, "We have
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:17.000]   the mind of Christ." We as Christian people have got the mind of Christ by
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.840]   which he means that we are able to think as the Lord Jesus Christ thought. We have
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.800]   the same outlook, we have the same wisdom, we have the same understanding. Or take
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   it as the Apostle puts it in writing to the Colossians, these people who were
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.480]   tending to turn to the various cults and things of that description. What the
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   Apostle says to them is this, "In whom," he says, "of the Lord Jesus Christ are hid
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.160]   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." He prays that these Colossians
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.680]   may come, "and to all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.640]   acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ, in whom
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:10.200]   are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." Now then, the statement is
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.960]   this, that those who are Christians are in Christ, and in Christ are all the
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:24.320]   treasures of wisdom and of knowledge that God has himself. Now here is a
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:31.480]   tremendous matter for us to consider together. Christ is made unto us wisdom.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.000]   We receive of his fullness, and a part of that is that we receive his wisdom, God's
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.040]   wisdom, in Christ. It's all stored in Christ, and it's there for us, and we
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.800]   receive of that. And the result of that is, of course, as the Apostle again puts
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.960]   it in the second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 5 and verse 17, "If
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.400]   any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. All things are passed away;
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:08.880]   behold, all things become new." In other words, you will find in the New Testament
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.520]   that there is a constant contrast in comparison made and drawn as
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   between what is called the wisdom of the world, the wisdom of this world, and the
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.280]   wisdom of God, the wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently, the
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:33.800]   wisdom of the Christian men. Now, this is a part of this fullness that we receive
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.840]   from Christ. Primarily, of course, the wisdom applies to our knowledge of God.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:46.120]   The world by wisdom knew not God, and it was because the world by wisdom knew not
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.960]   God that it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.480]   that believe. The world lacks a knowledge of God. That's why the world is as it is
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.880]   this morning. It doesn't know God, doesn't believe in God. But the Christian is in
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:08.440]   an entirely different position. Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.360]   made, and to us wisdom. Very well, here I say is one of the most remarkable aspects
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:21.160]   of this receiving of the fullness that is in the Lord Jesus Christ. The first
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.600]   thing it enables us to do is to know God. But, of course, that includes almost
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.800]   everything else. It isn't confined directly and only and solely to a
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.480]   personal knowledge of God. It is something that leads on to a knowledge
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:48.320]   of God in all his ways and in all his activities. So it follows that the wisdom
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.720]   that we receive from the Lord Jesus Christ is a wisdom that enables us to
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.820]   understand God's dealings with this world in a way that nobody else can do.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:11.120]   And that is how, you see, this great text of ours, John 1 16, speaks more directly
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.440]   to us and to the whole world this morning than anything else that you can
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:23.720]   ever think of. The wisdom that we receive from God through the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.520]   to understand this world, to understand life, to understand everything that
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.120]   happens in it. There is nothing that can ever happen to us, I say again, but that
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.520]   this gospel speaks to it, and speaks to it in a very direct manner. But, as I'm
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.180]   going now to show you, it always speaks in a manner that is unique. It's entirely
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:54.440]   unlike the world. It speaks with its own wisdom, its own understanding. And so one
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.960]   of the first things we have to realize about ourselves as Christian people is
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.720]   that we look at everything in a different way. We react to everything in
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.520]   a different way from everybody else. A Christian is different. He can't help it.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.440]   He's been born again. He's got the mind of Christ in him. He's got this wisdom
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   from God. He's in Christ, and therefore he's drawn of this fullness, this
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:28.920]   fullness of wisdom and understanding. And so he looks out upon everything in an
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:37.480]   entirely different manner. Now I say entirely different manner, and yet in a
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   sense I want to qualify that for just a moment or two. What I want to put before
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.200]   you this morning is how the Christian looks out upon the world position as it
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:56.040]   is at this second, and how all who are not Christian look upon it. I'm concerned
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.480]   primarily, of course, with the Christian attitude. The other is familiar to all of
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.680]   us. We see it in the newspapers, on the television, and hear it on the radio. The
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.240]   world is expressed there. Our business is to understand and see very clearly how
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.600]   the Christian, with the wisdom that is given to him out of Christ's fullness,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:23.200]   looks upon exactly and precisely the same thing. Now let me start, I say, by a kind
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.400]   of qualification. While it is right and true to say, and we must say, that the
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.640]   Christian is altogether different. He is in Christ. He's a new man. He's a new
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.080]   creation. All things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. That is
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.640]   a fundamental proposition from which we must never depart. We must never lose
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.160]   sight of. We are to live by that principle. But we must say this, in
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:59.080]   addition. To say that does not mean that the Christian is unnatural. I've got to
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.160]   make this negative point. The Christian is not a monster. The Christian is not
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:13.920]   unnatural. The Christian is not of this world, but he's still in it. And up to a
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:21.680]   certain point, he shares life and its experiences with everybody else.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.280]   Sometimes Christian people have tended to forget this, and have turned
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.560]   themselves, because of their failure to understand the true teaching of the New
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:42.760]   Testament, into eccentrics and almost monstrosities. The Christian, I say, is
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:54.320]   still natural, in the sense that he still feels things, like everybody else feels.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   The Christian still feels sorrow. He still feels sympathy. He still reacts
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.920]   with horror and pain, to the kind of thing that happened in America last
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.600]   Friday. For a man to think that he is being an exceptionally fine and
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.080]   spiritual Christian, to say that's got nothing to do with me, that belongs to
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   the world, is a complete misunderstanding of Christian teaching. The Christian is a
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:33.400]   man who should be more sensitive than anybody else, because he sees the horror
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:39.520]   of things more than anybody else. Jesus wept, not out of mere sympathy. It was
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.280]   partly sympathy, but much more because he saw what sin had done in the world, and
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:52.880]   he wept over it, and groaned in his spirit. And any man who doesn't feel
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.320]   sympathy for a widow, for children, suddenly bereaved, is not an exceptional
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:06.520]   Christian. He's a very poor Christian. He's a muddled Christian in his thinking.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:14.560]   Now the Christian, though he is this unique and new person, he is still in the
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:21.640]   flesh. He is still in the body. And as I am trying to say, he should be more
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.020]   sensitive to all the pain and the suffering and the agony that is in the
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.600]   world, than anybody else. A second point I would make under this negative
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   qualification is this, that the Christian therefore must always be very careful
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:44.160]   that he doesn't become otherworldly in a wrong sense. I mean by that this, that
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.400]   there are some Christians who seem to think that it is no part of the
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.520]   Christian's business to be concerned at all about this world and what happens in
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:58.080]   it. There are many Christians who regard it as terrible for a Christian, for
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.280]   instance, to go in for politics. I have known Christian people who have regarded
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.560]   that as a sin. They hold up their hands in horror. Politics to them is something
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.460]   that belongs entirely to the world. Now that is, of course, entirely contrary to
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:20.720]   the New Testament teaching. That is a false otherworldliness. The Christian
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.600]   doesn't contract out of the world. Why? Well, because he knows that this is still
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.420]   God's world. And God hasn't abandoned this world. Take that verse, those verses
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.280]   that we were reading out of Romans 13 at the beginning. "The powers that be are
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   ordained of God." It is God who's appointed kings, queens, presidents,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.800]   governors, forms of government, magistrates. All these are ordained of
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.760]   God. What for? Well, because this is still his world, and he's got an ultimate
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   purpose for it. And in the meantime, side by side with the salvation that takes
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.120]   men individually out of it into God's kingdom, God is keeping this world in
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:07.760]   order. He is restraining it. He is putting bounds upon the manifestations of evil.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:15.200]   It is God who commends the magistrate to use the sword. And he doesn't use it in
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:22.080]   vain. Not only that, we are in this world, and we are to give honor to whom honor is
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.160]   due. Let's never forget that when the Apostle wrote that to the Romans, the
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.680]   Emperor in Rome was a man called Nero. But the Christian people had to pay honor
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   to him, not to the men, but to his position. And so we are taught constantly
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:45.200]   in the Scriptures to do this, to honor all men, fear God, honor the King, and so
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.600]   on. These are part of the instruction which is given to the Christian. So the
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.280]   Christian is not being an unusually good and spiritual Christian by withdrawing
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.920]   himself right out of the world, and just living a little life of feeling his own
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.320]   spiritual pulse, and worrying about his own temptations and sins and problems,
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.360]   and always talking about them, and interested in nothing else. I believe
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.480]   that we need to say a thing like this at this present time. I wonder whether the
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.960]   world is in its present predicament because too many Christian people in
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:24.360]   this and in other nations have contracted out of life, and have not been
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:32.080]   playing their true and legitimate part in the life of the nation. If it is true
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.240]   to say that politics is a dirty game, well isn't it about time that clean men
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.040]   went into it? Are we to abandon these things to people whom we regard as
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.560]   pagans and as worse? Now we are living at a very solemn time in the history of the
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.880]   world. If you listen to some of the journalists and others who are commenting
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:59.000]   on the present situation, you might very well come to the conclusion that there
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.120]   is no man left in the world this morning who is capable of handling the situation.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   I don't believe that for a second. But you see what is stated implicitly in
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.760]   that kind of statement. Has the world in all its sophistication and cleverness,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.680]   and with all its bursting in the 20th century, come to such a position and to
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:29.320]   such a pass that the removal of one man leaves nothing but chaos? Is that true?
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.800]   It's the pagan journalists who are saying that. I don't agree with it. I
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:40.840]   believe it is not true. But God knows it is far too true. And here I say there
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.200]   should therefore be a call to Christian men and women to realize that this is
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.400]   God's world, and that it is a part of our Christian faith and practice to see
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.000]   that this world is kept in order, that sin and evil should be kept within
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.460]   bounds, and that men and women should be compelled in a measure to acknowledge
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.240]   God and to live according to his holy laws. Very well, there are my negatives.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.680]   Let me turn to the positive. Here are the differences, and the striking
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.000]   differences, between the way in which the non-Christian and the Christian
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.280]   approaches a situation such as this. The first difference is in the whole
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.560]   approach, of course. The Christian, when he views a situation like this, doesn't
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:33.660]   start with a situation and end with a situation as such. He doesn't merely make
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:40.560]   a number of general comments about it, which are mainly political. He doesn't
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.320]   merely talk about men and about events. He doesn't, I say, speak as a pagan
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.160]   statesman could speak on this occasion, and give expression to political
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.640]   opinions, and make appeals to people in certain respects, or talk vague
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.840]   generalities with a little tinge of religion upon it. That's not the
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:09.160]   Christian position at all. The Christian's outlook upon everything is governed by
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:16.040]   the revelation which he has in the Bible. This is the wisdom from God. You see,
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.640]   there are only two possibilities this morning, with regard to our thinking and
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.320]   our outlook upon life, and upon the whole present situation. We are either
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.160]   approaching it in terms of human thought, human philosophy, human understanding,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.440]   which includes, of course, politics, sociology, and economics, and all the rest
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.400]   of it. We are either doing that, or else we're looking down upon it all from the
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:46.120]   standpoint of this wisdom. You see, there's a fundamental difference at once.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:53.520]   Haven't you been noticing it the last 48 hours? How the world looks upon this
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:01.280]   situation entirely without the angle of revelation. There's nothing beyond men.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:07.240]   The thing is not put into a grand context. It is seen in and of itself, and
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.840]   they never see anything beyond it. So the whole fundamental outlook and approach
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.720]   are all together and entirely different. Or another way of putting that, secondly,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.600]   would be to put it like this. The difference between the two outlooks is
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:29.000]   mainly one of depth, depth of understanding. The world never sees
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.120]   anything except that which is on the surface, and it reacts very superficially.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.600]   It has no other dimension, of course. It believes men is everything, there is
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.840]   nothing apart from men, men is in control of the affairs of this universe, and
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.640]   there is no higher power, there is no ultimate authority, there is no other
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.920]   activity. It's entirely human. So it looks on the surface, on the horizontal, and it
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:03.560]   sees nothing but that. But the man who has got the mind of Christ, the man who
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.600]   has this wisdom that is obtained from God through the teaching of the Bible,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:14.440]   is in an entirely different position. He looks at it not in terms merely of an
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.280]   incident which happens, but he says, "Why does it happen? Why do such things happen
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.320]   at all?" So he doesn't stop at the surface. He says, "There's a cause for this," and he
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:32.400]   goes back to his biblical doctrine of men in sin, the biblical doctrine of the
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:39.240]   fall. He doesn't merely say, "Isn't it awful?" or then begin to consider it in terms of
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.760]   personalities and possibilities, and call in the experts to give their forecasts
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.880]   of what's going to happen. No, that's the world the Christian man sees this whole
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:57.640]   problem in its fundamental depth. He says, "Of course, in the light of the whole
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.800]   doctrine of the fall and of men in sin, this is the kind of world we have. It's
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.640]   the kind of world we're living in. It is the kind of world in which we must
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.160]   expect this kind of thing, therefore, to happen." And he realizes, therefore, that
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.200]   the world is but manifesting itself as it rarely is. Now, the world doesn't do
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.980]   this, and that's why it gets so shocked when certain things happen. But the
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.780]   Christian knows that this is the kind of thing that must happen. But he knows,
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:30.400]   thank God also, the purpose of God which is above and beneath and beyond it all,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.800]   and which will be carried out, come what may. Very well. There's an entire
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   difference with regard to the depth in which the problem is regarded. But let me
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.200]   go to another point. Another striking characteristic of the men who has the
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   mind of Christ, or the men who has this wisdom that is from God, is that there is
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:02.000]   a remarkable consistency about him. And his view doesn't change, it is a
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.600]   constant view. He isn't found advocating one thing very strongly one day, then in
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.720]   a few years almost advocating the exact opposite. The moment a man begins to see
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.680]   the whole of life in terms of the biblical teaching with the mind of
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.200]   Christ, he's got a whole view. I've often quoted those words of Matthew
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.080]   Arnold, "He saw life steadily and he saw it whole." And the result is that he
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.000]   doesn't have to change, he doesn't have to modify his position. But the man of the
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.080]   world does, and he's constantly doing so. You read the lives of some of the
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.240]   greatest statesmen the world has ever known, and you'll find there have been
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.320]   great changes in their point of view. They've changed their parties, they've
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.800]   changed their outlook, they've changed their philosophy. It's very
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.760]   characteristic of these men. Why? Well, because they haven't got a fundamental
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.560]   point of view, which is always there, and which always explains everything. So they
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:07.600]   come and go, and they change. I was reading the review of this last week of
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:14.160]   a book by a modern writer. He gives it the title "The Intellectual Part."
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:21.280]   Here is one of your modern intellectuals, Rainer Heppenstall, and he writes this
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.160]   book, "The Intellectual Part." It's a kind of autobiography. What does he say? Well,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   he gives an account, rarely, of how his position has moved from what was once a
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:39.840]   kind of non-political leftism, to a point which is now so far to the right as to
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:52.360]   be almost invisible. Now, that's just typical. I speak as realising that we are
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:58.120]   in the presence of God. I heard the announcement on the wireless this
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.800]   morning of the death of another popular writer, Mr. Aldous Huxley. Mr. Aldous
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:12.760]   Huxley, in the 20s, was one of these leftist, pure intellectuals. But by now he
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.600]   had changed his position completely, and had written a phrase like this, "The only
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:25.880]   hope for the world is mysticism." He'd entirely moved his position from a pure
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.040]   intellectualism, a scientific intellectualism, to a position in which
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:37.480]   he sees all that as hopeless. The brave new world is gone. There is no hope for
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:44.400]   the world but mysticism. And he had become a Buddhist. Now, this, I say, is so
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:51.200]   characteristic of the world. It is always moving, always changing, because it hasn't
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:57.400]   a fundamental and a profound understanding. But the man who has the
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.280]   mind of Christ has a permanent point of view. Here it is. It's been applicable
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.120]   throughout the running centuries. It is as applicable this morning as it has
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.680]   ever been. Let me put that in another form, in the fourth place, by saying that
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.840]   the Christian's view, as the result of having the mind of Christ, is always a
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:20.640]   realistic view. And when I say realistic, I'm contrasting it, of course, with two
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.680]   tendencies in the world and its thinking. The world, on the one hand, is
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.720]   over-optimistic, and on the other hand, it is over-pessimistic. Haven't you noticed
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:40.640]   these variations? The over-optimism of the world. A man appears, and they
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.680]   pin all their hopes on him. Here is a man who's come, the only man who can deal
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.400]   with the situation. This man's going to transform everything. And they write, and
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.120]   they speak, and they get excited. Everything is in this man. Here is the
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:30:00.360]   man, here is the Savior. They put their faith in men and in programs. And
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:06.800]   everything is suspended upon this man, or this program. That's the over-optimism
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.480]   of the world. It is convinced that given the right men, the whole world can be
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.520]   put right. So they hang on his lips, and they hold on to him, and he's everything
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:25.240]   to them. The result is, of course, when he suddenly dies or is assassinated, they're
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.800]   left in a position of utter hopelessness and complete despair. That's the
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.760]   over-optimism. But then, on the other hand, and the same people very often swing
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:43.720]   right over to the other extreme, in which they become hopelessly pessimistic and
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:50.400]   cynical and utterly despairing. There are many such men in the world at the
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   present time. You can often read their comments in some of the weekly journals,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.640]   and sometimes you can hear them and see them on the television. They're
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.280]   completely hopeless. I'll use the term. I don't like using it, but it's being used
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.800]   by the world. It is what's called a bloody-mindedness, by which they mean
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:15.440]   this, that this world is absolutely and completely hopeless. So there's only one
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.240]   thing to do. Eat, drink, and be merry. Don't believe in anybody nor in anything at all.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:29.040]   Sit in your corner and smile cynically at whatever happens. That is the
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.680]   over-pessimism, which I contrast with the over-optimism, and they're both wrong.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:39.360]   But that's typical and characteristic of the world. Now, contrasted with that,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.600]   you have, of course, the realism of the Christian. What do I mean by that? Well, I
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:53.720]   mean this. The Christian does never expect too much from this world. That's
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.160]   why he never gets excited. That's why he never becomes passionate over politics.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:06.400]   That's why there's never hatred involved in his politics, because he
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.880]   doesn't expect too much. He knows. He knows what man is, and he knows also that
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:19.000]   this over-optimism is something which is quite divorced from the facts of
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.400]   life, something which is quite unreal, something which can never happen in this
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.120]   sinful world, because we are told here that this world is never going to be
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.200]   reformed. If you had a thousand of the greatest statesmen the world has ever
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.280]   known, they'd never put this world right. It cannot be. That's the fundamental
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.480]   proposition of the Scripture. This world is a doomed world. It's under the wrath
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.520]   of God. It is a damned world. The Christian doesn't expect too much of it,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.640]   and therefore he's not surprised and disappointed when he doesn't get it. His
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.240]   whole view is not shaken when these things happen, because, I say of this,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:12.600]   fundamental realism. Now this isn't cynicism. This is realism. He knows the
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.520]   possibilities. He knows what can happen, and of course, I haven't got time to
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.280]   develop this this morning, he knows and sees the purpose of God, certainly and
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   surely being carried out. So he's able to view the situation with this measure
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:33.840]   of detachment that enables him always to arrive at a realistic verdict upon
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:42.960]   anything that may chance to take place. And then I can put it like this, and this
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.000]   is a point at which we should all examine ourselves this morning. The
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.040]   result of having this wisdom from God, this mind of Christ, is that the
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:04.000]   Christian is calm. The Christian is confident. The Christian should never be
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.280]   hysterical. You've seen the world is hysterical. We've been witnessing a great
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:17.840]   deal of hysteria the last 48 hours in intellectual people. You see, their
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.120]   intellectual point of view doesn't help them, and when it doesn't, ultimately
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.880]   they become hysterical. You've read of people collapsing and failing to go on
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.760]   and so forth. Now that's sheer hysteria. The Christian should never be hysterical.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:34.360]   The 112th Psalm and the 7th verse puts it like this about these good men, "He shall
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:42.000]   not be afraid of evil tidings." His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. "He shall
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.160]   not be afraid of evil tidings." He's not always waiting for it to happen, the
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:55.200]   calamity that's about to come. No, no. His heart, "He shall not be afraid of evil
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:02.840]   tidings." His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. The man who has the mind of
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:09.360]   Christ is a man who has a sense of proportion. He has balance. He's not
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.160]   stampeded. He's not carried away on waves of emotion. His preaching isn't
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.000]   determined by what happens in the world. He's not a topical preacher. He's an
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.640]   expounder always of the Scriptures, and he knows the Scriptures always speak,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.400]   whatever may happen. He doesn't start with situations. He starts with the Word
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.320]   of God, and he sees that it speaks to everything and to every conceivable
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:39.000]   situation. That's the Christian. He's got a sense of proportion. He's got a sense of
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:47.600]   balance. The world hasn't, of course. The world is full of grief and sorrow today.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.680]   It'll be forgetting it in a few hours. It's already forgotten it in many
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.240]   instances. It's a surface emotion. It's a passing one. It's a form of hysteria, and
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.280]   it's of no value. The world goes violently to one direction and then to
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.600]   another, and that's why the world is as it is and will continue to be as it is
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:13.360]   until Christ comes back again and routs all his enemies and sets up his eternal
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.760]   kingdom of righteousness. But the Christian is not to be carried away by
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:29.720]   these things. He has his own understanding, and it's a balanced one. He's not
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:35.960]   surprised. He should never be taken by surprise in a world like this. He knows
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   what man in sin is capable of. He also knows that there is a limit to men at
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.800]   his best and at his very highest. He doesn't pin his faith, I say exclusively,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:37:00.600]   in any man, in any group of men. He knows that while the world is governed by the
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:08.080]   God of this world, the devil, there will be wars and rumors of wars. There will be
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.280]   evil, and it will manifest itself sometimes in horrible manners. But he
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:19.560]   knows that it's there even when it's masquerading as gentleness and as
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:26.480]   affability and as love. The Christian doesn't merely see things as they are on
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:33.120]   the surface. He sees them beneath the surface. Very well, my dear friends, I
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:39.960]   leave it at that for this morning. But we should thank God more than ever that we
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.360]   have the mind of Christ, that we have received of his fullness and grace upon
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:54.320]   grace. We should thank God that he has made Christ to be unto us wisdom, that we
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.600]   are able to draw of all those treasures of wisdom and of knowledge that are
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:07.320]   there for us in the Lord Jesus Christ. How are we thinking about life at the
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:15.800]   present time? How have we reacted to this horrible crime, this terrible thing that
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:24.680]   has happened? I hope that our hearts have been filled with sympathy and compassion
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:31.640]   for the young widow and the young children in America, and for the American
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:42.020]   people. I hope we are praying for them and praying for ourselves. God grant that we
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:49.840]   may learn, all of us, more and more to humble ourselves under the almighty hand
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:57.900]   of God. Oh, that what the world is feeling today in its occasional mood of
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.520]   tenderness, oh, that the Spirit of God might come down and take hold upon it,
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:09.880]   and so send this word of wisdom to it, that men and women from now on will
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:17.280]   begin to walk in the fear of the Lord, understanding life in this world as it
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:24.640]   is in the hands of the devil, and begin to live a life which, denying ungodliness
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:32.280]   and worldly lusts, lives soberly, righteously, hurriedly, looking for and
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:43.320]   waiting for that glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, the Lord Jesus
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:53.040]   Christ, of his fullness, have all we received, in grace upon grace. Thank God
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.720]   for the measure of the extent to which we can say assuredly this morning, we
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:04.640]   have the mind of Christ. Amen.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:15.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 60, the 60th hymn. Lord God by whom all change is
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.400]   wrought, by whom new things to birth are brought, in whom no change is known, hymn
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.240]   number 60.
