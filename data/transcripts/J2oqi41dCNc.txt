[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.440]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.500]   Today, we are discussing exercise and brain health,
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.680]   which includes brain longevity and brain performance,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.840]   our ability to learn new information
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.160]   over long periods of time and indeed into old age.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.340]   Today, we are going to discuss
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.280]   how different forms of exercise,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.920]   resistance training, cardiovascular training
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.720]   of both long, medium, and short duration
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.320]   can be used to improve the way
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.400]   that your brain functions acutely,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.960]   meaning immediately in the minutes and hours
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080]   and the day that you do that exercise,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.900]   as well as in the longterm,
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.740]   in the days, weeks, and months
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.680]   after you perform that exercise.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.760]   And of course, if you're exercising regularly,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.200]   the effects of exercise on brain health and performance
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.900]   compound over time, making you better able to learn things,
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.640]   better able to retain information from the past,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   and indeed to expand your brain's capacity
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.700]   to learn new types of information in new ways.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.560]   In researching today's episode,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.320]   I quickly came to realize that the number of studies
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.960]   that have explored the relationship between exercise,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.000]   brain performance, and brain health,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.380]   as well as the range of different types of exercise
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.280]   that have been explored in that context is extremely vast.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.800]   There are literally tens of thousands of studies
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   on this topic, as well as meta-analyses and reviews,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.300]   all of which point to positive effects
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.600]   of doing exercise of various types
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.840]   on brain health and performance.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.080]   Within those many, many studies,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.240]   you'll find many, many different exercise protocols
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.440]   that lead to improvements
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.560]   in brain performance and longevity.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.040]   So the goal of today's episode
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.720]   is to synthesize that vast amount of information
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.600]   into a logical framework that simplifies it
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.560]   and clarifies it and places it within the context
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.120]   of specific mechanisms, both neurobiological mechanisms
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   and endocrine-based mechanisms,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.440]   that together can very well explain the data
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.160]   on how exercise impacts brain health and longevity,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   such that by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.560]   you'll have both some specific recommendations
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.800]   about how to use exercise
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   for sake of brain health and performance
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.000]   that I believe will be new to most of you,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.720]   as well as the ability to think about the mechanisms
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.960]   and the logical framework
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.400]   that wraps around this incredibly large literature
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.020]   on exercise and brain performance,
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.560]   so that you can customize your exercise program
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.360]   on the basis of how much time you have available,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.200]   your specific age, your health status,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.620]   and the specific types of brain changes
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.600]   that you might be seeking through the use of exercise.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.160]   And I should also say that by learning
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.400]   how exercise impacts brain performance and brain health,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.800]   you're also going to learn some of the incredible ways
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.780]   that your body communicates with your brain
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.920]   and your brain communicates with your body,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520]   not just during exercise, but all of the time.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.920]   So today, you're going to learn a lot of practical tools,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.360]   of course, about exercise, brain health, and longevity.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.760]   It's based on research that is incredibly interesting,
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.560]   in some cases, surprising,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.160]   and in almost all cases, actionable.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.700]   As some of you may already know,
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.960]   I have a book coming out this year, 2025,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.400]   entitled "Protocols,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.920]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.980]   I'm super excited about the book.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.240]   It includes protocols,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.460]   that is actionable steps that anyone can take
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.240]   to improve their sleep, motivation, creativity,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.440]   gut microbiome, nutrition, exercise,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.040]   stress modulation, and much more.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   Now, the book was originally scheduled
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.080]   to be released in April of 2025.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.920]   However, to make sure
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.560]   that the book reflects the latest scientific research,
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.600]   I've decided to expand on the yes,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.560]   already finished version of the book,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.000]   to make sure that the protocols
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.680]   are as up-to-date as possible
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.640]   and reflect the most modern and best findings.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.600]   So the new release date for protocols
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.000]   is going to be September of 2025.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.940]   I do apologize for the delay in release,
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.780]   but I assure you that I will make it worth your wait.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.900]   To learn more about the book
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.780]   or to secure a copy by presale,
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.100]   go to protocolsbook.com.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.700]   There you'll find all the information about the book,
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.220]   as well as the various languages
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.220]   that the book will be translated into.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.140]   Before we begin,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.200]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.920]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.220]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.060]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.100]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.540]   to the general public.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.660]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.460]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.580]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.320]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.540]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.360]   Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.180]   Therapy is an extremely important component
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.220]   to overall health.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.200]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.020]   just as important as getting regular exercise.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.380]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.700]   that great therapy provides.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.620]   First, it provides a good rapport
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.140]   with somebody that you can really trust
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.380]   and talk to about any and all issues
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.240]   that concern you.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.620]   Second of all, great therapy provides support
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.300]   in the form of emotional support,
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.820]   but also directed guidance,
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.740]   the do's and the not to do's.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.700]   And third, expert therapy can help you arrive
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.780]   at useful insights
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.220]   that you would not have arrived at otherwise.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.140]   Insights that allow you to do better,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.780]   not just in your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.420]   but also the relationship to yourself
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.260]   and your professional life and all sorts of career goals.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.780]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.020]   to find an expert therapist
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.660]   with whom you can really resonate with
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.160]   and provide you with these three benefits that I described.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.220]   Also, because BetterHelp is carried out entirely online,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.440]   it's very time efficient
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.540]   and easy to fit into a busy schedule
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.340]   with no commuting to a therapist's office
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.380]   or sitting in a waiting room
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.200]   or looking for a parking spot.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.700]   So if you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.100]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.200]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.500]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.800]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.780]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.060]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.980]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.860]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.380]   physical health, and performance.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.880]   Now, the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.260]   in the quality of sleep that you get each night.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.440]   How soft that mattress is or how firm it is,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.940]   how breathable it is, all play into your comfort
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.580]   and need to be tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.020]   So if you go to the Helix website,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.820]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.780]   that asks you questions such as,
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.980]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.740]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.740]   Things of that sort.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.360]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.200]   maybe you don't.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.500]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.340]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.020]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.900]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.260]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.980]   and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.580]   so much so that when I travel to hotels and Airbnbs,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.820]   I find I don't sleep as well.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.240]   I can't wait to get back to my Dusk mattress.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.560]   So if you'd like to try Helix,
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.700]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.140]   Take that two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.900]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.580]   that's customized for your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.420]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.540]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.660]   to get up to 25% off.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.100]   Okay, let's talk about the relationship
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.980]   between exercise, brain health and longevity and performance.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.300]   And let's just take a couple of minutes
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.300]   and really clearly define what we mean by exercise,
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.220]   because most of us have a concept of what exercise is,
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.920]   but for sake of understanding the relationship
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.060]   between exercise and brain performance,
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.820]   most of the peer-reviewed studies
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.300]   focus on two general categories of exercise,
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.100]   either cardiovascular exercise or resistance training.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.900]   Now, of course, cardiovascular exercise
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.940]   can be a very short duration, high intensity,
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.360]   so getting heart rates up way, way, way up,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.460]   or longer duration, lower intensity.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.620]   Now, typically, the amount of time scales with that,
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.620]   so the shorter intensity stuff
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.980]   tends to be quick bouts of either 30-second, 60-second,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.820]   sometimes two-minute or even four-minute all-out effort
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.300]   with some period of rest afterwards,
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.580]   or longer duration, 20, 30, 45,
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.100]   or even 60 minutes of cardiovascular training
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.820]   at a more steady state, lower intensity.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.860]   And I should mention that within the tens of thousands
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.340]   of studies that are out there exploring the relationship
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.340]   between exercise and brain health and longevity,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.140]   you will mostly see studies
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.220]   focused on cardiovascular exercise.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.660]   And most of those studies early on
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.780]   were focused on the longer duration, lower intensity stuff.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.620]   So typically, 30 to 60 minutes of lower intensity,
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.020]   yet still elevating the heart rate exercise.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.580]   Nowadays, there's more of a focus
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.500]   on the high-intensity interval training.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.460]   And today, we're even going to hear about some studies
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.860]   that involve very, very short bursts,
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.700]   so-called sprints of activity, a short of six seconds long,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.180]   followed by a period of rest,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.980]   repeated for a number of times,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.700]   and exploring what the effect of that sort of,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.220]   I should say, very, very short intensity exercise
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   is on immediate and long-term brain health and performance.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.640]   Okay, so cardiovascular training
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.940]   of different durations and intensities
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.220]   involving different durations of rest
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.500]   are one category that we're going to talk about today.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.780]   The other category of exercise
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.620]   we're going to talk about today is resistance training.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.700]   Now, most of the studies involving resistance training
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.940]   and their effects on the brain,
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.380]   both brain longevity and brain performance,
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.920]   focus on either compound, so multi-joint movements,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.160]   so think squats, deadlifts, bench press, shoulder press,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.860]   dips, et cetera.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.580]   But very often, and this is just a by-product
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.140]   of how studies are done in the laboratory,
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.300]   very often, the exploration of the relationship
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.580]   between resistance training and brain health and longevity
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.660]   are single-joint isolation exercises,
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.240]   like a single-leg leg extension, even.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.080]   You might be thinking,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.780]   "Wait, just one leg doing the leg extension?"
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.340]   Yes, the reason for that,
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.580]   and I spoke to some of the scientists
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.620]   that do this sort of work,
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.060]   is that when they have subjects do a, say,
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.360]   seated single-leg leg extension
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.900]   as the form of resistance training,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.480]   I know I and some of you are probably chuckling like,
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.080]   "Really? Of all the things you could select
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.360]   to see if it impacts brain health,
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.240]   you're going to have people kick up one knee?"
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.460]   Yep, you do that. Why?
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.440]   Well, most people can do that type of movement.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.860]   It doesn't take any training,
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.360]   or it just takes a little bit of direction
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.200]   as to how to do it,
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.600]   so it can be done reasonably safely by many people,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.360]   including people that are non-athletes,
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.960]   often older than 65 years old,
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.300]   not that there aren't some very fit 65-year-olds,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.260]   but just people who are older than 65
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.220]   but don't have a lot of athletic background,
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.720]   can sit down in a chair,
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.180]   put the pin at the appropriate weight,
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.220]   and move their knee,
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.220]   or rather elevate their foot while seated in a chair,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.780]   so-called single-leg leg extension,
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.880]   and also it gives the benefit of the opposite leg
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.700]   within subject control for comparison
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.280]   in terms of strength increases.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.300]   Okay, so set aside any kind of, you know,
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.140]   like eye rolls or chuckles that you might have
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.780]   about single-leg leg extensions
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.040]   as the total form of resistance training
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.300]   that's being explored,
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.580]   because yes, those studies are still informative.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.980]   In fact, they perhaps even identified the lower threshold
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.680]   for the amount of resistance training
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.860]   and type of resistance training
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.220]   that could benefit the brain,
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.900]   but we also see studies that involve compound exercises,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.300]   so having people do free weight squats,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.140]   or even weighted squats, or deadlifts,
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.180]   or, you know, bench-press-dip-deadlift-type combinations.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.480]   Again, when you look at the literature
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.020]   exploring exercise and brain health,
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.420]   you're looking at studies that, in the best cases,
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.100]   are very tightly controlled.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.380]   That typically means having people do them
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   in the laboratory in a very specific way,
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.460]   sometimes using untrained subjects,
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.340]   meaning when the subjects arrive at the study,
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.740]   they haven't done much exercise of that sort.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.700]   Sometimes it's involving trained subjects.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.800]   Both have their caveats, of course,
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.500]   but keep in mind that during today's discussion,
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.060]   I'm going to be pooling at many times
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.300]   across all these studies
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.600]   exploring cardiovascular exercise
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.500]   of different duration and intensities,
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.380]   resistance training of different types,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.660]   and sometimes different intensities as well,
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.400]   but where there is a specific piece of knowledge
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.900]   that can be gleaned from understanding
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.460]   the exact type of exercise that was done
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.820]   and a specific type of brain change,
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.640]   especially in cases where it's been shown
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.420]   to be especially beneficial,
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   I will be sure to highlight that.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.900]   So, as we proceed in today's discussion,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.160]   keep in mind, exercise is many things,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.460]   two general categories.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.000]   Most of the studies focus on high intensity
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.860]   or low intensity cardio.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.180]   Most of the studies involve
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.060]   either single joint isolation exercises,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.720]   sometimes even single joint, single leg isolation exercises
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.540]   or compound exercises.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.920]   And keep in mind that most of the studies
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.120]   exploring the relationship between exercise
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.860]   and brain health and performance
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.100]   are done to explore two types of changes,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.340]   either what are called acute changes,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.620]   meaning immediate changes,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.200]   so they have people do the exercise,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.100]   and then they have them take a cognitive test
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.320]   or some other form of test
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.660]   that analyzes brain health and performance,
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.220]   or they look at chronic effects,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.860]   which are what are the changes in brain performance
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.120]   and health over long periods of time,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.900]   meaning having people do a particular type of exercise
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.500]   anywhere from two to four times per week,
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.580]   although typically it's three times per week,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.620]   and doing that for anywhere from four weeks to six months.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.940]   Again, all of this relates to the practical aspects
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.300]   of running controlled studies in the laboratory.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.840]   So if by now you're thinking this is really complicated,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   how is it that we're supposed to tease out
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.520]   the best things to do given this huge ball of barbed wire
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.080]   of different types of studies, variables, et cetera?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.920]   Well, I assure you,
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.380]   we are going to make this very clear and very actionable.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.680]   And the thing to keep in mind
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.080]   is that fortunately, most all of the studies,
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.720]   yes, most all of the studies
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.140]   that have explored the relationship between exercise,
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.040]   brain health, and longevity and performance
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.240]   find positive effects.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.300]   Now, for some of you who are skeptics,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.720]   you might be thinking, well, great,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.640]   so you can do any form of exercise.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.440]   Well, in some sense, yes,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.840]   I'll actually tell you this right off the bat.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.520]   There are good data showing
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.040]   that if people do six second sprints,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.100]   max all out sprints on a stationary bicycle,
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.120]   followed by one minute rest,
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.620]   and repeat that six times,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.620]   you see significant acute effects on brain performance.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.140]   So the brain performance could be a memory task.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.580]   Sometimes it is a memory task.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.980]   It could be what's called a Stroop task,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.500]   which is a cognitive flexibility task
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.340]   where you have to distinguish
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.060]   between the colors that words are written in
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.460]   and the content of the words.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.620]   Okay, so-called Stroop task.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.980]   I've talked about this on previous podcasts.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.380]   I'll talk about it a little bit more later.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.460]   Regardless of the cognitive test that's used,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.360]   that very short duration, high intensity training
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.380]   increases performance significantly.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.800]   As well, 20 or 30 minutes of so-called steady state cardio,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.660]   you know, figuring out how fast you can run,
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.100]   or row, or swim, or stationary bike.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.840]   For 20 to 30 minutes at a steady state,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.900]   and then you analyze people's cognitive performance
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.740]   on a memory task.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.860]   It can be a working memory task,
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.880]   so remembering a short string of numbers,
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.040]   or it could be math problems.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.960]   It could be the Stroop task.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.700]   Any number of different tasks reveal the same thing,
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.420]   which is that the longer duration, lower intensity cardio
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.460]   also significantly improves performance.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.240]   Now, does that mean that you can do six rounds
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.580]   of six seconds of sprinting with a minute in between,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.380]   or 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.880]   and get the same effect on brain performance?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.540]   Well, if you're just looking at overall improvements
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.380]   in performance.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.340]   So for instance, the percentage of information
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.940]   that you learn if you do, or you don't do the exercise,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.900]   or if you compare those two forms of exercise
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.220]   that I just mentioned.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.960]   In that sense, yes, it really doesn't make a difference,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.320]   which may have you scratching your head,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.980]   but in a few moments, I'll explain why that is.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.500]   On the other hand, different forms of exercise,
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.720]   of course, impact our bodily health differently.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.780]   Higher intensity, shorter duration exercise,
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.820]   of course, impacts things like VO2 max
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.580]   and which circulating hormones and neuromodulators
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.100]   are going to be present very differently
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.780]   than longer duration, lower intensity exercise.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.800]   So too, if you have people do
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.740]   single joint isolation resistance training exercises,
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.120]   like a single leg leg extension,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.240]   or both legs leg extension,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.780]   versus 10 sets of 10 in a squat exercise,
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.380]   you're going to see very different specific adaptations
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.180]   at the physical level, at the bodily level.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.880]   But in every case where you explore the acute,
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.060]   the immediate changes that occur in brain output
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.680]   and function, after people do that sort of exercise,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.780]   you're going to see significant increases.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.740]   When one does physical exercise,
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.160]   short duration, high intensity, cardio,
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.520]   or higher intensity resistance training,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.940]   single joint training, compound training,
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.740]   single joint isolation exercises, compound exercises,
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.660]   one sees these increases in brain performance,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.860]   at least acutely in the immediate stage after the training.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.620]   So we have to ask ourselves, why is it, how is it,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.740]   that all these different forms of exercise
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.380]   are positively impacting brain performance?
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.700]   And the answer is very simple and fortunately,
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.020]   gives us tremendous leverage over our exercise
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.300]   and how to impact our brain health.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.260]   And the answer is arousal.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.420]   However, the answer isn't entirely arousal,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.060]   meaning not all of the positive effects of exercise
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.180]   on brain health, longevity, and performance
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.940]   can be explained by arousal.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.460]   But when I step back from the literature,
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.040]   again, an enormous literature,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.900]   tens of thousands of peer-reviewed papers,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.220]   many of which are done exceptionally well, by the way,
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.020]   as well as meta-analyses and reviews,
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.100]   I think it's fair to say that probably 60 to 70%
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.860]   of the effects of exercise on brain health,
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.260]   performance, and longevity can be explained
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.220]   by the specific shifts in our physiology,
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.140]   both bodily physiology
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.260]   and directly within the brain's physiology
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.180]   during those bouts of exercise,
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.380]   which is this increase in so-called autonomic arousal,
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.500]   which occurs during the exercise,
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.940]   but also extends into a window
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.100]   after the exercise is completed.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.900]   So we have to talk about this relationship
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.380]   between exercise, arousal, and acute brain performance,
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.880]   meaning the improvements in brain performance
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.460]   that happen immediately after the exercise.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.140]   And then we'll shift our focus to the effects of exercise
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.740]   that occur more chronically,
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.500]   that is the effects of exercise
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.540]   on brain health and performance that occur
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.300]   in the hours, days, weeks, and years after we exercise,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.180]   even if we are continuing to exercise every day
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.840]   or three times a week or whatever the frequency might be.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.420]   But this issue of arousal is extremely important,
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.900]   and I assure you, it's not trivial.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.660]   In fact, it will help you understand a number of things
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.540]   in the domains of deliberate cold exposure, stress, trauma,
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.300]   and most importantly for today's discussion,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.900]   it will help you design an exercise program
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.380]   that's geared towards giving you
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.860]   the maximum bodily health effects
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.940]   and the maximum brain health effects.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.820]   Okay, in order to understand the relationship
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.680]   between exercise, arousal, and learning,
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   we have to really clarify the relationship
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.400]   between arousal and learning.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.340]   That's going to set the stage
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.040]   for pretty much everything else we're going to talk about
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.120]   for the next 10 minutes or so.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.620]   And it's oh so cool.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.740]   It also gives me the opportunity to review a paper
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.820]   that I've long loved,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.540]   which comes from Larry Cahill's group down at UC Irvine
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.540]   entitled Enhanced Memory Consolidation
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.820]   with Post-Learning Stress,
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.500]   Interaction with the Degree of Arousal at Encoding.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.300]   This is just one of several papers from the Cahill group,
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.780]   which essentially identified the following.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.980]   There are a couple of different ways
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.360]   you can increase so-called autonomic arousal
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.340]   or levels of alertness.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.460]   Sometimes it's called stress,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.160]   but autonomic arousal is simply an increase
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.480]   in the amount of activity in the so-called sympathetic arm
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.620]   or the autonomic nervous system,
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.060]   which is nerd speak for more alert, more aroused,
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.760]   wide-eyed, ready to move, higher heart rate,
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.700]   higher blood pressure, more alertness.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.220]   This is a great state to be in for learning material
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.720]   provided it's not too much alertness, too much arousal.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.640]   Turns out this paper shows it's also a great state to be in
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.220]   after you've been exposed to material
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.260]   that you want to learn.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.940]   And it's also the case that in this paper
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.280]   and in many, many other papers
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.940]   from this and other laboratories
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.420]   that you can increase levels of autonomic arousal
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.880]   by having people put their arm into ice water
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.300]   for one to three minutes, the so-called cold presser test.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.900]   It's a very commonly used standard test.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.680]   This paper and many other papers show
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.180]   that it leads to very rapid and significant increases
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.960]   in circulating levels of cortisol,
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.980]   which yes, sometimes it's called a stress hormone,
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.460]   but it's really just a hormone involved
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.320]   in the stress response,
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.160]   but does a bunch of other things too.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.740]   So they use that as a tool
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.300]   after people have been exposed
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.540]   to certain types of information to ask,
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.980]   does elevation in cortisol,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.660]   AKA autonomic arousal,
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.460]   improve one's ability to remember information?
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.400]   And the answer is yes.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.800]   This study shows that,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.380]   several other studies from the Cahill
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.800]   and other laboratories show that
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.380]   sometimes those studies use people
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.900]   putting their arm into ice cold water.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.060]   Other times they'll inject them with a drug
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.700]   that increases adrenaline, also called epinephrine,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.180]   sometimes also increases cortisol.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.580]   The point being that elevations in autonomic arousal
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.340]   after one is exposed to information
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.220]   increases one's memory for that information
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.060]   and one's memory for the details of that information.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.380]   Now, in this particular study,
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.220]   they compared emotionally laden
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.940]   versus non-emotionally laden information
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.980]   and a bunch of other details,
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.460]   which are interesting if you choose to peruse the study,
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.140]   but I should mention that other studies from this
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.020]   and other laboratories have shown time and time again,
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.660]   increases in autonomic arousal
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.140]   measured by increases in cortisol
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.300]   or adrenaline also called epinephrine or norepinephrine,
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.980]   which is the sort of analog within the brain
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.420]   that consistently leads to better memory
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.300]   for information that one has been exposed to,
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.580]   better memory for the details of that information,
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.080]   and oftentimes better ability to work with that information,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.160]   to come up with new ideas with that information
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.600]   or to think logically about that information in new ways.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.780]   In other words, increasing autonomic arousal
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.920]   improves learning and memory.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.440]   Now, it's also very important to understand
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.620]   that that increase in autonomic arousal
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.360]   can improve learning and memory
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.440]   if the autonomic arousal occurs
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.340]   after the exposure to the material.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.820]   Most people find that a bit surprising.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.760]   I certainly did when I first read this paper.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.180]   It makes sense if you start to think about
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.960]   the persistence of memories for things like traumas
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   or bad events, right?
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.840]   Bad event happens and there's this big spike
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.440]   in cortisol and adrenaline
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.360]   and those memories are hard to eradicate.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.240]   They're certainly hard to remove the emotional content from.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.740]   And if you think about it, in those instances,
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.240]   the event happens and then comes the big increase
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.560]   in cortisol and adrenaline.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.360]   So that maps very well onto the study
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.040]   that I'm describing here.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.080]   In addition, however, lots of studies have shown
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.040]   that increasing autonomic arousal
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.020]   as measured by increases in adrenaline or cortisol or both
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.040]   or any number of different measures of autonomic arousal
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.320]   that occurs during the exposure to the new material, okay?
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.260]   So this isn't trauma.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.760]   This is like new math material, new history material,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.900]   new music material, new motor skill material
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.800]   that you're trying to learn.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.900]   Increases in autonomic arousal that occur
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.340]   as you're trying to so-called encode the information,
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.300]   you're being exposed to that new information
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.260]   also significantly improve learning.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.540]   And it's always through increases in arousal.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.460]   In other words, whether or not
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.340]   you're measuring cortisol, adrenaline,
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.120]   heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response,
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.060]   how wide someone's pupils are
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.140]   or small someone's pupils are
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.960]   or any combination of those things
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.040]   or any other measures of autonomic arousal,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.600]   the consistent takeaway is increases in arousal
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   during or after, in particular after
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.360]   trying to learn a certain material
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.480]   is going to improve significantly
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.620]   the amount of material that one learns,
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.640]   the details of that material
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.580]   and the persistence of that learning over time.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.800]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.480]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.140]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.220]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.020]   As somebody who's been involved in research science
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.260]   for almost three decades
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.460]   and in health and fitness for equally as long,
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.300]   I'm constantly looking for the best tools
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.460]   to improve my mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.180]   I discovered AG1 way back in 2012,
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.000]   long before I ever had a podcast
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.580]   or even knew what a podcast was
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.900]   and I've been taking it every day since.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.300]   I find that AG1 greatly improves all aspects of my health.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.860]   I simply feel much better when I take it.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.940]   AG1 uses the highest quality ingredients
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.260]   in the right combinations
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.140]   and they're constantly improving their formulas
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.900]   without increasing the cost.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.400]   In fact, AG1 just launched their latest formula upgrade.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.660]   This new formula is based on exciting new research
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.420]   on the effects of probiotics on the gut microbiome
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.460]   and now include several clinically studied probiotic strains
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.340]   shown to support both digestive health
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.860]   and immune system health,
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.780]   as well as to improve bowel regularity
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.300]   and to reduce bloating.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.660]   Whenever I'm asked if I could take just one supplement,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.060]   what would that supplement be?
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.780]   I always say AG1.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.260]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.620]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.740]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by David.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.220]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.020]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.780]   only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.780]   That's right, 28 grams of protein
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.640]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.740]   These bars from David also taste amazing.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.020]   My favorite flavor is chocolate chip cookie dough,
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.460]   but then again, I also like the chocolate fudge flavored one
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.980]   and I also like the cake flavored one.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.820]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.340]   They're incredibly delicious.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.340]   For me personally, I strive to eat mostly whole foods.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.220]   However, when I'm in a rush or I'm away from home
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.220]   or I'm just looking for a quick afternoon snack,
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.420]   I often find that I'm looking
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.580]   for a high quality protein source.
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.980]   With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.680]   with the calories of a snack,
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.720]   which makes it very easy to hit my protein goals
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.140]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight each day.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.460]   And it allows me to do that
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.460]   without taking in excess calories.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.740]   I typically eat a David bar in the early afternoon
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.180]   or even mid afternoon if I wanna bridge that gap
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.740]   between lunch and dinner.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.020]   I like that it's a little bit sweet,
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.500]   so it tastes like a tasty snack,
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.440]   but it's also given me that 28 grams
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.860]   of very high quality protein with just 150 calories.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.260]   If you would like to try David,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.580]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.040]   Again, the link is davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.180]   Okay, so now we've established the elevated levels
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.220]   of autonomic arousal either during or after,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.420]   and indeed also before about of learning,
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.140]   the so-called encoding phase of learning
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.780]   when we're exposed to the new material
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.540]   that we want to learn and remember are all beneficial.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.940]   This is wonderful news.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.420]   When we look out on the whole of the literature
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.540]   on the relationship between exercise
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.180]   and brain health and performance,
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.140]   we see studies that incorporate exercise
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.320]   either before or after about of learning.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.620]   And we also find studies, believe it or not,
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.700]   that combine exercise with learning in real time,
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.900]   literally exposing people to new material
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.540]   that they're expected to learn or trying to learn
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.020]   while they're walking on a treadmill
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.380]   or running on a treadmill or cycling or rowing.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.100]   Yes, those studies have also been done,
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.980]   although for practical reasons,
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.280]   they're not as numerous as the studies
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.140]   exploring the relationship between exercise and learning
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.900]   where the exercise is done before
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.820]   or after the bout of learning.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.780]   Okay, so what this means is wonderful.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.580]   What this means is that if you want to use exercise,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.800]   not just for enhancing your bodily health,
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.900]   but also for brain health and performance,
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.640]   you can do that exercise before, during,
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.920]   or after bouts of learning.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.180]   That allows you to look at the constraints of your life.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.040]   For instance, are you one of these people
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.580]   that can get up at five or six or 7 a.m.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.780]   and exercise before everyone else gets up
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.600]   or before your workday starts or your school day starts,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.900]   do a round of exercise
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.760]   and then get into your bouts of learning,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.460]   whatever that material may be?
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.460]   Or are you somebody who has to dive into the workday,
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.860]   school day, family obligations, et cetera,
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.860]   in which case you might only be able to exercise
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.100]   later in the day,
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.260]   but you're probably still somebody
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.860]   who would like to enhance their brain health and performance.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.520]   So in that case, you might organize
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.700]   the thing that you're trying to learn,
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.220]   the encoding or the exposure
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.500]   to the thing that you're trying to learn,
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.740]   either in written form,
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.780]   so you're reading or you're listening to it,
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.020]   or you're attending a class or classes,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.460]   and then exercising after you're exposed to that material
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.600]   in order to get that elevated levels of arousal,
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.560]   not unlike the arrangement of the studies
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.260]   that I was talking about earlier,
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.180]   which used the ice exposure
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.460]   in order to generate increases in arousal
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.380]   and thereby to improve learning and memory.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.740]   So in the show note captions for this episode,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.820]   we've batched a number of different references
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.060]   that have explored the relationship
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.260]   between exercise and cognitive performance.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.900]   And across those studies
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.060]   and the ones that are referenced therein,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.900]   you'll find studies
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.340]   where the exercise bout was done before,
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.740]   where the exercise bout was done during,
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.100]   where the exercise bout was done after
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.140]   a round of learning or encoding of information.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.540]   And I should mention that different studies
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.980]   focus on different cognitive tasks.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.940]   So exercise and the arousal associated with exercise
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.540]   has been shown to acutely improve recall.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.820]   So just raw recall of material, the details in material.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.300]   It's been shown to improve cognitive flexibility
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.740]   through things like the Stroop task.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.740]   And so in a very convenient way,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.140]   exercise has been shown to acutely improve performance
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.900]   on all those sorts of brain and memory tasks,
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.180]   which is greatly reassuring to all of us
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.380]   because what it means is that
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.620]   it probably doesn't matter so much
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.980]   when you do your exercise
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.700]   or what it is that you're trying to learn.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.020]   It's going to be beneficial
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.180]   as long as the thing that you're trying to learn
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.700]   and the exercise are positioned fairly closely in time.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.480]   Now, the one caveat to that
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.740]   is that several studies have explored the relationship
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.380]   between short duration, high intensity interval training
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.540]   and cognitive performance.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.420]   In particular, executive function,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.280]   that cognitive prefrontal flexibility
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.700]   that we were talking about a few moments ago.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.620]   And on the whole, all of those studies
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.340]   point to improvements in executive control and function.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.620]   So that context dependent switching of knowledge
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.940]   and your ability to think about things
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.760]   in a very agile way, if you will.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.620]   If people did a high intensity interval training session
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.740]   just before they do that bout
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.360]   of cognitive flexibility learning.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.540]   However, several studies have also looked at the effect
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.620]   of repeated bouts of high intensity interval training.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.720]   And in some cases, looking at the mechanisms
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.580]   by which high intensity interval training
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.340]   improve cognitive performance.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.900]   And the basic takeaway is the following.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.580]   And again, I'll provide references to these
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.160]   in the show note captions.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.820]   The high intensity interval training done before
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.060]   or believe it or not even during
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.860]   cognitive flexibility tasks.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.980]   A couple of studies have actually explored that.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.220]   Significantly improves performance on those tasks.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.780]   Again, we believe this is likely
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.500]   through enhanced levels of arousal.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.660]   Although some data also point to the fact
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.280]   that it's also likely through enhanced cerebral blood flow.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.900]   Simply more blood being delivered to the brain
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.100]   during or in particular
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.380]   after high intensity interval training.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.860]   More blood, more fuel and other molecules
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.220]   being delivered to the brain during a cognitive task
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.900]   or cognitive flexibility task.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.660]   Makes sense why that would improve cognitive function.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.700]   And yet when studies have explored the consequence
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.100]   of doing multiple high intensity interval training sessions.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.460]   And when I say high intensity, I mean high intensity.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.540]   These are studies where lactate is elevated.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.820]   We'll talk more about lactate in a few minutes.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.540]   Where typically people's heart rate
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.040]   is either close to or at their maximum heart rate
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.220]   for some period of time, either 30 seconds, 60 seconds,
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.740]   two minutes, or in some cases,
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.180]   people are pushing really, really hard for four minutes,
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.380]   then resting for four minutes,
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.820]   then pushing really hard for four minutes,
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.140]   then resting for four minutes.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.700]   Four times over the so-called four by four program
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.260]   that I know a number of you have heard about.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.820]   If you haven't, it's very intense.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.800]   So you can imagine all out for four minutes, then rest,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.340]   all out for four minutes, then rest.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.700]   Doing that several times in a day.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.620]   Okay, so two bouts of four by four
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.680]   or two high intensity interval training sessions of any kind
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.060]   has been shown to diminish cognitive performance
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.700]   if the cognitive task comes
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.100]   after the second high intensity interval training session.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.660]   Now, for most of us, including me, that makes sense.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.740]   You think, well, they're tired.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.260]   People aren't able to focus as much
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.060]   because they're devoting all this energy to the exercise.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.700]   And indeed that's true,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.820]   although the mechanism is interesting.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.900]   The studies that have looked at this
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.020]   have actually found that cerebral blood flow
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.920]   during the two bouts of high intensity interval training
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.060]   are more or less equal.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.420]   So it's not that the first session
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   necessarily precludes high performance
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.300]   in the high intensity interval training session
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.700]   in the second session.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.180]   But then when you go on to try and do a cognitive task
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.500]   that's demanding and also requires elevated levels
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.820]   of cerebral blood flow, you find that performance drops.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.740]   And this is correlated with reductions
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.060]   in cerebral blood flow that come from doing
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.460]   too much high intensity interval training.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.300]   Now, I have to acknowledge
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.100]   that most people aren't doing multiple
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.460]   high intensity interval training sessions per day.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.580]   But this is a reminder, an important reminder, in fact,
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.500]   that if you're using exercise
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.380]   to try and improve brain health and function,
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.420]   or even if you're just somebody who's exercising
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.140]   but is also expected to use their brain
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.340]   to learn things throughout the day, as most of us are,
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.200]   and to attend to things throughout the day,
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.620]   you need to be cautious about not overdoing
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.260]   the high intensity interval training sessions.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.040]   This is also true for resistance training.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.300]   You need to be aware that very high intensity exercise,
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.340]   yes, increases cerebral blood flow
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.180]   and the delivery of all these fuels
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.080]   and other compounds to your brain during the exercise.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.220]   If you do that correctly and you don't overdo it,
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.380]   you can capture some of that wave of blood flow,
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.380]   fuel, et cetera, as you enter the learning session.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.900]   But if you quote unquote overdo it,
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.740]   then you're going to arrive to that bout of learning
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.900]   with reduced cerebral blood flow,
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.100]   and you're going to be in a state
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.780]   that it's very difficult to focus and learn new information.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.300]   So there is such a thing as too much arousal from exercise
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.260]   that leads to troughs in arousal
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.880]   that diminish cognitive performance and learning.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.380]   Now, all of this is focused, of course,
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.540]   on the relationship between exercise and brain function
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.440]   at the acute level, the immediate level.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.820]   It's fair to say that all high intensity exercise
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.900]   and resistance training is going to support brain function
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.020]   in the chronic sense, in the long-term sense.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.780]   In fact, the literature points to that.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.780]   And once again, I've batched the references
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   for this episode so that they're grouped together
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.420]   according to the specific topics and timestamps.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.340]   And the two studies that I recommend you look at
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.900]   if you're interested in this relationship
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.700]   between high intensity training and cognitive function,
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.020]   in particular, executive function,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.340]   that cognitive flexibility I was talking about earlier,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.060]   such as in the Stroop task,
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.740]   there's a wonderful article entitled
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.780]   "Executive Function After Exhaustive Exercise."
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.860]   That's one to look at.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.540]   And the other one, which I think is really nice,
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.140]   and therefore I've placed there,
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.320]   really points to the way that a single bout of exercise
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.820]   can acutely improve brain function,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.140]   in particular, executive function.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.340]   And the title of that paper, not surprisingly,
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.580]   is "A Single Bout of Resistance Exercise
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   Can Enhance Episodic Memory Performance."
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.700]   Here's a fun one.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.680]   As I continue to hammer on this thesis
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.900]   that so many of the positive effects of exercise
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.800]   on brain health and performance,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.140]   at least in the acute sense, immediately after the exercise,
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.500]   in some cases during the exercise, are due to arousal,
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.660]   well, then it should make sense
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.980]   why things like so-called exercise snacks,
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.540]   this idea that throughout the day,
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.580]   you suddenly do 25 quick jumping jacks,
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.740]   or you jump up and down five times,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.260]   or you do 20 air squats.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.740]   We've heard about exercise snacks in different contexts,
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.860]   such as adjusting blood glucose levels.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.860]   You hear a lot about that.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.300]   After meals, take a walk,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.220]   or do some jumping jacks really quick,
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.580]   or do 20 air squats throughout the day.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.540]   And people talk about
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.260]   the sort of outsized positive effects of those.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.100]   Well, check this out.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.740]   When it comes to high-intensity interval training
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.280]   and positive effects on cognitive performance,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.740]   there's a study entitled,
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.020]   "The Influence of Acute Sprint Interval Training
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.260]   on Cognitive Performance in Healthy Younger Adults."
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.460]   And this study has people do six-second all-out efforts.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.380]   You heard that right, six seconds, okay?
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.900]   So six, six seconds.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.900]   It always is tricky.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.060]   They always use the same numbers,
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.380]   the four by four by four.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.540]   Okay, six.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.140]   Yes, the number six.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.780]   Six-second all-out efforts,
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.980]   sprinting on basically a stationary bike,
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.060]   and then a period of rest of one minute
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.820]   between those six-second all-out efforts.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.540]   And they see a significant improvement
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.060]   in cognitive performance.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.660]   So yes, it's true that you can do very brief,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.500]   very intense bouts of exercise.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.580]   I mean, just think about six seconds of sprinting,
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.660]   one minute of just cruise or rest, six seconds,
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.300]   and then just repeat for six sprints total
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.740]   of six seconds each, and experience an enhancement.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.940]   That is an acute or immediate enhancement
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.740]   in cognitive function.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.140]   And I can imagine no other mechanistic explanation
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.660]   for that aside from increased levels of autonomic arousal.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.580]   Any other mechanism that you could envision,
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.380]   you know, IGF-1, irisin, BDNF,
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.060]   things that we'll talk about in a few minutes.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.780]   Yes, those might be deployed as well.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.980]   But in terms of seeing something so brief,
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   having such a fast action on cognitive performance,
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.280]   and given what you now know about the relationship
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.780]   between arousal, focus, and cognitive performance,
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.100]   I'd be willing to stake, let's say six of my 10 fingers
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.100]   on the idea that it's all due to enhanced autonomic arousal.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.700]   Okay, let's talk for a few minutes about the mechanisms
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.420]   by which exercise improves brain health and performance.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.980]   And I realize when I say mechanism,
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.220]   some of you may say, okay,
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.300]   well, I just wanna know what to do.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.600]   I don't need to hear about the mechanisms.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.620]   But in this case, understanding just a little bit
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.180]   about the pathways by which exercise impacts the brain
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.100]   can give you a ton of leverage
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.180]   in designing the best exercise schedule
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.820]   for your brain health and performance.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.780]   And frankly, for your exercise schedule generally,
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.500]   to generate things like fat loss, improvements in strength,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.320]   hypertrophy, endurance, and so on.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.280]   In fact, let's do this mental experiment together.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.700]   If we were to ask ourselves,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.900]   how is it that exercise improves brain health
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.460]   and performance, based on what you know now,
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.460]   you'd probably say, well, it increases arousal,
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:47.100]   the catecholamines, so dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.820]   It probably increases heart rate,
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.060]   so more blood pumping to the brain and so on and so forth.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.220]   And you would be correct about all of that.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.880]   But let's just think a little bit more deeply
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.380]   about how exercise actually impacts the brain
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.740]   in the short and long-term and ask ourselves,
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.420]   what are the different physical pathways?
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.360]   What are the different chemical pathways
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.180]   by which the movement of our body changes the way
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.240]   that our brain works in the short and long-term?
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.620]   So if we were to draw a stick figure of a human
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.940]   and orient ourselves to the different locations
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.940]   or organs in the body that contain potential sources
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.100]   of information for the brain,
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.420]   one place that we could start would be, of course, the heart.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.680]   When you do cardiovascular exercise of any kind,
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.020]   intense or not so intense, short or long,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.820]   your heart rate increases, your blood pressure increases.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.640]   Likewise, if you do resistance training,
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.200]   there will be heart rate increases.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.120]   Those heart rate increases will come down between sets,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.040]   but your heart rate tends to increase when you exercise.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.740]   That's sort of a duh.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.220]   Well, when your heart rate increases,
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.600]   there's actually both increased blood flow to the brain
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.240]   and the delivery of all the things that that blood carries,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.860]   but there are also neural pathways that carry signals
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.000]   about that heart rate, about those blood pressure changes
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.800]   to the brain in order to increase our levels of alertness
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.760]   and focus that we can leverage toward learning.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.200]   So the first location in the body
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.160]   that we know can communicate with the brain is the heart.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.600]   When our heart beats faster,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.080]   that's communicated to our autonomic nervous system,
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.000]   which resides in a number of different brain areas.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.440]   In fact, it's a network of brain areas that act in concert
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.760]   to create what we call autonomic arousal.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.400]   We also have another pathway that goes back from the brain
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.680]   to the heart and other organs that we call the vagus nerve,
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.400]   which is a two-directional pathway,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.980]   you know, up from the body to the brain
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.700]   and from the brain back to the body.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.980]   We're going to talk a lot about the vagus.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.260]   In fact, let's talk about the vagus now.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.580]   When we exercise, we release adrenaline,
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.440]   which is also called epinephrine from our adrenal glands,
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.520]   which are small glands that reside atop both of our kidneys.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.300]   That adrenaline or epinephrine, as it's also called,
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.780]   does many things in our body.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.580]   It's responsible for increasing our heart rate further.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.220]   It's responsible for a number of effects
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.920]   on the so-called endothelial cells
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.620]   that make up the vessels and capillaries.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.540]   And it has impacts on the neurons in our body
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.740]   that create all sorts of changes
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.060]   in the way that blood flows,
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.580]   how fast it flows, and so on and so forth.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.100]   Now, here's a key thing to understand.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.560]   Adrenaline, epinephrine,
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.060]   does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.540]   So the adrenaline from our adrenals
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.020]   doesn't actually get into the brain
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.100]   to stimulate elevated levels of alertness.
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.400]   Rather, it acts on receptors on the vagus nerve.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.380]   Again, the vagus nerve communicates with the brain,
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.860]   and also in the vagus nerve,
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.540]   certain brain areas communicate with the body.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.420]   So adrenaline has a lot of effects within the body,
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.320]   but when it's released,
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.820]   it also acts on so-called adrenergic receptors
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.340]   on the vagus nerve.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.780]   Then the vagus nerve is activated in a way
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.260]   that stimulates the activity of a brain area,
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.140]   because remember, the vagus goes from the body
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.340]   into the brain,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.660]   stimulates the so-called NST,
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.240]   and because neuroanatomists like to argue about naming,
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.060]   sometimes it'll also be called the NTS,
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.100]   the nucleus of the solitary tract,
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.660]   or the nucleus tractus solitaris.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.200]   Super annoying, I know.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.140]   Forget the acronym unless you want to know
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.120]   that it's sometimes NST and sometimes it's NTS.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.060]   Don't ask me why neuroanatomists do this.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.220]   In any case, the NST can then communicate
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.660]   with a really important brain area
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.300]   whose name you should remember,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.580]   which is the locus coeruleus.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.380]   The locus coeruleus contains neurons
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.360]   that release, among other things, norepinephrine,
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.780]   which is similar in action to epinephrine, but different.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.240]   Neurons in the locus coeruleus send those little wires
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.260]   that we call axons into the brain
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.980]   in a very widespread manner.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.340]   It's almost as if they're positioned to sprinkler the brain
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.260]   with a neurochemical,
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.940]   and that neurochemical is norepinephrine.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.300]   They also have the capacity to release other neurochemicals,
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.600]   but right now we're concentrating on norepinephrine.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.500]   When norepinephrine is released from the locus coeruleus,
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.580]   it has this tendency to elevate the levels of activity
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.660]   in other brain areas
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.660]   through this sort of sprinklering-like mechanism.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.340]   What that means is that other areas of the brain,
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.380]   such as your prefrontal cortex, such as your hippocampus,
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.540]   such as different areas of the hypothalamus,
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.700]   and indeed lots of brain circuits,
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.460]   all have a greater capacity to be engaged.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.980]   This is what we're talking about
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.220]   when we talk about autonomic arousal,
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.940]   release of adrenaline from the adrenals
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.420]   that has action within the body,
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.460]   elevated heart rate, blood pressure, et cetera,
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.200]   and then adrenaline also from the adrenals to the vagus,
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.780]   from the vagus to the NST,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.340]   NST to locus coeruleus,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.860]   and then locus coeruleus sprinklers the brain
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.120]   with this norepinephrine,
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.180]   raising the levels of baseline activity
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.380]   in all those brain areas
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.540]   and making them more likely to be engaged
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.460]   by things that we're trying to attend to,
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.060]   more likely to engage, say,
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.940]   the neurons of the prefrontal cortex
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.760]   that can learn context-dependent strategy switching,
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.300]   such as in a stroop task,
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.420]   or when we're trying to attend to information
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.020]   and we go, "Okay, here's something important.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.620]   "I need to pay attention to this."
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.580]   We're able to do that
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.980]   because of that elevated level of norepinephrine.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.940]   It facilitates, it's permissive
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.160]   for elevating our levels of attention and focus.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.380]   It's also permissive for our hippocampus
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.700]   to encode new memories
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.200]   and for a bunch of other brain areas
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.540]   to do their thing, so to speak.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.760]   So knowing these mechanisms is actually worthwhile.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.620]   If you've ever heard that exercise can give you energy,
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.060]   this is the basis of that statement, right?
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.260]   Many people, in fact, myself for many years thought,
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.220]   "Okay, I definitely have to sleep well
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.980]   "in order to have energy and focus."
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.940]   That's absolutely true.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.780]   Still true, will always be true.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.260]   "I should maybe have some caffeine,
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.840]   "be hydrated, well-nourished, all this stuff
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.700]   "in order to have the energy to exercise."
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.860]   But it's also true that exercise gives us energy,
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.000]   and this is how it gives us energy.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.380]   When we move our body, the adrenals release adrenaline,
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.780]   and the adrenaline acts through two different
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.620]   so-called parallel pathways within the body,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.640]   but again, it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.280]   so then there's a series of what we call signaling relays
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.380]   or circuit relays up to the locus coeruleus,
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.820]   and then a sort of analog, it's different,
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.500]   but an analog to epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.820]   is released within the brain,
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.700]   and lo and behold, we have elevated levels
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.340]   of both bodily energy and brain energy and focus
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.100]   that we can devote to that exercise,
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.800]   but also to the learning that comes after that exercise,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.220]   which explains pretty much everything
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.060]   that we've talked about up until now
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.560]   during the course of this podcast.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.100]   So the next time you're feeling a little tired
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.060]   and you don't want to work out,
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.460]   remember, exercise gives you energy
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.760]   through the pathways that I just described.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.620]   Now, anytime I talk about the adrenals,
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.740]   people start talking about adrenal burnout.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.180]   They say, "Oh, you burn out your adrenals."
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.460]   You know, there are these crazy theories
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.620]   that you'll hear out there.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.700]   You know, "Coffee burns out your adrenals."
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.580]   Not true.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.620]   You'll hear that if you exercise too much,
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.060]   it might burn out your energy or your adrenals.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.460]   Look, you have enough capacity within your adrenals
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.660]   to survive relatively long famines,
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.700]   to survive long bouts of challenge,
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.540]   stress of many, many different kinds,
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.340]   short challenges, and so on.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.540]   You're not gonna burn out your adrenals.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.300]   There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome,
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.220]   which is a real syndrome.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.620]   There are diseases of the adrenals,
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.600]   but that's not what we're referring to here.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.060]   You have plenty of adrenaline in your adrenals
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:52.180]   that you can deploy through movement, through exercise,
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.100]   to get the elevation and arousal, attention, and so forth
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.460]   that we've been talking about.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   In fact, there's a set of biological pathways
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.340]   that were just recently discovered
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.860]   that will allow you to understand how to use movement
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.020]   in order to engage your adrenals
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.980]   so that then those adrenals can release adrenaline,
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.460]   impact your vagus, impact the organs of your body,
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.500]   the locus coeruleus,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.100]   and elevate your levels of attention and focus.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.780]   And a lot of the core components of these pathways
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.340]   are highlighted in a paper that I absolutely love,
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.480]   another paper I absolutely love.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.920]   This is from Peter Strick's laboratory
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.120]   at University of Pittsburgh,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.340]   which is entitled "The Mind-Body Problem,
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.440]   Circuits that Link the Cerebral Cortex
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.480]   to the Adrenal Medulla."
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.320]   The adrenal medulla are those adrenals
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.140]   that I've been referring to in the body.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.340]   And the question that Peter Strick and colleagues asked
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.920]   was how is it that movement actually gets the adrenals
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.080]   to release adrenaline?
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:42.960]   Like, what's the signal?
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.480]   Does it come from the muscles?
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.820]   Does it come from the skeleton?
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.400]   It's perfectly reasonable to assume
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.320]   that there are signals that come from the muscles
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.520]   and from the skeleton that cause the adrenals
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.300]   to release adrenaline when we exercise.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.360]   But what Strick and colleagues did
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.580]   was actually super clever.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.760]   They took some new tools that had just become available.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.580]   These are tools that allow the tracing of neural circuits
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.720]   from organs in the body all the way back up to the brain,
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.360]   or from one brain structure to another brain structure,
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.780]   and then to yet another brain structure.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.280]   We don't have time to go into all the technical details,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.960]   but this is a technique
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.760]   that perhaps I'll talk about on a future podcast.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   It's one that my laboratory used for a number of years
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.000]   to trace other neural pathways.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.160]   What they discovered is that there are essentially
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.560]   three categories of brain areas,
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   all of which communicate with the adrenals
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.920]   and can cause them to release adrenaline
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.660]   to create this elevation and arousal and attention.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.400]   Those three brain areas include areas of the brain
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:42.320]   that are involved in thinking, what we call cognition,
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.280]   areas of the brain that are related
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.920]   to what are called affective states,
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.120]   which is just kind of a more general category
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.560]   that includes emotions.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.760]   Okay, if you saw the Huberman Lab podcast episode
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.600]   that I did with Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.960]   she explains beautifully the distinction
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.120]   between affective states and emotions.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.240]   But these are brain areas that basically relate
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.200]   to what we are feeling, or how we're perceiving
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.120]   our environment and how we're reacting to it,
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.080]   these sorts of things.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.920]   And then there's a third category of brain areas
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.000]   that most robustly communicates with the adrenals.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.040]   And these are a collection of brain areas
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.360]   that are all involved with movement
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.880]   of particular areas of our body.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.600]   These areas are broadly referred to as the motor network.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.000]   So these are areas of the so-called cerebral cortex,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.840]   which are on the outer portion of the brain.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.480]   And they send these wires down the spinal cord.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.760]   There's a little relay in the spinal cord,
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.280]   it's called the IML.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.720]   If you're interested in the anatomical details,
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.120]   I'll put the link to this paper in the show note captions.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.600]   In any case, these brain areas that are involved
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   in motor movement, send axons, those wires,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.080]   down to the spinal cord.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.120]   Then from the spinal cord, they send a relay out
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.800]   via what's called the cholinergic preganglionic neurons.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.120]   Basically what ends up happening is that acetylcholine,
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.520]   which is a neuromodulator, is released from these neurons
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.600]   that originate in the spinal cord onto the adrenal medulla.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.920]   And then the adrenal medulla, the so-called adrenals,
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.320]   same thing, adrenal medulla, adrenals, releases adrenaline.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.560]   That creates these effects in the body, on the heart,
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.120]   the muscles and other tissues.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.440]   And then as described before,
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.160]   that adrenaline also acts on the vagus,
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.160]   the vagus up to the NST, the locus coeruleus,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.400]   and we have this elevation in alertness.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.340]   So this paper and papers that came subsequent to it,
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.720]   really explain how it is that the movement of our body,
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.680]   AKA exercise, allows us to have this elevation
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.480]   in arousal and alertness.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.760]   It's a loop, okay?
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.480]   The adrenals release adrenaline.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.160]   They do these things by these two parallel pathways
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.400]   I've been talking about.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.180]   But your decision to engage these motor areas,
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.540]   to move particular areas of your body,
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.720]   is what deploys that adrenaline.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.120]   Now you might be thinking, well, duh, okay?
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.800]   When I exercise, there's adrenaline release.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.960]   In order to exercise, I need to move my body.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.720]   And these brain areas control the movement of my body.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.200]   But it's not a duh.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.920]   It's actually very profound because it turns out
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.200]   that the specific brain areas
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.560]   that best activate the adrenals,
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.840]   are the brain areas that control the muscles closest
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.560]   to the midline, the core musculature,
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.680]   and the brain areas that are involved in generating
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.240]   the sorts of movements that we would call
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.720]   compound movements,
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.880]   at least in the context of resistance training,
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.820]   or that are responsible for moving multiple joints
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.380]   at the same time.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.560]   So what this means in the practical sense is,
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.360]   if you are feeling sluggish, you want energy,
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.720]   or you're simply exercising both for bodily effects
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.560]   and for brain effects,
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.200]   you need the deployment of adrenaline, of epinephrine.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.120]   You need the deployment of norepinephrine in the brain.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.160]   And by the way, anytime you have a deployment
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.720]   of norepinephrine in the brain,
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.520]   almost always there's a coordinated action
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.120]   of release of dopamine,
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.760]   which most people have heard of by now.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.360]   Dopamine is involved in motivation
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.320]   as well as movement, et cetera.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.220]   So the simple takeaway here is,
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.400]   if you want to get the arousal that comes from exercise
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.080]   in order to use that arousal,
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.400]   to leverage it towards better cognition,
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.040]   brain health, et cetera,
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.680]   the key thing is to make sure that you're doing exercises
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.920]   that are compound exercises.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.620]   So that these would be the movements.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.780]   You can look these up, just say compound exercises.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.620]   You can put that anywhere,
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.180]   and you'll see that that includes things like squats,
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.000]   deadlifts, bench presses, dips, pull-ups, rows.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.800]   And yes, of course, you want to train your whole body
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.440]   so that you have symmetry of a function of strength,
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.880]   and you want to offset any injuries
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.700]   and things of that sort, or aesthetic reasons, perhaps.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.680]   But the idea here is, if you want energy from exercise,
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.400]   you want focus, you need the deployment
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.040]   of the neurochemicals that we've been discussing,
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.480]   most notably epinephrine and norepinephrine.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.980]   And through the identification of this motor network,
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.300]   as well as the affective and cognitive networks
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.720]   that converge on this area of the spinal cord
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.620]   and then send communication to the adrenal medulla,
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.260]   you can essentially control the levels of arousal
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.980]   that your body and brain produces.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.120]   So in describing this,
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.200]   my hope is that you'll no longer think about exercise
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.920]   as just elevating your heart rate,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.600]   or you no longer think about exercise
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.680]   just as moving your body,
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.440]   but rather that the movement of your body
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.600]   is creating specific neurochemical outcomes,
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.840]   both in the body and the brain that create the arousal
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.960]   that initiates the improvements in focus and attention
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.480]   that allow you to learn better,
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.440]   and that contribute generally to brain health and longevity.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.520]   And of course, you aficionados out there will remind me,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.280]   I'm sure, but I'm going to beat you to the punch here.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.960]   Yes, your hypothalamus is also talking to your pituitary,
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.440]   which releases certain chemicals into your bloodstream,
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.480]   which also go to your adrenals
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.680]   to cause your adrenals to deploy
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.520]   both adrenaline, epinephrine, as well as cortisol.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.680]   That pathway is still intact, okay?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.880]   But that's a slightly slower pathway.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.960]   Here, I'm focusing on the neural pathways,
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.880]   some of which have only recently been discovered
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.080]   in the last five or 10 years,
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.900]   that work very, very fast to generate the sorts of arousal
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:57.440]   that are relevant to brain function and brain longevity.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.000]   Okay, nothing has changed in terms of the old story
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.560]   about how the brain impacts the adrenals,
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.720]   that's all still there,
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.120]   but here we're into the modern stuff.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.120]   And by the way, for those of you that are interested
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.880]   in things like psychosomatic disorders, trauma,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.480]   and how trauma can, quote unquote, be stored in the body,
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.040]   and not so much stored in the body,
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.440]   but how it can impact the body,
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.080]   and then how the body itself can impact the brain,
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.800]   this paper has also been used as support for the idea
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.060]   that indeed, those affective areas, those emotional areas,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.360]   those cognitive areas have a route
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.120]   by which they can communicate with the adrenal medulla
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.620]   to cause the release of adrenaline
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.280]   when we have specific thoughts.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.160]   It was always known that if we have specific thoughts,
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.560]   it can, quote unquote, stress us out,
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.320]   our heart rate can go up, et cetera.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.080]   This paper also provides a reasonable anatomical substrate
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.420]   for that phenomenon.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.600]   You know, I never want to make too much
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.020]   of any one single paper or finding,
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.160]   but I will say that after I read that paper
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.340]   from Strick and colleagues,
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.300]   and through some of the subsequent discussions
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.280]   about that paper that I overheard at meetings and so forth,
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.520]   it really made me think differently about exercise.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.320]   And now, anytime that I'm feeling tired,
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.000]   provided that I'm not chronically sleep-deprived
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.400]   or something of that sort,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.320]   I remind myself that if I start moving my body,
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.400]   in particular, if I engage core muscles,
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.000]   that was one of the key findings in that paper,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.280]   that the areas of the brain that control the core muscles,
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.600]   as well as do compound movements, I move multiple joints,
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.280]   I start, you know, warming up in a way
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.680]   that includes some, you know, maybe even just air squats,
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.540]   or some running in place, or jumping jacks,
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.140]   things of that sort,
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.420]   that the increase in energy that I'm perceiving is real.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.020]   It's based on the same neurochemical outputs
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.940]   that would occur had I gone into the gym,
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.060]   or to the run, or whatever workout with tons of energy,
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.140]   it would just have increased
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.900]   the level of adrenaline further.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.580]   So this idea that we can actually control our body
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.860]   with our mind, and to some extent, our mind with our body,
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.580]   that's absolutely true.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.500]   And this is one of the tools
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   that I find particularly useful
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.140]   anytime I want to overcome that wall of kind of resistance
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.700]   to not doing the physical exercise that I know I,
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.060]   and basically all of us, should be doing.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.420]   I'd like to take a quick break,
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:02.100]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.740]   I recently became a Function member
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.020]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.040]   to lab testing.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.940]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.940]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:13.560]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.420]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.220]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.500]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.900]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.660]   Function not only provides testing
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.760]   of over 100 biomarkers key to physical and mental health,
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.620]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.180]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.020]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.140]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.460]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.260]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.120]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.620]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.300]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.620]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.380]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.740]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.640]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.700]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.460]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.020]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.420]   is so important for health.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.220]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.140]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.620]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.520]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.040]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.960]   as well as how comprehensive and how actionable
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.360]   the tests are, that I recently joined their advisory board.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.600]   And I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.920]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.220]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.820]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.400]   but they're offering early access
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.640]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.920]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.200]   to get early access to Function.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.860]   Okay, so let's think just a little bit more
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.140]   about how the body communicates
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.140]   with the brain during exercise,
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.540]   both in order to understand the mechanisms
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:56.140]   by which exercise improves brain health and function,
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.480]   but also ways that we can leverage that
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.620]   to improve brain health and function by using exercise.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.260]   One of the more interesting and powerful
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.740]   and indeed surprising ways
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.900]   that the body communicates with the brain during exercise
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.220]   to improve brain health,
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.460]   and indeed our ability to remember things and to learn,
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.240]   is the way that our bones, our skeleton,
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.280]   when they're under loads, okay,
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.340]   when they experience mechanical stress,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.720]   not severe mechanical stress that would break them,
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.080]   but mechanical stress, they release hormones,
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   in particular, something called osteocalcin.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.000]   You might be thinking, wait, the bones release hormones?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.840]   Yes, your bones release hormones,
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.960]   one of which is called osteocalcin.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.120]   Osteocalcin is an incredible molecule.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.480]   Animal studies that were done
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.400]   mainly at Columbia School of Medicine,
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.060]   but later also at Columbia and elsewhere in humans
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.420]   have shown that osteocalcin
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.500]   is released from the bones during exercise,
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   both in mice and in humans,
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.500]   travels to the brain
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.660]   so it can cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.940]   and there it can encourage the growth of neurons
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.020]   and their connections within the hippocampus,
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.140]   an area of the brain that's vitally important
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.260]   for the encoding of new memories,
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.460]   and there are some data, not a ton,
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.320]   but there's some data which suggests that perhaps,
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.540]   I want to highlight, underscore, and boldface,
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.100]   perhaps, can increase the number of neurons
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.500]   in the so-called dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.100]   to allow even better capacity for memory.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.820]   Now, osteocalcin is therefore
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.160]   a really interesting molecule, right?
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.380]   Comes from bones, travels to the brain,
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.340]   improves functioning of the hippocampus,
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.620]   which is important for learning and memory.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.340]   That's amazing, and it does so in part
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.620]   through the actions of something
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.460]   that most of you perhaps have heard of,
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.520]   which is called BDNF, or brain-derived nootrophic factor.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.160]   Now, it's very important for us to understand
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.080]   that any time we hear about exercise
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.200]   increases a growth factor, and by the way,
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.680]   exercise increases brain-derived nootrophic factor,
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.880]   it increases growth factors
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.720]   that cause the growth of endothelial cells,
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.080]   so blood vessels, we'll talk more about that in a moment,
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.800]   and it increases nerve growth factors.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.020]   It's not just BDNF.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.020]   There are lots of different growth factors,
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:00.840]   a few of which, NGF and BDNF, act on neurons,
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.520]   and other growth factors that act
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.540]   on endothelial cells, vasculature.
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:08.920]   It seems that a lot of the effects of BDNF on the brain
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.120]   that are caused by doing exercise and that benefit us
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.800]   in terms of short and long-term memory,
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.360]   our ability to encode new things
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.160]   and remember them for long periods of time,
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.480]   to resist age-related degeneration,
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.040]   because that's the case, indeed,
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.960]   that our hippocampus decreases in volume over time
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.000]   as we age, just naturally, even in somebody
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.560]   that doesn't have Alzheimer's, dementia,
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.080]   and exercise can adjust the slope
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.040]   of that decline significantly,
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.400]   provided there's enough exercise
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.400]   and the appropriate exercise.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.160]   I don't think all, but many of the effects of BDNF
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.360]   appear to be mediated by osteocalcin.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.000]   What this means is that any exercise program
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.160]   that's designed not just to benefit our body,
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.600]   but also our brain health and performance,
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.720]   should do something to load the skeleton
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.800]   in some sort of impactful way
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.400]   that causes the release of osteocalcin.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.100]   Now, unfortunately, there has not been
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.820]   a systematic exploration of the specific types of exercise
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:10.160]   that best cause the release of osteocalcin in humans,
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.640]   but based on what we understand
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.560]   about how osteocalcin is made and released,
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.680]   it seems reasonable to assume and reasonable to employ
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.040]   some exercise within your weekly exercise
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.640]   that involves jumping of some sort,
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.900]   in particular, jumping where you have to control
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.720]   the eccentric or landing portion of that jump.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.920]   Now, I'm certainly not the first to talk about this.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.080]   It's been discussed in a different context,
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.580]   that is jumping and landing has been discussed
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.800]   in a different context,
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.240]   namely by Peter Atiyah and others,
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.600]   who have talked about the fact that as people age,
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.720]   one of the primary causes of mortality are the infections
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.920]   and the lack of mobility caused by falls
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.000]   that people generally have when they're going downstairs
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.640]   or down things, stepping down is a common source of falls,
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.800]   falls are a common source of breaking things,
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.620]   breaking things is a common source of inactivity
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.080]   and inactivity is a common source of infections
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.480]   and other things that lead to earlier mortality.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.600]   What this means for all of us, young, middle-aged, and old,
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.840]   is that we should include some form of jumping
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   in our weekly exercise.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.580]   Now, you could imagine doing that
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.440]   within your high-intensity interval training,
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.960]   provided you can do it safely and not get injured,
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.600]   but this is also a call for all of us to think about,
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.880]   including, say, some jumping rope,
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.920]   and if you're going to jump rope,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.880]   maybe not just jumping a centimeter off the ground
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.720]   to be able to just consistently skip, skip, skip, skip along,
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.860]   but maybe doing some high knees,
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.900]   maybe doing some double-unders if you can do those,
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.640]   perhaps doing some box jumps,
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.280]   so jumping off boxes at different heights,
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.780]   again, what you can do safely without getting injured,
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.880]   no doubt is going to provide load to the skeleton,
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.320]   I guess, unless you're doing it underwater in outer space,
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.840]   it's hard to imagine how it wouldn't,
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.240]   and that seems to me like the most direct way
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.820]   to employ this osteocalcin pathway.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.360]   This pathway from the bones to the brain
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.080]   and neurogenesis in the hippocampus,
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.540]   I do believe is likely to underlie
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.280]   a lot of the enhancement of learning and memory
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.560]   that's seen in terms of the chronic effects of exercise
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.120]   on brain health and brain function over time,
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.160]   that is, not just the things that exercise does via arousal
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.620]   in the minutes and hours after exercise,
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.140]   but the way that exercise can improve, literally,
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.240]   the size and structure of one
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.920]   of the most critical structures in our brain
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.040]   that's responsible for learning and memory, the hippocampus.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.520]   And of course, there are a lot of other ways
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.060]   that the body communicates with the brain,
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.320]   we definitely don't have time to go through all of them,
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   but it's worth thinking about a few of them logically,
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.160]   just in terms of listing them off
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.960]   and thinking about how they might communicate with the brain
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.260]   to improve brain health and longevity.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.600]   When you exercise, you utilize fuel differently,
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.880]   depending on whether or not you're relying on glycogen
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.240]   or fatty acids, and of course,
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.380]   it's going to depend on how long you've been exercising
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.420]   and the type of exercise and what you're using for fuel,
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.180]   literally the foods you eat, et cetera.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.100]   We don't have time to go into all of that, but get this,
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.100]   turns out that there are liver to brain neural pathways.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:08.420]   So your liver can communicate with neurons
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.340]   and other cells in your brain, including the glial cells,
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.940]   the cells that are important for regulating
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.460]   energy metabolism and a bunch of other things too.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.060]   Your liver can communicate to your brain,
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.360]   both through neural pathways
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.280]   and by releasing things into your bloodstream
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.640]   that then communicate to your brain,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.760]   oh, the body is using a different source of fuel.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.120]   It's been using different sources
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.440]   or combinations of fuels for the last 20 minutes.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.040]   Maybe you should adjust your brain state
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.800]   in order to be able to cope with that
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.520]   or in response to that.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.320]   And of course, there are other organs in the body
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.000]   that are communicating with the brain also.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.520]   Your diaphragm, for instance,
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.440]   is communicating with your brain through indirect pathways
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.160]   about how you're breathing during exercise.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.040]   And of course, your brain is controlling your diaphragm too
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.300]   via a number of stations,
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.780]   including the pathway that includes the phrenic nerve,
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.060]   which controls the diaphragm.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.780]   The point here is that once you start exercising,
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.100]   of course it has an impact on the organs in your body.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.820]   They change the way that they're functioning,
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.900]   your heart, your liver, your adrenals, your skeleton,
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.600]   literally your bones, and of course your muscles.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.660]   And they're releasing things that impact brain function
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.220]   either directly or indirectly.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.460]   Once you start thinking about exercise in that context,
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.340]   even if we don't parse each and every one
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.180]   of those pathways individually,
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.180]   you can start thinking about exercise
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.300]   as a multifactorial way of enhancing
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.060]   and changing brain activity
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.300]   so that it positions it to learn better
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.020]   in the subsequent hours and days,
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.100]   as well as modifying areas of the brain
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.040]   like the hippocampus by making certain brain areas
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.340]   literally bigger, more powerful
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.860]   at engaging the sorts of things that they do
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.160]   in the case of the hippocampus,
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.080]   learning, in the case of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.320]   context-dependent decision-making,
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.740]   updating strategies, these sorts of things.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.540]   And generally speaking, exercise causes the release
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.060]   of things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.340]   and nerve growth factor that enhance the health
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.260]   and stability of existing neuron connections.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.660]   And something that is very rarely,
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.420]   if ever, discussed publicly,
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.460]   not because it's some sort of secret
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.300]   that people want to keep,
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.400]   but I just don't hear it discussed,
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.820]   is that BDNF is an activity-dependent molecule.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.340]   It's a molecule that can serve to stabilize
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.360]   and enhance the growth of neurons,
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.340]   keep their connections in place, grow new connections,
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.100]   and it does so when neurons are active.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.220]   So the point is that BDNF has to be released
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.900]   in order for that to happen,
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.700]   but the release of BDNF itself is activity-dependent,
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.140]   and it acts best on neurons that are already active.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.540]   So if ever there was a mechanism
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.500]   that could explain why it is that people
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.740]   that exercise regularly seem to maintain healthier brains
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.020]   into later life, it's that one.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.480]   It's that BDNF is activity-dependent.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.700]   And when I say activity-dependent,
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.700]   I mean the electrical activity of neurons
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.420]   is what causes the release of BDNF.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.620]   And then once BDNF is released,
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:00.900]   it has the best opportunity to stabilize
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.020]   and enhance the growth of existing neurons
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:06.060]   if those other neurons are already active.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.940]   Now, if we were to list off all the different pathways
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.900]   and mechanisms by which exercise improves brain health
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.300]   and performance, it would be a list of probably,
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.020]   I don't know, somewhere between 40
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.260]   and 100 different molecular pathways,
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.700]   and probably, I don't know, somewhere between 12
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.840]   and 20 different anatomical pathways.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.340]   And we certainly don't have time for all that.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.700]   I don't think that's what you're interested in.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.100]   I've tried to just highlight some of the key ones today.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.140]   One additional one that I'd like to highlight
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.780]   is the lactate pathway,
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.060]   or the impact of lactate when we exercise.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.180]   This is getting discussed more and more these days
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.600]   on podcasts and elsewhere.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.220]   One interesting finding, for instance,
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:47.420]   is that lactate is what's produced
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.940]   when we exercise intensely.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.300]   Our muscles produce lactate,
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.760]   and lactate is a very powerful appetite suppressant.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.420]   Now, some of you may be saying,
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.340]   "When I exercise hard, I get really, really hungry."
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.720]   Well, that may be true,
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.540]   but it's also true that if you exercise really, really hard,
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:06.380]   and then you hydrate well, and you wait a little while,
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.820]   oftentimes that hunger will subside.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.220]   I'm not saying that you should starve yourself
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.180]   after exercise, fuel as needed for you.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.300]   If you're an intermittent faster, do that thing.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.620]   If you like to eat right after you exercise, do that.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.540]   Do what's best for you,
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.520]   but understand that lactate has powerful effects
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.740]   on our appetite, because why?
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.560]   Because lactate has powerful effects,
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.100]   not just on our body, but on our brain.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.820]   And it is able to impact the activity of neurons
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.700]   in our so-called hypothalamus,
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.520]   little marble-sized region above the roof of our mouth,
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.340]   that contains some of the neurons
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:40.500]   that control our appetite and our degree of satiety.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.740]   So the point here is that lactate
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.180]   is a molecule produced in the body
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.740]   that can actually signal to the brain.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.680]   Most of you perhaps have heard
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.260]   that lactate can be used as a fuel for neurons.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:53.540]   During exercise, lactate is the preferred fuel for neurons
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.740]   under most circumstances,
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.660]   especially under circumstances of intense exercise,
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.140]   that spares glucose for other things,
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.860]   including for cognitive work later on.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.620]   This is perhaps one of the reasons
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.980]   why when people do intense exercise,
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.420]   provided it's not too long and too intense,
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.980]   and then you go to learn something,
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.060]   you have enhanced focus.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.420]   It's because of the arousal
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.900]   we've been talking about all along today,
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.580]   but it's also because we believe that there's glucose,
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.120]   there's fuel that's been spared
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.580]   that then can be used by the neurons
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.180]   because during the exercise,
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.820]   you weren't using quite as much glucose,
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.340]   you were using lactate.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.900]   Now, lactate is also a stimulus
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.500]   for something called the blood-brain barrier,
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.140]   which is made up of endothelial cells,
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.540]   specialized endothelial cells that act as a barrier
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.700]   so that certain things, in particular large molecules,
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.620]   can't cross from the body into the brain.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.180]   Lactate stimulates the release
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.420]   of something called VEGF, V-G-E-F,
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:47.300]   which is basically an endothelial growth factor
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.380]   that promotes the stability and growth
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.700]   of the blood-brain barrier.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.340]   This is very important in the context
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.820]   of brain health and longevity,
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.460]   and longevity in particular,
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.620]   because one of the major features
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.740]   of age-related cognitive decline,
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.620]   and one that's greatly exacerbated in Alzheimer's,
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.660]   is a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.860]   So the integrity, the structure and function
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.180]   of the blood-brain barrier
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.420]   is something that's very important
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.100]   and related to brain health.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.940]   An exercise that's intense enough to produce lactate
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.260]   causes the increase in VEGF
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.220]   that acts on and within the endothelial cells
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.220]   to improve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.300]   And because I mentioned the astrocytes earlier,
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.000]   and because I did my postdoc with somebody
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.220]   that was sort of famous
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.380]   for popularizing the study of astrocytes
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.020]   when no one else wanted to study the astrocytes,
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.520]   now everybody studies the astrocytes.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.780]   But I have to mention something about astrocytes,
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.140]   which, no, they're not just a support cell.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.620]   Certain types of cells in the brain are called glia.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.980]   The glia come in multiple forms, oligodendrocytes,
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.260]   in the periphery, they're called Schwann cells,
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.620]   but then you also have astrocytes.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.360]   And astrocytes sit around the synapse,
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.720]   they ensheathe synapses.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.440]   Remember, synapses are the communication points
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.280]   between neurons.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.900]   And the astrocytes are beautifully positioned
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.760]   to read out the amount of activity
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.300]   that's occurring between neurons
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.400]   and produce fuel for those neurons.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.200]   So the astrocytes mainly use glucose for fuel,
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.220]   but they can produce lactate.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.040]   So again, we have this activity-dependent phenomenon.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.240]   That is, when certain neurons are very, very active,
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.460]   the astrocytes are able to produce more lactate,
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.060]   the neurons can use lactate, spares glucose,
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.400]   and a bunch of great things happen.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.340]   When I say great things happen,
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.920]   I mean in the context of the ways
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.040]   that exercise can improve brain function,
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.820]   because those elevated levels of lactate
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.540]   in turn also increase BDNF.
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.880]   We already talked about the blood-brain barrier.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.520]   Basically, the muscles producing lactate is terrific,
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.020]   but the astrocytes producing lactate
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.560]   for the neurons to feed on is also terrific
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.880]   because lactate can be used as a fuel
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.200]   and it triggers all these downstream
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.640]   or subsequent mechanisms, including BDNF.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.520]   So basically what we're talking about
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.840]   is the lots and lots of ways
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.200]   that exercise improves brain health
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.480]   in the long-term, BDNF, brain plasticity,
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.440]   stability of synapses, and so forth.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.680]   Maybe even new neurons.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.520]   Maybe.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.900]   Not a lot of evidence for that in humans yet, frankly,
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.640]   but maybe.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.060]   And exercise can improve brain function in the short-term
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.040]   through mechanisms of arousal,
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.280]   but also through alternate fuel usage,
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.000]   such as lactate from the body
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.040]   and from cells within the brain
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.740]   that we call the astrocytes,
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.160]   and the release of all sorts of other things.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.440]   IGF-1 to promote more vasculature,
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.180]   and on and on and on.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.840]   It's really quite beautiful.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.080]   The sort of wavefront of molecules and neural pathways
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.480]   that's initiated when we exercise,
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.920]   provided we exercise intensely enough.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.200]   So this is a double and triple call
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.860]   for including at least some high-intensity interval training,
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.680]   VO2 max-type training each week,
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.760]   as well as doing resistance training.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.920]   And of course, the long-duration cardiovascular training,
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.560]   the sort of 30 or 45 or 60-minute
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.520]   or maybe even two-hour zone two type stuff.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.360]   You can look up zone two,
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.480]   but it's basically a level of cardiovascular training
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.200]   that still allows you to talk,
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.760]   but were you to go any more intensely,
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.920]   you wouldn't be able to complete sentences.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.720]   That zone two training, of course,
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.680]   is going to be very powerful for the health and integrity
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.440]   of the cardiovascular system
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   that's going to allow for the delivery
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.920]   of all these molecules.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.360]   And of course, the delivery of blood flow itself
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.620]   to the brain, because cerebral blood flow
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.680]   is central to brain function.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.720]   Okay, so if you're right at the threshold
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.820]   of about to be overwhelmed
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.340]   by the number of different mechanisms
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.400]   by which exercise improves brain function
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.960]   and health, we're not going to add any more mechanisms.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.900]   We are, however, going to talk about the practical steps
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.320]   that you can take to make sure
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.240]   that you're getting the most brain benefits
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.520]   from your exercise.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.320]   Based on what we've talked about so far,
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.720]   as well as a broad survey of the literature,
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.560]   and again, it is a big literature,
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.840]   here are the four things that I believe everyone
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.360]   should be doing every single week
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.520]   in terms of their exercise program.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.160]   Now, we've talked a lot about exercise
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.840]   on this podcast before.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.520]   I can summarize the very, very top contour
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.720]   of what my takeaway is from the literature
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.320]   and from discussions with experts
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.140]   such as Dr. Andy Galpin and others,
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.800]   which is, I believe that everybody should include
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.760]   both resistance training, could be body weight,
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.360]   free weights, machines, some combination of those,
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.080]   as well as cardiovascular training each week.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.520]   And that the cardiovascular training
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.120]   should include both high intensity interval training
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.360]   at least once per week and some so-called
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.720]   long, slow distance training
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   or zone two type training each week.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.440]   So presumably most of you are doing some form of that.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.680]   So maybe you're doing more cardio than resistance training.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.100]   Maybe you're doing more resistance training than cardio.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.960]   If you're interested in a zero cost program
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.460]   where you can start to sculpt out a idealized program
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.560]   for you, but you want to start
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.200]   with a kind of general template,
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.840]   we have a newsletter that you can access
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.680]   at hubermanlab.com, zero cost.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.260]   You don't even have to sign up to access it.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.200]   Although if you want to sign up for the newsletter,
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.200]   that could be valuable to you too.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.340]   Completely zero cost.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.000]   You can go to hubermanlab.com, go to newsletter,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.880]   scroll down to foundational fitness protocol.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.080]   It describes the program that I've been following
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.840]   essentially for 30 plus years.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.360]   And again, it's about three cardiovascular training sessions
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.960]   per week, three resistance training sessions per week.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.160]   The cardiovascular training ranges in time
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.820]   from about 12 minutes and then a longer 60 minute session.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.200]   The resistance training is generally 45 to 75 minutes.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.760]   So on average, about an hour.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.040]   And it might sound like a lot,
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.840]   but when you look at that foundational fitness protocol,
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.360]   what you realize is that some of the workouts
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.240]   are really, really short.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.720]   Some of them are a little bit longer.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.520]   None of them are longer than an hour.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.040]   So it's pretty reasonable to do.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.560]   And I certainly did it while working, well, to be frank,
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.080]   extremely long hours for many, many years.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.660]   So provided your sleep is intact
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.200]   and other areas of your life are dialed in with stress,
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.560]   et cetera, it should be doable for most everybody,
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.280]   but modify it according to what you need.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.080]   Or if you're doing something completely different,
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.400]   more power to you.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.760]   I just want you to know that's available
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.900]   as a zero cost resource if you want to check it out.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.040]   With all of that said,
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.800]   whatever exercise you happen to be doing
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.240]   or you happen to be planning,
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.840]   I do believe it should include four things specifically
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.000]   to improve brain health and performance.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.820]   Although these four things will also benefit you
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.540]   at the level of your bodily health.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.800]   No doubt.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.520]   The first thing is to include at least one workout per week
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.340]   that is of a long, slow distance nature.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.640]   So zone two type cardio,
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.840]   maybe you get a little bit up into zone three,
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.060]   but basically jogging, swimming, rowing,
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.600]   any activity that you can carry out consistently
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.020]   for 45 to 75 minutes without getting injured, right?
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.380]   People always say, well, do I have to run?
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.680]   No, if you don't like running
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.240]   and running's too hard on your body,
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.700]   or you'll get injured, then do something else.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.900]   Maybe you do the rower, maybe you ride a stationary bike,
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.960]   maybe you ride a road bike.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:46.660]   For me, it's jogging generally,
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.280]   or hiking with a weight vest.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.540]   Those are the things that I enjoy
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.260]   and that I can do without getting injured.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:54.200]   But for other people, it's a different exercise.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.460]   But at least one long, slow distance training session
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.140]   per week is going to be very beneficial for brain health
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.560]   because of the way that it impacts cerebral blood flow
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.140]   and to filial health and basically the way
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:08.220]   that cardiovascular health improves brain function
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:11.800]   at the level of blood flow, fuel delivery, et cetera.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.300]   The second thing is to include
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.900]   at least one workout per week
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:19.020]   that's of the so-called high-intensity interval training type.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.780]   Now, there are a lot of different types
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.320]   of high-intensity interval training out there.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.260]   In fact, Dr. Andy Galpin says, you know,
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.420]   we'll hear about say like the four-by-four-by-four protocol,
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.500]   right, four minutes of going as hard as you can
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.180]   for four minutes, basically where there's no variation
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.940]   in the intensity through that whole four minutes.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.480]   You're going hard the whole four minutes,
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.720]   but only as hard as you can for the entire four minutes,
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.940]   then resting four minutes,
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.940]   and then repeating that four-by-four cycle four times.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:46.940]   Okay, so that's one way to do it.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.900]   But Dr. Andy Galpin would be the first to tell you
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.960]   that you probably also get great results
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.480]   from a three-by-three-by-four type of workout
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.900]   or a six-by-six-by-six type of workout.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.740]   Although for many people,
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:00.780]   that's going to be too much and too intense.
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.940]   Or if you're me and you prefer
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.580]   a high-intensity interval training session
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.720]   that is more like a two minutes on,
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.500]   as hard as you can go for two minutes,
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.740]   and then rest for say three to four minutes,
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.380]   and then repeat maybe four times, maybe five times,
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.700]   well, then do that.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.420]   I have a high-intensity interval training session
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.840]   that I do when I'm very limited on time,
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.700]   which involves getting on the Airdyne bike.
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.100]   They sometimes call it the assault bike.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.720]   There's a lot of resistance, has that fan,
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.260]   which I always thought was to cool me off.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:28.900]   But then, you know, once I actually got on one
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.500]   and started riding,
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.180]   I realized that that's to provide resistance.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.920]   So, but basically, if I'm limited on time,
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.060]   I'll hop on there.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.200]   I'll pedal for about a minute or two, just kind of warm up.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.580]   And then I'll go all out for a minute, rest for 30 seconds,
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:44.080]   all out for a minute, rest for 30 seconds.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.500]   The first three or four of those cycles,
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.660]   feeling pretty good.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:51.580]   By the seventh and eighth one, I'm, you know, I'm praying.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.340]   And generally, when one finishes that type of workout,
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.740]   your heart rate is very, very elevated.
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.360]   Now, I don't tend to track my heart rate during exercise.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.660]   Perhaps I should, but I don't like to get, you know,
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.120]   too weighed down with technology when I exercise.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.220]   I like to go more on feel, that's just me.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:12.080]   I find that my heart rate is extremely high
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.820]   right as I get off that thing.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.420]   But, you know, five minutes later, it's back to baseline.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.700]   And I certainly feel energized after doing that
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.340]   to go do some cognitive work, to shower up
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.600]   and to head to work, that sort of thing.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.980]   So, pick a high-intensity interval training session
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   that you can do at least once per week,
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.260]   and that works for you.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.160]   And again, it's really important to pick a form
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.620]   of exercise for the high-intensity interval training
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.540]   that you can do without getting injured.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.780]   This is so important.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.860]   You know, one way to really limit your brain health
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.540]   and bodily health is to get injured
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.540]   and to not be able to exercise.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.180]   In a few minutes, I'll tell you about what happens
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:47.240]   when you don't exercise for a certain duration
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.240]   and how that negatively impacts your brain health.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.860]   And it's not that long before that starts to happen.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:56.860]   But in the meantime, the first was long, slow distance,
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.660]   or so-called zone two.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:01.200]   So, we could call that LSD, not the psychedelic,
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.080]   but long, slow distance exercise.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.700]   Second was high-intensity interval training,
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.240]   or H-I-I-T, or HIT.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.200]   The third would be TUT, T-U-T, time under tension.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.600]   If you're doing resistance training,
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.040]   and I do believe everybody should be doing
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.240]   resistance training, there are a near infinite number
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.840]   of different ways to do resistance training,
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.160]   as you well know.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.760]   You can move the weight ballistically,
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.200]   you can control the eccentric,
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.000]   you can do any number of different things.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.100]   But some proportion of the exercises that you do
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.480]   during your resistance training, during the week,
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.380]   should include time under tension training,
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.480]   where you're really emphasizing the contraction
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.040]   of the muscles, the slow lowering of the weight,
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.840]   as well as the lifting of the weight,
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.520]   contracting the muscles as hard as you can.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.880]   And this is really to emphasize
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.040]   the nerve to muscle pathways and the way
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.920]   that time under tension promotes the release of things
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.180]   from muscles into the bloodstream
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.280]   that can positively impact the brain,
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.760]   as well as the way that focusing your brain on exercises
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.800]   such that you're isolating muscles,
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.360]   or even if you're not doing a so-called isolation exercise,
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.820]   maybe you're doing a compound exercise,
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.800]   like a dip or a squat or a deadlift,
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.680]   but that really concentrating on the muscles
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.600]   that are supposed to be managing the work
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.780]   and not just moving the weight,
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.040]   but challenging the muscles, this is a very important thing,
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.120]   challenging the muscles, using the weight,
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.440]   not lifting weights or moving weights.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.480]   By focusing on time under tension,
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.960]   you will of course get benefits as it relates
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.360]   to hypertrophy and strength increases,
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.100]   in particular hypertrophy.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:28.440]   Doing time under tension requires you to engage the,
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.160]   what we call the upper motor neuron to lower motor neuron,
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.560]   you have motor neurons in your cortex,
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.360]   you also have motor neurons in your spinal cord,
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.480]   those pathways that then go out to the muscles
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.320]   and control the muscles in very deliberate ways.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.760]   And time under tension training is very beneficial
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.800]   for the deployment of the molecules
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.480]   that work both within the body,
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.080]   but also within the brain to support brain health
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.940]   and function both in the short-term
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:55.000]   and most particularly in the long-term.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.220]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.960]   and thank one of our sponsors, Maui Nui Venison.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.380]   Maui Nui Venison is 100% wild harvested venison
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.680]   from the island of Maui,
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.280]   and it is the most nutrient dense
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.380]   and delicious red meat available.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.040]   I've spoken before on this podcast
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.320]   about the fact that most of us should be consuming
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.120]   about one gram of quality protein
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.400]   per pound of body weight every day.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   That protein provides critical building blocks
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.000]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.920]   but it also promotes overall health,
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.560]   given the importance of muscle tissue as an organ.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.400]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.200]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.440]   One of the key things, however,
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.720]   is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.000]   without ingesting excess calories.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.880]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.500]   per calorie ratio,
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500]   so that getting one gram of quality protein
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.540]   per pound of body weight is both easy
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:46.400]   and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.680]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.000]   They have venison steaks,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.200]   ground venison and venison bone broth.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.040]   I personally like all of those.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.400]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.600]   pretty much every day,
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.480]   and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.120]   And if you're traveling a lot or you're simply on the go,
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.800]   they have Maui Nui Venison sticks,
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.000]   which have 10 grams of protein per stick
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.680]   at just 55 calories, and they're extremely convenient.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.440]   You can pretty much take them anywhere.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.140]   Responsible population management
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.360]   of the access to your on the island of Maui
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.520]   means they cannot go beyond a particular harvest capacity.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.080]   Signing up for a membership is therefore the best way
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.880]   to ensure access to their high quality meat.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.840]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.440]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.240]   to get 20% off your membership or first order.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.240]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.680]   Okay, so we have long, slow distance,
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.360]   high intensity interval training,
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.920]   and some degree of time under tension training
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.160]   with resistance training.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.700]   You might be asking how many sets, what proportion?
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.780]   That depends on your goals, right?
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.120]   If you're a power lifter and you're trying
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.640]   to lift bigger weights,
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.560]   or you simply want to get stronger,
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.480]   not going to devote a lot of your training
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.880]   to time under tension, most likely.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.520]   You're going to be focusing mostly on the performance
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.200]   of those lifts to move more weight.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.160]   But in my case, what I do, just for sake of example,
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160]   again, this is just what I happen to do,
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.060]   is I tend to make a full third of my resistance training
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.580]   just focused on time under tension.
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:14.900]   So if I do two exercises,
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.220]   typically the first exercise is a compound exercise.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.040]   So if it's a shoulder press, for instance,
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.100]   I'll do a couple of warmup sets, and then the work sets.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.860]   I try and move the weight.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.340]   And generally I tend to work pretty heavy in the,
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:28.380]   for me, heavy for me, in the four to eight repetition range.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.720]   I'll try and move the weight as quickly as I can
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.200]   on the concentric phase, the lifting phase,
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.940]   and then at least twice as slow on the lowering phase.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.460]   And then I pause while keeping the muscles under tension.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.060]   I never really set the weight down at all during a set,
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.700]   if I'm doing my job, that is.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:46.340]   And then the second exercise that I do,
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:48.980]   I really focus even more on time under tension.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.960]   So whether or not it's a compound exercise
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.660]   or an isolation exercise, again, compound exercise,
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.860]   multiple joints moving, isolation exercise,
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.500]   single joints moving, I'll really concentrate
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.840]   on keeping the muscle under tension the entire time.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.220]   In fact, I'll lift the weight off the stack
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:05.100]   if it's a machine, or if it's a free weight,
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.260]   just a little bit, engage the muscles
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:10.340]   that I'm trying to activate or train,
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:13.520]   and then keep it under tension throughout the concentric,
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.980]   the contraction, and the lowering of that weight,
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.660]   and then never actually set it down
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.180]   until the end of the set,
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.380]   AKA increasing the time under tension.
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.100]   And then the fourth category of exercise
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.720]   that I believe everybody should include
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.380]   in their existing workouts, or add
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.460]   if you're not currently working out,
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:36.700]   is some sort of explosive jumping and/or eccentric landing.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.920]   Now, the explosive jumping with eccentric landing,
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.620]   you could do on a mat, right?
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:43.900]   Most people won't do it on concrete
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.420]   because they're worried about impact, that sort of thing.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.700]   But let's say you have some mats,
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.540]   or you're on a lawn, or you're on dirt,
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:53.260]   or you're jumping up onto a box as high as you can,
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.460]   and then jumping down and controlling the eccentric portion.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.900]   Again, pick something that you can do safely,
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.140]   progress slowly, right?
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.060]   If you're going to jump up and off boxes,
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.500]   you want to start with low boxes.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.940]   I know that many of you can jump quite high,
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.700]   and I'm not one of those people,
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.340]   but if you can jump quite high,
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.720]   and then you're going to jump off that box,
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.020]   and you're going to do this as a new thing,
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.180]   you'll notice that anytime you add eccentric training
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.940]   to your workout regimen,
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.780]   it tends to increase soreness a lot.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.100]   And often people get injured
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.980]   by including a new form of movement,
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:24.540]   in particular, a form of movement that you can fall,
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.140]   and/or not just falling,
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.500]   but by including a lot of eccentric movements
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.460]   that they hadn't been doing previously.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.240]   Again, be really safe about this,
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.260]   but that loading of the skeleton through eccentric movement
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:39.240]   and controlling the descent, super important,
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.740]   not just for your body, not just to avoid falls,
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.620]   not just to improve coordination
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.020]   and a bunch of other great things,
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:48.180]   but also to get that release of osteocalcin,
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.820]   the improvements in BDNF,
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.360]   brain performance, brain health, and so on.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.520]   And I'm guessing that most of you
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.340]   can probably incorporate these four things,
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.080]   long, slow distance, high-intensity interval training,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.900]   some deliberate time under tension training
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.060]   during your resistance training,
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.240]   again, could be done with body weight,
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.460]   doesn't have to even be done with machines or free weights,
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:08.400]   as well as some explosive and eccentric control training
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.060]   without adding any time to your existing workout regimen,
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.380]   simply by incorporating it
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.600]   into whatever workouts you happen to already be doing.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.300]   And the explosive eccentric control training
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:22.020]   could be done, frankly, at the end of a run,
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.580]   you could do it at the end of your zone two day,
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.020]   you could do it on the end of a hit day,
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.980]   whenever you do it and however you do it,
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:29.060]   just try not to get injured,
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.560]   that's the most important thing.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.400]   Why?
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.020]   Well, it turns out if you get injured, you can't exercise.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.980]   Sometimes you can, and it's good to continue exercising
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   provided you're not aggravating that injury,
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:40.540]   but a lot of times you can't.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.720]   And there are actually studies
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.780]   of how quickly your brain starts to suffer
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:45.920]   if you don't exercise.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.580]   Now, most of these studies have been done
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:50.620]   on very experienced athletes,
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:52.140]   or people that are exercising a lot
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.420]   and then are forced to detrain or stop training completely.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.420]   And in some of these studies,
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.140]   they've done this independent of anything else.
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:01.300]   It's not like these people got sick from a cold or flu
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.420]   and then had to stop training.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:04.780]   They'll just have them train a lot and then stop training
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.420]   and then start to look at some of the effects
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:07.740]   that occur within the brain.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.660]   And the major thing that I was able to extract
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.120]   from that literature is that after about 10 days
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.880]   of not doing any training,
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.800]   that is no cardiovascular training, no resistance training,
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.080]   you start to see significant decrements
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.200]   in brain oxygenation levels,
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.480]   as well as some other markers
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:24.720]   that are indicative of brain health,
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.000]   or that would be indicative of brain health
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.640]   if they were to continue.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.280]   So if you haven't been training at all
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.640]   for a long period of time, your brain is suffering.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.120]   The good news is you can start benefiting your brain
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.720]   very quickly by exercising.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.560]   Check out the foundational fitness protocol
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.260]   that involves a ramp up or warming kind of phase,
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.140]   'cause you don't want to jump into something whole hog
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.700]   if you haven't been doing it at all,
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.260]   if you haven't been exercising at all.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.900]   You know, forget what you did in high school.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.940]   By the way, folks, anytime people tell you,
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.980]   "Back in the day I was so fit,"
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.620]   that's not the way to think about it.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.460]   It's about today and what you're going to do today
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.660]   and forward, okay?
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:00.060]   The past is great, it tells you you had a capacity,
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.220]   but you really just want to take where you are now
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.580]   and try and improve where you are now going forward, okay?
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.300]   The past is the past.
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.920]   So how fit you were in high school or in junior high school
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.040]   or when you were in the kindergarten class,
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.360]   you were the first one to make it around
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.220]   to get the blocks and the cookie in the milk first,
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.400]   like, awesome.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.840]   But if you're going to start up having not exercised
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.920]   in a long, long time, think about what you can do now
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.800]   so you don't get injured.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.160]   Because when you get injured, you can't exercise.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.420]   And when you don't exercise for 10 days or more,
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.960]   that's when you start to see decrements in brain health.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.680]   So if you're not exercising now,
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.320]   it's a great time to get to it.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.980]   If you are exercising now and you have to take a week off
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.000]   because of some sort of illness or injury
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   or family event or stress, look, don't obsess over that.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.760]   Don't miss out on some of the key things of life
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.520]   or make yourself sicker by exercising.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.360]   Please, please, please don't come to the gym sick, okay?
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.120]   I did a whole episode on colds and flus.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.200]   And anytime people are coughing and sneezing
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.640]   and they tell you they're not contagious,
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.500]   that's completely unsubstantiated by the scientific data.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.640]   Please don't come to the gym sick.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.820]   So if you had to take a week off, you'll be fine.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.800]   You'll be fine.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800]   You'll probably come back stronger in the end.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.560]   Take a couple of days and ramp back up.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.100]   But after about 10 days, your brain health starts to suffer.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.780]   So that's an important number to keep in mind.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.020]   Okay, so multiple times throughout today's discussion,
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.940]   we've been talking about how exercise increases arousal,
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.260]   arousal improves brain function.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:18.140]   That's true.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.140]   You know what's also true?
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.580]   What's also true is that exercise improves brain health
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:23.820]   in the long-term.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.060]   Yes, through the deployment of things like BDNF.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.500]   Yes, through the deployment of things like osteocalcin
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.060]   and on and on.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.100]   But it also does so by improving your sleep.
[01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.680]   There are now many, many studies showing
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.880]   that sleep is the thing that mediates many, not all,
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.400]   but many of the positive effects of exercise
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.920]   on brain performance and long-term brain health.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.020]   So what this means is that you have to make sure
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.740]   that you're getting adequate amounts of sleep.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:52.120]   It's not sufficient just to exercise.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.260]   You need to get proper sleep.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.200]   And I've done multiple episodes
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.840]   on how to optimize your sleep, how to improve your sleep,
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.280]   how to deal with insomnia, shift work.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.160]   If you want to learn about any and all of that,
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.320]   either from podcasts or from our newsletter,
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.280]   go to hubermanlab.com, put sleep into the search function,
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.240]   and it will take you to the episodes
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.820]   and the newsletters that discuss that.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:15.720]   In addition, if you have a specific issue with sleep,
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.700]   like you're doing shift work or you're jet lagged,
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:21.320]   or you are suffering from middle of the night waking
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.700]   or trouble shifting your schedule
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.760]   because you want to become an early riser,
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.880]   put those terms into the search function.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.480]   It will take you to the specific timestamps
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.880]   in those episodes so that you don't have to listen
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.240]   to the entire episodes,
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.560]   because I realized that some of them are quite long.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.040]   And of course, there's the newsletter on sleep
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.580]   that lists off the various things that you should
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.320]   and can be doing to improve your sleep,
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.760]   no matter how well you happen to be sleeping now.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.200]   But tons and tons of zero cost resources there
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:51.300]   in PDF form, in podcast form, and on and on.
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.880]   We also did the six episode series on sleep
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.680]   with Dr. Matthew Walker, one of the world's experts in sleep.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.620]   So that's also there.
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.160]   So you can find all that there.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.560]   One question I get a lot is,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:06.660]   let's say I don't sleep that well, should I exercise?
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:09.000]   Well, the short answer is yes,
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.200]   provided that it was just one night of poor sleep.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.500]   In fact, there are studies showing
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.120]   that if you're slightly sleep deprived,
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.440]   meaning one night's poor sleep.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.200]   So most people need somewhere between six
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.960]   and nine hours of sleep, varies by person,
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.200]   varies by age, varies by time of year, and so on,
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.900]   all discussed in that series with Matt Walker.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.440]   Most people need six to nine hours,
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.920]   but let's say you normally get eight
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.460]   or you normally get seven,
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:36.240]   but you're down two hours on sleep for whatever reason.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.120]   Should you exercise the next morning?
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.040]   The short answer is yes,
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.280]   provided it was just one night of poor sleep.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:45.520]   It turns out that exercising after a poor night's sleep
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.760]   can help offset some of the negative effects
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.200]   of sleep deprivation on what?
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.320]   On brain performance and health.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.940]   Now, you don't wanna get into a habit of this.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.640]   You don't wanna get into a habit of using exercise
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.920]   as a way to compensate for sleep loss.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.240]   So if you don't sleep well for one night,
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.520]   exercise is a great way to offset
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.560]   that sleep loss effect on the brain
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.500]   or that would otherwise affect the brain.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.600]   You can compensate for it by doing some exercise.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.640]   Keep in mind, you want to exercise in a way
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.720]   that's not too intense
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.280]   because you can drive your immune system down
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.160]   and be more vulnerable to infections.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.000]   That's certainly the case after a poor night's sleep.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.320]   You also wanna be really careful
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.980]   with what you do for that exercise
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.880]   in terms of your coordinated movement.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.760]   It's much easier to get injured
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:26.760]   when you're sleep deprived.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.360]   In fact, there's a really nice set of studies.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.400]   Lane Norton's talked about this elsewhere,
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.280]   that the relationship between sleep
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.400]   or I should say sleep deprivation and injury
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   is a strong one.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.440]   And the relationship between sleep loss and pain
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.960]   and failure to recover from injury is also a strong one.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.960]   The direct point being, if you're slightly sleep deprived,
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.160]   sure, go ahead and exercise.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.360]   That will actually help you offset
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.880]   some of the negative effects of that sleep deprivation,
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.440]   but you wanna be careful how you exercise
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.560]   so you don't get sick and you don't get injured.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.240]   So you can keep in mind that if you're having trouble
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.740]   sleeping or even if you're a great sleeper already,
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.700]   getting exercise will further improve
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.120]   the architecture of your sleep.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.560]   In fact, there's some evidence
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.280]   that doing high intensity interval training
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.320]   can improve the amount of deep slow wave sleep that you get.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.600]   And there's some additional data showing
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.360]   that if you do high intensity training early in the day,
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.080]   and that's combined with a bunch of other things
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.760]   that stimulate autonomic arousal.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.720]   So here we are again at autonomic arousal.
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.760]   Things like caffeine, if that's in your program,
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.400]   you don't have to drink caffeine.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.920]   Things like getting bright light in your eyes
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.520]   early in the day, definitely do that.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.120]   Don't stare at the sun or any light so bright
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.800]   that it's dangerous or painful to look at,
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.160]   but certainly get bright light in your eyes.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.360]   All those things that increase autonomic arousal
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.600]   early in the day can also help improve the amount
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.600]   and the quality of sleep that you get at night,
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.880]   in particular, rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.140]   which is so critical for learning and memory.
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.880]   In fact, there's something called the first night effect,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.200]   which is the amount and quality of rapid eye movement sleep
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.400]   that you get on the first night
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.920]   after trying to learn something,
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.000]   powerfully dictates whether or not you actually learn
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.960]   and remember that thing.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.400]   Because as you recall, learning and memory,
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.800]   neuroplasticity is a two-step process.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.480]   You need to be focused and alert
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.600]   during the encoding phase, during the learning,
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.440]   but it's in states of deep rest, sleep in particular,
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.000]   but also non-sleep deep rest.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.320]   But rapid eye movement sleep is the kind of king
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.440]   of reshaping your brain connections for the better,
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.480]   unloading the emotional load of experiences
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.480]   that were troubling.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.640]   That happens during rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.200]   Just a little bit of REM deprivation,
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.080]   rapid eye movement sleep deprivation
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:23.600]   will make you more emotional
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.280]   and will make the painful experiences
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:28.000]   of recent and distant past also more painful.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.240]   Get more rapid eye movement sleep if you can.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.760]   It also consolidates learning of things
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.400]   that you want to remember.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.680]   Again, exercise early in the day,
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.620]   in particular, high intensity exercise
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:39.480]   combined with some of the other things we just discussed,
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.160]   terrific way to improve the amount and quality of sleep
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.440]   that you get at night.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.280]   And of course, all of that geysers up to what?
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.040]   Better brain health and performance in the short-term
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.160]   and in the long-term.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.060]   Okay, so I listed off the four types of training
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.500]   that you absolutely want to include
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.920]   in your exercise regimen
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.180]   if improving your brain health and performance
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.060]   is one of your goals.
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:01.360]   And obviously that should be one of your goals.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.580]   Your brain is your central command center
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.840]   for your entire brain, but also your body.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.680]   There's a fifth category of exercise
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.780]   that everyone should include
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:15.480]   if one's goal is to have a better and more resilient
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:18.920]   and indeed a better performing brain
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.760]   compared to your age match controls.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:23.040]   And to be direct, that fifth category
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.840]   is the one that you absolutely don't want to do.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:27.920]   What do I mean by that?
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.640]   Well, there's an absolutely beautiful literature
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.640]   about a brain area.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.320]   I've talked a little bit about this before
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.720]   in our episode about tenacity and willpower.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.020]   I've talked about it on a few other podcasts as well.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.500]   It came up during the podcast episode
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.800]   that I did with the one and only David Goggins.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.360]   And that brain area is the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.240]   The anterior mid-cingulate cortex very briefly
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.520]   is a brain area that is powerfully engaged
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:58.800]   when we lean into challenges, including physical challenges,
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.980]   but also mental challenges, emotional challenges.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:06.200]   And we get that, I'm going to push through tenacity
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.080]   and engaging our willpower.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.000]   Now it's remarkable to think about this brain area.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.800]   This is a brain area, mind you,
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.400]   that when my colleague at Stanford, Joe Parvizzi,
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.720]   putting a little electrode into,
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.000]   he was doing this for other reasons
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.320]   related to important neurosurgeries that patients needed
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.920]   and stimulated that particular brain area,
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.680]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.880]   People reported immediately feeling
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.160]   as if there was some impending challenge,
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.480]   but that they were going to lean into that challenge.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.520]   Remarkable.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.000]   This brain area has intense connectivity
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.880]   with many, many other brain areas.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.000]   The dopaminergic system, the so-called arousal system.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.520]   So multiple brain areas involved in arousal.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.200]   Areas of the brain that are involved in learning.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.400]   Areas of the brain that are involved in stress.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.720]   Areas of the brain that are involved in
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.120]   lots and lots of different things.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.040]   It's a major hub for inputs from other brain areas
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.520]   and outputs to other brain areas.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.080]   But here's what's most remarkable
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.660]   about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:01.200]   There's a category of humans referred to as super-agers.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.560]   Super-agers are people that defy the aging process,
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.320]   at least at the level of cognition.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.200]   They maintain the volume of certain brain areas
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.880]   well into older age when their age match counterparts
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.660]   are losing the same brain areas.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:18.760]   Meaning people in their 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.600]   have brain areas that are shrinking.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.160]   Even in cases where people don't have Alzheimer's dementia,
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.520]   areas of the brain are shrinking.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.920]   Super-agers are people that maintain the healthy
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.760]   full volume of these brain areas.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.160]   And indeed, in some cases, the volume,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.360]   the size of these brain areas
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.360]   continues to increase into their later years.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.160]   One of the brain areas that maintains
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.480]   or increases volume in these super-agers
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.680]   is the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.720]   And there aren't many other brain areas that do that.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.080]   The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is the main site
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.640]   that can be tacked to this phenomenon of super-aging.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.200]   Now, super-aging and super-agers is a bit of a misnomer
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.300]   because what's happening in these people is
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.820]   they're not just holding onto the volume
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.720]   of their anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.280]   they're also maintaining healthy cognition,
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.160]   which is flexible strategy, context-dependent learning,
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.460]   their memory, their working memory.
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:10.840]   They're doing phenomenally well, not just for their age,
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.200]   but even compared to some much younger people.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.980]   So these super-agers are really interesting,
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.720]   both for sake of what they can do into their later years
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.680]   and because their anterior mid-cingulate cortex
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.000]   is holding onto its size
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.180]   and in some cases, increasing its size.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:28.840]   What can allow you to activate and increase the size
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.920]   of your anterior mid-cingulate cortex?
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920]   Well, it's very simple,
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.640]   to do things that you don't want to do.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.480]   I should be very clear,
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.480]   we're talking about things that can be done safely
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.580]   that aren't going to damage you physically
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:43.400]   or psychologically, but we are talking about exercise
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.960]   or in some cases, cognitive exercise,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.520]   but today we're talking about physical exercise
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.040]   that you would much rather not do.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:52.420]   So if you're like me and you love resistance training,
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:53.760]   it can be hard, right?
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.720]   Some days I want to do it more than others
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.400]   and sometimes the workouts are much harder than others,
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.240]   but I love it.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.360]   But if I want to maintain and increase the size
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.900]   of my anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:07.360]   I absolutely have to find some form of physical exercise
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.320]   that I would much rather not do.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.360]   But as I mentioned before, that's also safe physically
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.880]   and it's not going to damage me emotionally.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.200]   I don't know what kind of physical exercise
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.080]   would damage me emotionally, but you get the point.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.620]   This brain area has been explored
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.820]   in a number of different studies.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.160]   So successful dieters increase the size
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.900]   of their anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.760]   People that fail to reach a goal,
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.280]   a diet goal or other goal,
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.560]   experience a shrinking of their anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.720]   There's also examples of physical exercise
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:36.760]   increasing anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.600]   skill challenges and on and on.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.080]   The important point is that the anterior mid-cingulate cortex
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.020]   is agnostic with respect to what you do,
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.120]   except that it has to be something that you don't want to do
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.360]   if you want to build and maintain its size.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.900]   And that building and maintaining
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.200]   of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex size
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.320]   is strongly correlated.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.100]   It's not necessarily causal,
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.560]   but it's strongly correlated with this super aging phenomenon.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.800]   There's a wonderful review
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.240]   about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.320]   that was authored by none other than Lisa Feldman Barrett.
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.640]   She came up earlier in this episode.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.440]   She's a world-class researcher
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.960]   on the topic of emotions and the basis of emotions, et cetera.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.920]   The title of this paper is "The Tenacious Brain,
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.640]   How the Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.680]   Contributes to Achieving Goals."
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.480]   And there's one figure in this paper.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.800]   I just want to summarize a couple of things from,
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:28.340]   because it's just like a wow figure.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:29.560]   There aren't many figures like this.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.720]   I mean, this is a review article.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.440]   So this figure includes panels
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.480]   pooling from a bunch of different studies,
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.560]   but I'm going to just highlight a few of these
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.600]   by paraphrasing what's in the figure legend, okay?
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.480]   So bear with me here.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.640]   I think you'll find this very interesting.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.580]   Okay, so you can't see the pictures
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:48.240]   because many people are listening to this on audio,
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.440]   but you can certainly look up the paper.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.240]   We provide a link to it in the show note captions,
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.280]   but these points are worth paying attention to.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.080]   Spontaneous anterior mid-cingulate cortex activity
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.600]   predicts grit,
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.980]   this psychological phenomenon that we refer to as grit.
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:03.480]   Now this was teased out in a study of grit.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.160]   Grit is this ability to lean into challenge
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.420]   and the mere spontaneous activity, right?
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.480]   Not evoked activity.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.500]   There's spontaneous activity,
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.760]   which is the activity that occurs sort of naturally
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.960]   as a consequence of engaging
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.960]   in a particular thought pattern or behavior.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.400]   And then there's evoked activity
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.640]   when you stimulate a brain area.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.340]   This is spontaneous activity.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:24.320]   Spontaneous anterior mid-cingulate activity
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.680]   is associated with the psychological phenomenon,
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.800]   the verb that we call grit.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:32.400]   And grit can be thought of as an adjective, right?
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.960]   Somebody who's really gritty,
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.320]   but it should best be thought of as a verb.
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.680]   It's the leaning into challenge.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:41.440]   Greater anterior mid-cingulate cortex activity
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.320]   is associated with higher levels of persistence.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.880]   This again was teased out in a study of persistence.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.800]   So these aren't just philosophical statements
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.760]   or theoretical statements.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.580]   These are based on brain imaging studies
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:52.960]   where people are being challenged
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.720]   with a particular set of challenges
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.040]   while they're in a so-called fMRI,
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.320]   functional magnetic resonance imaging machine.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.600]   Activation of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.760]   is associated with grit and with persistence.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   And anterior mid-cingulate signal
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.800]   is associated with willingness to exert more effort.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.000]   If people have to exert more effort
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.880]   and they're willing to do that, boom,
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.240]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex activity goes up.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.280]   Also anterior mid-cingulate activity increases, get this,
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.920]   during effort magnitude estimation.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.640]   Even when people are just trying to gauge
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.600]   how much effort something's going to take,
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.240]   that starts to initiate activity
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.360]   of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.600]   Oh boy, this is going to be a big one.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:34.600]   I got to do this.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.840]   And I'll explain how I engage my anterior mid-cingulate
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.200]   cortex, you'll have to decide
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.240]   if that's something that you hate enough
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.600]   so that you can use it too.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.320]   Almost done here, folks.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.080]   Anterior mid-cingulate signal tracks
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.480]   the subjective value of effort exerted.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:51.160]   As people start to track how much effort they're exerting,
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.840]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex activity goes up.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.080]   And last but not least,
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.320]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex stimulation,
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.960]   so this is no longer spontaneous activity,
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.220]   but stimulation increases the will to persevere.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.320]   Incredible.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.560]   Never before, meaning never before reading this article
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.360]   and learning about anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.240]   which again is largely the consequence of work done
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.740]   somewhere between the years of 2010 and now, 2025,
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:20.560]   did we even understand what the anterior mid-cingulate
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.680]   cortex is there for and is doing.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:23.760]   It could do other things too,
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.880]   but this is an extraordinary set of findings
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.040]   and an extraordinary brain structure
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:29.960]   that everyone should know about.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.560]   And that's why number five on that list,
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.000]   if you want to improve brain function
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.900]   and brain health over time,
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:38.100]   is to do something you really don't want to do,
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:40.060]   something really challenging,
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:43.080]   both psychologically challenging and physically challenging,
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.540]   at least once per week.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:47.540]   Make sure it's safe psychologically and physically,
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.380]   but do that thing.
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:53.040]   For me, I must confess, it's deliberate cold exposure,
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.800]   but it's deliberate cold exposure
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.460]   under particular conditions.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:59.240]   I'll be the first to say that I love getting
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:01.060]   into the ice bath or the cold plunge
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:03.720]   or taking a cold shower after I've been in a hot sauna
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.120]   for 20 or 30 minutes,
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.160]   or after a long run where I'm sweating
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:10.520]   and I want to cool off, or on a hot summer day.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.200]   But most of the time, that's not the case,
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.200]   meaning most of the time when I do deliberate cold exposure,
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.680]   and sometimes I'll do it by cold shower,
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:19.000]   which by the way, is zero cost.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.840]   It'll even save you on your heating bill,
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.200]   so you don't need to buy any equipment,
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.880]   or you could do a cold plunge or an ice bath,
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.780]   but you don't need one.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:27.240]   Most of the time,
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.500]   when I even think about getting into the cold plunge
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.180]   or taking a cold shower,
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:32.700]   that is very likely increasing
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.500]   my anterior mid-cingulate cortex activity,
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.280]   because I love, love, love the heat.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:37.280]   I love sauna.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.260]   I'm very heat adapted.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.960]   I'm comfortable at very high temperatures in the sauna.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.480]   I don't hate the cold, but I close to hate the cold.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.140]   So for me, the first wall to get over,
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.100]   the first bit of resistance that's really hard
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:51.660]   for me to get over is to walk towards the cold plunge.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.180]   Then it's to take the lid off.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:54.660]   Then it's to look at the thing.
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:55.820]   Then it's to get in.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.940]   But I force myself to do it.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.300]   I make sure that I do it safely,
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.300]   and I make sure that I do it
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.800]   for about one to three minutes, sometimes longer.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:05.020]   But I do it because yes,
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.760]   deliberate cold exposure increases release
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.420]   of the so-called catecholamines,
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.100]   dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:12.440]   Also, yes, I know that those catecholamines
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:13.800]   are going to make me feel much better
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.340]   after I get out of the cold plunge for many, many hours.
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:17.540]   That's been established.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:21.420]   But I also do deliberate cold exposure by cold shower
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.940]   or by cold immersion because I hate it.
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.680]   And because I know that by doing it,
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.340]   I'm going to be activating my will to persevere,
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:30.660]   my grit, my willpower.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.140]   Now, today's discussion is not
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.340]   about deliberate cold exposure.
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:35.200]   It's about exercise.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.340]   So what I've started doing in recent months,
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:40.640]   and I'm certainly going to continue into 2025,
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.220]   is to start adding some form of exercise
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:45.540]   that I absolutely don't want to do
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:48.620]   in order to activate my anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.440]   Now, for me, because my schedule is very full,
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.120]   I'm already doing six workouts per week.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.140]   Again, some of them are shorter.
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.260]   Some of them are longer.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.740]   I don't have a lot of extra time to exercise.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.660]   I don't have a lot of time to start rolling jujitsu
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.660]   for a couple hours a week, which I wouldn't loathe,
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:03.840]   but there's a big barrier for me to do that sort of thing.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:06.340]   So maybe it's perfect for activating AMCC,
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:08.300]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:11.460]   Rather, what I've decided to do is to include
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:13.840]   the one thing that I've been putting off for years
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.540]   that frankly, I may enjoy down the line,
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:18.980]   but that I don't enjoy currently.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.380]   And that's to do some sort of really coordinated,
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:26.580]   specific motor activity that has to be done precisely
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.760]   or very precisely before you can say
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.060]   that you've quote unquote, done it right.
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:33.180]   And for me, the thing that I'm selecting,
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.180]   because I already like to jump rope
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.100]   and I can do a few different things with a jump rope.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.520]   I'm not super skilled, but I can already jump rope,
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.980]   is something that my friend, Mark Bell exposed me to,
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:45.900]   which is this rope flow thing.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.100]   Feel free to laugh if you want,
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.180]   but this stuff is hard and it's really, really cool.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:51.780]   The rope flow involves just taking a rope, okay?
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.620]   There may be specific commercial brands of these,
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.900]   but I was told I can just use a kind of thick rope
[01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:56.940]   that you buy at the hardware store
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.740]   or like a dog leash type rope.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:45:59.980]   And you can look this up online.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:00.860]   We'll provide a link to it.
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:03.780]   There's a specific pattern of moving the rope
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.140]   where you're not actually jumping through it.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:06.660]   So it's not jumping rope,
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.760]   but you're actually moving it in front of
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.540]   and behind your body and from side to side
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.340]   and involves a lot of different shifting
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:14.260]   from one limb to the other in very deliberate ways.
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.380]   And as I'm discussing this,
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:17.020]   I realized that I really don't want to do this,
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.940]   but I know it's going to be very useful for me,
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:22.420]   which is exactly why I'm going to use it in 2025
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:25.000]   to enhance my anterior mid cingulate cortex activity.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.260]   The only fear being that I'm going to start to like it,
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.620]   and then I'll have to find something else
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.940]   to engage my anterior mid cingulate cortex.
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:33.420]   And perhaps at that point,
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.100]   I'll look to you guys in the comment sections
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:38.380]   to figure out what sorts of exercise I would hate the most
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.200]   in order to make sure
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.980]   that I'm getting my anterior mid cingulate cortex activation
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:46.420]   because yes, increased coordination is great.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:47.980]   Who wouldn't want that?
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:50.860]   But mainly because I want to improve my brain performance
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:55.120]   and brain function, both in the short term and over time.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.560]   So if you want in the comment section on YouTube,
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:58.960]   because that's where I can see the comments best
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.240]   or perhaps on Spotify as well,
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.720]   where they now have a comment section,
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.640]   I guess Apple has a comment section too.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.660]   YouTube, Apple, or Spotify put in the comment section,
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:09.760]   the form of exercise that's both psychologically
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.520]   and physically safe for you to embrace,
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.360]   but that you would loathe to do
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.000]   and that you're going to perhaps, no, not perhaps,
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.840]   that you're going to commit to doing in 2025.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.540]   And then we can compare and contrast
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:23.860]   and we can all see which ones we hate the most.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.660]   And then we can exchange which exercises we hate the most.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.960]   And everyone can laugh at us
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.200]   for doing these things that we hate.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.620]   And yet we'll be the ones laughing
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:33.380]   because our anterior mid cingulate cortices
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.860]   will be nice and plump well into our old ages.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:37.460]   And everybody else will be wondering
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.860]   where the comment section is.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:41.420]   Thank you everybody for joining me for today's discussion,
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:43.780]   all about how exercise can be leveraged
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:46.900]   to improve brain health and brain performance.

[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.300]   for the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:15.780]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.620]   I do read all the comments.
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:20.060]   And if you're not already following me on social media,
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.900]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.780]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.060]   Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:29.300]   And on all those platforms,
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:31.460]   I discuss science and science related tools,
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:32.940]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:34.380]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.380]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:37.840]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.360]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.820]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:44.620]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:45.860]   the Neural Network newsletter
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.800]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.000]   that includes everything from podcast summaries
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.180]   to what we call protocols
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:53.860]   in the form of brief one to three page PDFs
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.540]   that cover things like how to optimize your sleep,
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:58.220]   how to regulate your dopamine.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:01.340]   We also have protocols related to deliberate cold exposure,
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:03.140]   get a lot of questions about that,
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.140]   deliberate heat exposure, and on and on.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.220]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:09.140]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.240]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.340]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:15.260]   And I should mention that we do not share
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:17.060]   your email with anybody.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.620]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.860]   all about exercise, brain health, and performance.
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:25.060]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:27.240]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.820]   [upbeat music]
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:32.400]   (upbeat music)
