[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - We are blessed to be joined this week
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.160]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast by a guest and our friend,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.280]   Francis Chan, who joins us from San Francisco.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.320]   Francis and his wife Lisa are the authors of the new book,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.920]   You and Me Forever, Marriage in Light of Eternity.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.400]   And we will get to marriage questions soon enough,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.900]   but first I wanna ask you, Francis,
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.960]   about your fight for joy in Christ every day.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.040]   Is this a struggle for you?
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.200]   Does Francis Chan fight for joy in Christ?
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.600]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.580]   I have to fight for joy every day.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.120]   For me, it's a real fight for my mind.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   Lately, the battle has been multitasking, okay?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.880]   Because I love to accomplish.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.760]   I love to get a lot of things done in one day.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.080]   And I'm like, man, why do one thing when you can do three?
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.000]   So you're just going and it's all for the kingdom
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.520]   and everything, but then it comes time to pray.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.640]   And this is where multitasking can kill you,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.160]   is your mind is used to doing several things at once.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.320]   And if you're trying to do three things at once,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   you really can't worship him wholeheartedly.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.640]   First Peter 4, seven talks about being clear minded
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.760]   for the purpose of prayer,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.600]   and to be self-controlled and sober minded, clear minded.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   And my fight is those times where I just wanna get away
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560]   from everything and to rejoice in the Lord.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.840]   I mean, genuinely, just to come into the presence of God
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.440]   and not have my mind wander.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.900]   So sometimes I'm pacing, sometimes I'm praying out loud,
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.920]   sometimes I'm singing out loud,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.600]   sometimes I'm on my knees,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   sometimes doing all three or four of those things
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.280]   just so that my mind doesn't switch to something else.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.160]   I'm just 100% focused on God,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.800]   thanking him for everything I have in Christ.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.760]   I mean, life is good.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.960]   Our existence is good, we're so blessed.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.400]   But to focus on that and to really rejoice in that,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.520]   gosh, it's a real fight.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.200]   To the point where I just, a few weeks ago,
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.840]   because we've got like a dozen people living in our house
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.320]   and it's not a big house, so the noise factor
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.440]   along with technology, everything else,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.800]   I just ended up building a little room in my garage,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.920]   tiny rooms, more like a closet or something,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   just so that I can escape and get alone and worship him
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.600]   and thank him and tell him how great it is to know him
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.560]   and restore that joy in my life.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.280]   I don't know how other people get charged up,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.680]   but for me, it's really coming in the presence of God
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.400]   and enjoying him.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   That's the type of joy that lasts.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   Like if I can get that time
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.400]   and really be focused in the morning,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.600]   it really does just go throughout the whole day.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.720]   - That's very good and comforting for all of us
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.480]   in the battle for joy in God.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.320]   That's Francis Chan, co-author of a new book
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.140]   with his wife Lisa titled You and Me Forever,
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.760]   Marriage in Light of Eternity.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.300]   And tomorrow I wanna ask you about a few lines
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.440]   from your book, especially this one, quote,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.920]   "If you'd rather watch your kids grow up
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.600]   than see the face of your savior today,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.920]   you don't grasp the beauty of God," end quote.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.120]   Wow, that's got some Philippians 1, 21 punch to it.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.480]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll be back tomorrow.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.640]   (upbeat music)
