[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   The following is a conversation with Jo Bowler,
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.840]   a mathematics educator at Stanford
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.080]   and co-founder of ucubed.org
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.080]   that seeks to inspire young minds
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.520]   with the beauty of mathematics.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.040]   To support this podcast,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.120]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.320]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.400]   and here is my conversation with Jo Bowler.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.200]   What to you is beautiful about mathematics?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.400]   - I love a mathematics that some people
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.760]   don't even think of as mathematics,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.640]   which is beautiful, creative mathematics,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.560]   where we look at maths in different ways,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.280]   we visualize it,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.720]   we think about different solutions to problems.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.000]   A lot of people think of maths as
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600]   you have one method and one answer.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.200]   And what I love about maths
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.040]   is the multiple different ways you can see things,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.800]   different methods, different ways of seeing, different...
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200]   In some cases, different solutions.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.160]   So that is what is beautiful to me about mathematics,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   that you can see and solve it in many different ways.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.040]   And also the sad part that many people think
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.880]   that maths is just one answer and one method.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.360]   - So to you, the beauty emerges
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.600]   when you have a problem with a solution
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.120]   and you start adding other solutions,
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.480]   simpler solutions, weirder solutions, more interesting,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.200]   some that are visual, some of their algebraic,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.120]   geometry, all that kind of stuff.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.080]   - Yeah, I mean, I always say that you can take any maths area
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.400]   and make it visual.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   And we say to teachers,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.920]   give us your most dry, boring maths
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.240]   and we'll make it a visual, interesting, creative problem.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.920]   And it turns out you can do that with any area of maths.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.640]   And I think we've given...
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   It's been a great disservice to kids and others
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.440]   that it's always been numbers,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.160]   lots and lots of numbers.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.080]   Numbers can be great,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.040]   but you can think about maths in other ways besides numbers.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.120]   - Do you find that most people are better visual learners
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.560]   or is this just something that's complimentary?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.040]   What's the kind of the full spectrum of students
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.400]   and the way they like to explore math, would you say?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.480]   - There's definitely people who come into the classes I do
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   who are more interested in visual thinking
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.960]   and like visual approaches.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.680]   But it turns out what the neuroscience is telling us
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   is that when we think about maths,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.160]   there are two visual pathways in the brain
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.760]   and we should all be thinking about it visually.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.440]   Some approaches have been to say,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.400]   well, you're a visual learner, so we'll give you visuals
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.640]   and you're not a visual learner.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.120]   But actually, if you think you're not a visual learner,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   it's probably more important that you have a visual approach
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.560]   so you can develop that part of your brain.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.880]   - So you were saying that there's some kind
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520]   of interconnected aspect to it,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.680]   so the visual connects with the non-visual.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.840]   - Yeah, so this is what the neuroscience has shown us,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.160]   that when you work on a maths problem,
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.480]   there are five different brain pathways
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.720]   and that the most high-achieving people in the world
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420]   are people who have more connections
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.440]   between these pathways.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.840]   So if you see a maths problem with numbers,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.880]   but you also see it visually,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.960]   that will cause a connection to happen in your brain
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.840]   between these pathways.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.080]   And if you maybe write about it with words,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.360]   that would cause another connection,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.460]   or maybe you build it with something physical,
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.360]   that would cause a different connection.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   And what we want for kids is,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.640]   we call it a multidimensional experience of maths,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   seeing it in different ways,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.860]   experiencing it in different ways,
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.600]   that will cause that great connected brain.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.000]   - You know, there's these stories
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.280]   of physicists doing the same.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.000]   I find physicists are often better
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.160]   at building that part of their brain
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.620]   of using visualization for intuition building,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.020]   'cause you ultimately want to understand
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.080]   the deepest secret underneath this problem.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.800]   And for that, you have to intuit your way there.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.720]   And you mentioned offline that one of the ways
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.560]   you might approach a problem
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.880]   is to try to tell a story about it.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.800]   And some of it is like legend,
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.520]   but I'm sure it's not always.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.480]   Is you have Einstein thinking about a train
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.680]   and the speed of light,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.000]   and that kind of intuition is useful.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.920]   You start to imagine a physical world,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.480]   like how does this idea manifest itself
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.320]   in the physical world,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.560]   and then start playing in your mind
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.840]   with that physical world,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.200]   and think, is this going to be true?
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.480]   Is this going to be true?
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.320]   - Right, right.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.800]   Einstein is well known for thinking visually.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.080]   And people talk about how he really
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.520]   didn't want to go anywhere with problems
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.240]   without thinking about them visually.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.800]   But the other thing you mentioned
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.400]   that sparked something for me
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.800]   is thinking with intuition,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.440]   like having intuition about math problems.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.120]   That's another thing that's often absent in math class,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.840]   the idea that you might think about a problem
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.020]   and use your intuition,
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.800]   but so important.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.860]   And when mathematicians are interviewed,
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.200]   they will very frequently talk about
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.240]   the role of intuition in solving problems,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.480]   but not commonly acknowledged
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.000]   or brought into education.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.880]   - Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.720]   If you task yourself with building
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.320]   an intuition about a problem,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.720]   that's where you start to pull in,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.200]   like what is the pattern I'm seeing?
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.600]   In order to understand the pattern,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   you might want to then start utilizing visualization.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   But ultimately, that's all in service
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.520]   of like solving the puzzle,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.840]   like cracking it open
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.400]   to get the simple explanation
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.760]   of why things are the way they are,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.160]   as opposed to, like you said,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.640]   having a particular algorithm
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.160]   that you can then execute to solve the problem.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.160]   Yeah, but it's hard.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.000]   It's hard.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.840]   - Yeah. - Like reasoning
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.660]   is really hard.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.160]   - Yeah, it's hard.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.860]   I mean, I love to value what's hard in maths
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.640]   instead of being afraid of it.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.520]   We know that when you struggle,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.560]   that's actually a really good time for your brain.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.160]   You want to be struggling
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.280]   when you're thinking about things.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.120]   So if it's hard to think intuitively about something,
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.640]   that's probably a really good time for your brain.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.760]   I used to work with somebody called Sebastian Thrun,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.600]   who is a great sort of mathematician,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.280]   you might think of him, an AI person.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.780]   And I remember in one interview I did with him,
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.840]   he talked about how they'd built robots,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.640]   I think for the Smithsonian,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.400]   and how they were having this trouble
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.360]   with them picking up white noise.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.600]   And he said they had to solve it.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   They had to work out what was going on,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.360]   and how he intuitively worked out what the problem was.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.640]   But then it took him three weeks to show it mathematically.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.080]   I thought that was really interesting,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.680]   that how you can have this intuition
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.840]   and know something works.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   It's kind of different from going through
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.060]   that long mathematical process of proving it.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.320]   But so important.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.680]   - Yeah, I think probably our brains are evolved
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.000]   as like intuition machines.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.960]   And the math of like showing it like formally
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.160]   is probably an extra thing that we're not designed for.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   You see that with Feynman and his,
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.040]   all of these physicists definitely you see
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.180]   starting with intuition,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.520]   sometimes starting with an experiment,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.960]   and then the experiment inspires intuition.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.360]   But you can think of an experiment
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.120]   as a kind of visualization.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.320]   Just like let's take whatever the heck we're looking at
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.700]   and draw it, and draw like the pattern as it evolves
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.120]   as the thing grows for N equals one,
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.800]   for N equals two, N equals three,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.840]   and you start to play with it.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.720]   And then in the modern day, which I loved doing,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.480]   is you can write a program that then visualizes it for you.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.520]   And then you can start exploring it programmatically.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.160]   And then you can do so interactively too.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.600]   I tend to not like interactive
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.680]   because it takes way too much work.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.160]   'Cause you have to click and move and stuff.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.880]   I love to interact through writing programs.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.480]   But that's my particular brain, software engineer.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.200]   So you can do all these kinds of visualizations.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.080]   And then there's the tools of visualization like color,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.640]   all of those kinds of things.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.240]   That you're absolutely right,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.200]   they're actually not taught very much.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.800]   Like the art of visualization.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.040]   - Not taught.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.720]   And we love as well color coding.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.480]   Like when you represent something mathematically,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   you can show color to show the growth.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.000]   And kind of code that.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.280]   So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.680]   maybe I show the X with a certain color,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.960]   but also write in that color
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.360]   so you can see the relationship.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.280]   Very cool.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.800]   And yeah, particularly in our work with elementary teachers,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.720]   many of them come to our workshops
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   and they're literally in tears
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.840]   when they see things making sense visually.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.320]   Because they've spent their whole lives
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.240]   not realizing you can really understand things
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.920]   with these visuals.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.720]   It's quite powerful.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   - You say that there's something valuable to learning
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.480]   when the thing that you're doing is challenging,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.640]   is difficult.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.000]   So a lot of people say math is hard,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.040]   or math is too hard, or too hard for me.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.380]   Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.940]   - I think it's great when things are challenging,
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.180]   but there's something that's really key
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.900]   to being able to deal with challenging maths,
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.820]   and that is knowing that you can do it.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.700]   And I think the problem in education
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.200]   is a lot of people have got this idea
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.020]   that you're either born with a maths brain or you're not.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.740]   So when they start to struggle,
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.440]   they think, oh, I don't have that maths brain.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.980]   And then they will literally sort of switch off
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.860]   in their brain and things will go downhill
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.060]   from that point.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.240]   So struggle becomes a lot easier,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.940]   and you're able to struggle if you don't have that idea.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.420]   But you know that you can do it.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.000]   You have to go through this struggle to get there,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.720]   but you're able to do that.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.780]   And so we're hampered in being able to struggle
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.260]   with these ideas we've been given about what we can do.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.940]   - Can I ask a difficult question here?
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.780]   - Yeah.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.980]   - So there's kind of, I don't know what the right term is,
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.980]   but some people struggle with learning in different ways.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.420]   Like their brain is constructed in different ways.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.020]   And how much should, as educators,
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.260]   should we make room for that?
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.380]   So how do you know the difference between this is hard,
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.460]   and I don't like doing hard things,
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.060]   versus my brain is wired in a way
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.040]   where I need to learn in very different ways.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.620]   I can't learn it this way.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.340]   How do you find that line?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.020]   How do you operate in that gray area?
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.380]   - So this is why being a teacher is so hard.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.380]   And people really don't appreciate
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.300]   how difficult teaching is when you're faced with,
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.940]   I don't know, 30 students who think in different ways.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.500]   But this is also why I believe it's so important
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.940]   to have this multidimensional approach to maths.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.700]   We've really offered it in one way,
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.380]   which is here's some numbers and a method.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.260]   You follow me, do what I just did, and then reproduce it.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.900]   And so there are some kids who like doing that,
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.900]   and they do well.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.700]   And a lot of kids who don't like doing it,
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.140]   and don't do well.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.820]   But when you open up maths,
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.700]   and you let kids experience it in different ways,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.700]   maybe visually, with numbers, with words,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.500]   what happens is there are many more kids who can access it.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.220]   So those different brain wirings you're talking about,
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.900]   where some people are just more able to do something
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.900]   in a particular way, that's why we want to,
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.740]   that's one of the reasons we want to open it up,
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.580]   so that there are different ways of accessing it.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.180]   And then that's not really a problem.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.460]   - So I grew up in the Soviet Union,
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.420]   and fell in love with math early.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.860]   I was forced into math early,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.380]   and fell in love through force.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.220]   - That's good.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.540]   Well, good that you fell in love.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.380]   (laughing)
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.380]   But something we talked about a little bit,
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.300]   is there's such a value for excellence.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.900]   It's competitive, and it's also everybody kind of looks up,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.900]   the definition of success is being,
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.300]   in a particular class, is being really good at it.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.900]   And it's not improving, it's being really good.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.220]   I mean, we are much more like that with sports,
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.940]   for example, we're not,
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.860]   it's like it's understood,
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.780]   you're going to star on the basketball team,
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.420]   if you're gonna start on the basketball team,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.140]   if you're going to be better than the other guys,
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.540]   the other girls on the team.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:12.220]   So that coupled with the belief,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.700]   this could be partially a communist belief, I don't know,
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.220]   but the belief that everybody is capable of being great.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.220]   But if you're not great, that's your fault,
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.460]   and you need to work harder.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.940]   And I remember I had a sense that, probably delusional,
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.660]   but I could win a Nobel Prize,
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.460]   I don't even know what that entails.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:38.100]   But I thought, like my dad early on told me,
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.540]   just offhand, and it always stuck with me,
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.500]   that if you can figure out how to build a time machine,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.140]   how to travel back in time,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.380]   it will probably give you a Nobel Prize.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.420]   And I remember early in my life thinking,
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.620]   I'm going to invent the time machine.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   And the tools of mathematics were in service of that dream
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.460]   of winning the Nobel Prize.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.300]   And it's silly, I didn't really think
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.500]   in those concrete terms,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.780]   but I just thought I could be great, that feeling.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.660]   And then when you struggle,
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.460]   the belief that you could be great,
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.140]   struggle is good.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.580]   - Right, pushes you on, yeah.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.500]   - And so the other thing about the Soviet system
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.580]   that I'd love to hear your comments about,
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.860]   is just the sheer hours of math.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.660]   Like the number of courses,
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.300]   you're talking about a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.700]   I think in the American system,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.100]   you take maybe one year of geometry.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.020]   - In high school, yeah.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.740]   - In high school, first of all,
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.500]   geometry is beautiful, it's visual.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.140]   And then you get to reason through proofs
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.180]   and stuff like that.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.860]   In Russia, I remember just being nailed over and over,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.620]   it was just nonstop.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.700]   And then of course,
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.020]   there's different perspectives on calculus
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.020]   and just the whole, the sense was that math is like,
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.660]   fundamental to the development of the human mind.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.420]   So math, but also science and literature, by the way,
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.660]   was also hit very hard.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.220]   Like we read a lot of serious adult stuff.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.940]   America does that a little bit too.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.620]   They challenge young adults with good literature,
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.180]   but they don't challenge adults very much with math.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.860]   So those two things, valuing excellence
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.740]   and just a lot of math in the curriculum.
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.900]   Do you think, do you find that interesting?
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.580]   'Cause it seems to have been successful.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.180]   - Yeah, I think that's very interesting.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.740]   And there is a lot of success,
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.140]   people coming through the Soviet system.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.340]   I think something that's very different to the US
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.500]   and other countries in the world
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.940]   is this idea that excellence is important
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.100]   and you can get there if you work hard.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.740]   In the US, there's an idea that excellence is important,
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.180]   but then kids are given the idea in many ways
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.780]   that you can either do it
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.180]   or you're one of the people who can't.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.500]   So many students in the school system
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.740]   think they're one of the kids who can't.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.300]   So there's no point in trying hard
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.740]   because you're never going to get there.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.660]   So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.180]   And it seems from what you've said,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.580]   that in the US, in the Soviet Union,
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.380]   that idea is really different.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.060]   Now, the downside of that idea,
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.740]   that anybody can get there if you work hard,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.100]   is that thought that if you're not getting there,
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.580]   it's your fault.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.740]   And I would add something into that.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.740]   I would say that anybody can get there,
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.180]   but they need to work hard
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.180]   and they also need good teaching
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.020]   because there are some people who really can't get there
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.820]   because they're not given access to that good teaching.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.660]   But that would be huge, that change.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.460]   As to doing lots of maths,
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.020]   if maths was interesting and open and creative
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.820]   and multidimensional, I would be all for it.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.100]   We actually run summer camps at Stanford
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.700]   where we invite kids in
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.740]   and we give them this maths that I love.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.380]   And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.740]   And when we were planning,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.460]   the teachers were like, "Three hours?
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.500]   Are we going to be able to keep the kids excited
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.500]   for three hours?"
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.020]   Turned out, they didn't want to go to break or lunch.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.460]   They'd be so into these mathematical patterns.
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.100]   We couldn't stop them.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.820]   It was amazing.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.220]   So yeah, if maths was more like that,
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.100]   then I think having more of it would be a really good thing.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.180]   - So what age are you talking about?
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:37.100]   Could you comment on what age is the most important
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.020]   when people quit math or give up on themselves
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.780]   or on math in general?
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.540]   And perhaps that age or something earlier
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.620]   is really an important moment for them to discover,
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.460]   to be inspired to discover the magic of math.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.420]   - I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.220]   and maths around, from about fifth grade.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.380]   And then those middle school years are really important.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.540]   And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.940]   just because they're allowed to explore
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.460]   and think in good ways in the early grades
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.300]   of elementary school.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.460]   But fifth grade teachers are often like,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.460]   "Okay, we're going to prepare you now for middle school.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.180]   And we're going to give you grades and lots of tests."
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.740]   And that's when kids start to feel really badly
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.580]   about themselves.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.780]   And so middle school years,
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.020]   our camps are middle school students.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.180]   We think of those years as really pivotal.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.580]   Many kids in those years are deciding,
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.660]   "Yes, I'm going to keep going with STEM subjects."
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.340]   Or, "No, I'm not, this isn't for me."
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.780]   So, I mean, all years are important.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.100]   And in all years, you can kind of switch kids
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.620]   and get them on a different pathway.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.420]   But I think those middle school years are really important.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.820]   - So what's the role of the teacher in this?
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.060]   So one is the explanation of the subject,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.060]   but do you think teachers should almost do like one-on-one,
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.780]   you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.820]   Like that energy of like--
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.340]   - Turns out it's really important.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.460]   There's a study that was done,
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.380]   it was actually done in high school English classrooms,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.060]   where all kids wrote an essay for their teacher.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.060]   And this was done as an experiment.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.860]   Half of the kids got feedback from their teacher,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.060]   diagnostic feedback, which is great.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.020]   But for half of the kids,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.940]   it said an extra sentence at the bottom
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.260]   that the researchers had put on.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.020]   And the kids who read that extra sentence
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.500]   did significantly better in English a whole year later.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.740]   The only change was this one sentence.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.660]   - What did the sentence say?
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.740]   - So what did the sentence say?
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.900]   The sentence said, I'm giving you this feedback
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.140]   because I believe in you.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.660]   And the kids who read that did better a year later.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.500]   - Yeah.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.940]   - So when I share this with teachers, I say, you know,
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.020]   I'm not suggesting you put on the bottom of all kids' work,
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.420]   I'm giving this feedback because I believe in you.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.740]   One of the teachers said to me, we don't put it on a stamp?
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.380]   I said, no, don't put it on a stamp.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.020]   But your words are really important.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.540]   And kids are sitting in classrooms all the time thinking,
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.900]   what does my teacher think of me?
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.700]   Does my teacher think I can do this?
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.500]   So it turns out it is really important to be saying to kids,
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.620]   I know you can do this.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.620]   And those messages are not given enough by teachers.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.020]   - And really believe it.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   - And believe it, yeah.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.860]   - It's like--
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.500]   - You can't just say it, you have to believe it.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.380]   - I sometimes, 'cause it's like,
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.060]   it's such a funny dance,
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.580]   'cause I'm such a perfectionist,
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.340]   I'm extremely self-critical,
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.660]   and I have, when I have students come up to me,
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.660]   and it's clear to me that they're not even close to good.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.340]   And it's tempting for me to be like,
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.340]   to sort of give up on them mentally.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.860]   But the reality is, like,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.980]   if you look at many great people throughout history,
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.380]   they sucked at some point.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.220]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.220]   - And some of the greatest took non-linear paths
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.780]   to where they sucked for long into later life.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.420]   And so always kind of believing
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.300]   that this person can be great.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.500]   - Exactly.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.860]   - You have to communicate that,
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.620]   plus the fact that they have to work hard.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.060]   - That's it, yeah.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.940]   Yeah, and you're right.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.500]   Silicon Valley, where I live,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.580]   is filled with people who were dropouts at school,
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.020]   or who had special needs, who didn't succeed.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.740]   It's very interesting that have gone on
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.260]   to do amazing work in creative ways.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.660]   I mean, I do think our school system is set up
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.460]   to value good memorizers,
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.740]   who can reproduce what a teacher is showing them,
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.220]   and push away those creative, deep thinkers,
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.620]   often slower thinkers, they think slowly and deeply.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.380]   And they often get the idea early on
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.060]   that they can't be good at maths or other subjects.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.340]   So yeah, I think many of those people
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.180]   are the ones who go on and do amazing things.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.300]   - So there's a guy named Eric Weinstein.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.820]   I know many mathematicians like this,
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.740]   but he talks a lot about having
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.860]   a non-standard way of learning.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.700]   I mean, a lot of great mathematicians,
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.100]   a lot of great physicists are like that.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.660]   And he felt like he became quickly,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.420]   he got his PhD at Harvard,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.580]   became quickly an outcast of the system.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.260]   Like the education, especially early education system
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.180]   didn't help him.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.900]   Is there ways for an education system
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.340]   to support people like that?
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.420]   Is it this kind of multi-dimensional learning
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.300]   that you're mentioning? - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.620]   I mean, I think our education system
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.860]   still uses an approach that was in classrooms
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.340]   hundreds of years ago.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.740]   The textbooks have a lot to answer for,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.460]   and producing is very uninspiring mathematics.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.700]   But yeah, if you open up the subject
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.940]   and have people see and solve it in different ways
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.300]   and value those different ways.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.260]   Somebody I appreciated a lot
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.660]   is a mathematician called Mary Mizzikani.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.540]   I don't know if you've heard of her.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.460]   She won the Fields Medal.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.460]   She was from Iran.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.580]   First woman in the world
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.780]   to win the Fields Medal in mathematics.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.460]   She died when she was 40.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.220]   She was at Stanford.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.820]   But her work was entirely visual.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.580]   And she talked about how her daughter
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.740]   thought she was an artist
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.660]   because she was always visualizing.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   And I attended, she asked me to chair the PhD defense
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.420]   for one of her students.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.260]   And I went to the defense in the math department.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.420]   And it was so interesting
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.260]   because this young woman spent like two hours
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.780]   sharing her work.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.780]   All of it was visual.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.460]   In fact, I don't think I saw any numbers at all.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.300]   - That's awesome.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.460]   - And I remember that day thinking,
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.940]   wow, I could have brought her like 13 year old
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.980]   into this PhD defense.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.300]   They would not recognize this as maths.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.740]   But when Mary Mizzikani won the Fields Medal,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.660]   all these other mathematicians were saying
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.940]   that her work had connected
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.220]   all these previously unconnected areas of maths.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.260]   And so, but when she was,
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.140]   she also shared that when she was in school,
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.660]   when she was about 13,
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.100]   she was told that she couldn't do maths.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.740]   She was told that by her teacher.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.020]   - This is Iran?
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.260]   - Mm-hmm, in Iran.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.380]   So I love that, you know,
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.380]   to be told you can't be good at maths
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.900]   and then go on and win the Fields Medal is cool.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.180]   - I've been told by a lot of people in my life
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.220]   that I can't do something.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.860]   I'm very definitely non-standard.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.420]   But all it takes, that's why people talk about
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.700]   like the one teacher that changed everything.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.060]   All it takes is one teacher.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.900]   - That's right.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.420]   - That's the power of that.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.860]   So that should be inspiring to teachers.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.580]   - I think it is.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.820]   - You as a single person,
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.020]   given the education system, given the incentives,
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.300]   you have the power to truly change lives.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.060]   And like 20 years from now,
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.020]   a Fields Medalist will walk up to you and say thank you.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.380]   - You did that for me.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.380]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.180]   And I share that with teachers
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.580]   that even in this broken system
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.820]   of what they have to do for districts and textbooks,
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.940]   a single teacher can change kids' maths relationship
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.500]   or other subjects and forever.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.620]   - What's the role of the parents in this picture?
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.660]   Let's go to another difficult subject.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.140]   - Yeah, that is a difficult subject.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.140]   One study found that
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:42.780]   the amount of maths anxiety parents had
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.420]   predicted their child's achievement in school,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   but only if they helped with homework.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.140]   (both laughing)
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:55.980]   - That's so funny.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.820]   - Yeah, there are some interesting implications for this.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.300]   I mean, you can see how it works.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.540]   If you have maths anxiety
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.900]   and you're helping your kids with homework,
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.300]   you're probably communicating things like,
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.180]   oh, I was terrible at this at school,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.440]   and that's how it gets passed on to kids.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.620]   So one implication is
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.980]   if you have a really bad relationship with maths,
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.100]   you hate maths, you have maths anxiety,
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.400]   just don't do maths homework with your kids.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:28.540]   But on our website, we have a little sheet for parents
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.240]   of ways to interact around maths with your kids.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.620]   - That's ucubed.org?
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.360]   - That's ucubed.org, yes.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.020]   So one of the things I say to parents
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.000]   when I give parent presentations is,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.700]   even if you hate maths,
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.780]   you need to just fake it with your kids.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.000]   You should be always endlessly optimistic
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.740]   and happy about doing maths.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.460]   - I'm always curious about this.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.900]   So I hope to have kids one day,
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.300]   I don't have kids currently.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.120]   Are parents okay with sucking at math
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.460]   and then trying to get their kid
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.180]   to be better than them, essentially?
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.020]   Is that a difficult thing for a lot of parents?
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.940]   - It is difficult.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.860]   To have like, it's almost like an ego thing.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.140]   Like I never got good at this
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.540]   and I probably should have.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.860]   Yeah, I mean, to me, you wanna celebrate that,
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.860]   but I know a lot of people struggle with that.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.220]   Like coaches in sports,
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.700]   to make an athlete become better than them,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.780]   it can be hard on the ego.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.620]   - Yeah.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.660]   - Do you experience the same with parents?
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.500]   - Parents too.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.540]   I haven't experienced parents worrying
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.820]   that their kids will be better than them.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.740]   I have experienced parents
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.980]   just having a really bad relationship with maths
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.300]   and not wanting to help,
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.020]   not knowing how to help, saying things.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.660]   Like another study showed
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.100]   that when mothers say to their daughters,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.100]   "I was bad at maths in school,"
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.460]   their daughter's achievement goes down.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.020]   So we know that kids pick up on these messages,
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.420]   which is why I say you should fake it.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.180]   But also I know that lots of people
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.340]   have just had a really bad relationship with maths,
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.140]   even successful people.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.540]   The undergrads I teach at Stanford
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.100]   have pretty much always done well in maths,
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.060]   but they come to Stanford thinking maths
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.020]   is a set of methods to memorize.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.460]   And so do many parents believe that.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.340]   There's one method that you memorize
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.900]   and then you reproduce it.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.100]   So until people have really had an experience
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.300]   of what I think of as the other maths,
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.740]   where until they've really seen
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.580]   that it's a really different subject,
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:51.300]   it's hard for them to be able to shift their kids
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.620]   to see it differently.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.060]   - Is there for a teacher,
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.100]   if we're to like systematize it,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.820]   is there something teachers can do
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.420]   to do this more effectively?
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.060]   So you mentioned the textbook.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:04.900]   - Yeah.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.220]   - So what are the additional things
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.980]   you can add on top of this whole old school,
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.700]   traditional way of teaching that can improve the process?
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.540]   - So I do think there's a way of teaching maths
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.660]   that changes everything for kids and teachers.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.460]   So I'm one of five writers of a new framework
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.580]   for the state of California, a new maths framework.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.220]   It's coming out next year.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.220]   And we are recommending through this maths framework
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.860]   that people teach in this way.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.540]   It's called teaching to big ideas.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.540]   So at the moment, people have standards
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.500]   that have been written,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.820]   and then textbooks have taken these standards
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.900]   and made not very good questions.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.500]   And if you look at the standards,
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.060]   like I have some written down here,
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.580]   just reading the standards,
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.780]   it makes maths seem really boring and uninspiring.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.980]   - What are the kind of, can you give a few examples?
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.220]   - So this is an interesting example.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.180]   In third grade, there are three different standards
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.680]   about unit squares.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.660]   - Okay.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.660]   - So this is one of them.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.180]   A square with side length one unit, called a unit square,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.820]   is said to have one square unit of area
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.580]   and can be used to measure area.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.420]   - And that's something you're expected to learn.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.620]   - That is something, so that's a standard.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.940]   The textbook authors say,
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.460]   oh, I'm gonna make a question about that.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.180]   And they translate the standards into narrow questions.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.340]   - And then you measure success
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.940]   by your ability to deliver on these standards.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.100]   - So the standards themselves,
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.820]   I think of maths, and many people think of maths in this way,
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.780]   as a subject of a few big ideas
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.140]   and really important connections between them.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.420]   So you could think of it as a network map
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.660]   of ideas and connections.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.820]   And what standards do is they take that beautiful map
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.780]   and they chop it up like this into lots of little pieces,
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.060]   and they deliver the pieces to schools.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.300]   And so teachers don't see the connections between ideas,
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.500]   nor do the kids.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.460]   So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.900]   that what we've done in this new initiative
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.140]   is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.580]   and connections between them.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.900]   So this is grade three.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.180]   So instead of there being 60 standards,
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.700]   we've said, well, you can pull these different standards
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.220]   to get in with each other,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:37.220]   and also value the ways these are connected.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.860]   - And by the way, for people who are just listening,
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:44.020]   we're looking at a small number of big concepts
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.420]   within mathematics, square tiles,
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.060]   measuring fraction, shape, and time,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.900]   and then how they're interconnected.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.940]   And so the goal is for,
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.060]   this is for grade three, for example.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.900]   - Yeah.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.980]   And so we've set out for the state of California,
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.500]   the whole of mathematics K10
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.100]   as a set of big ideas and connections.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.460]   So we know that teachers, it works really well
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.460]   if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:19.140]   And instead of reading five procedural statements
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.460]   that involve measuring, they think,
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.540]   okay, measuring is a big idea.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.340]   What rich, deep activity can I use
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.860]   that teaches measuring to kids?
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.420]   And as kids work on these deep, rich activities,
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.580]   maybe over a few days,
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.940]   turns out a lot of maths comes into it.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.100]   So we're recommending that let's not teach maths
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.380]   according to all these multiple, multiple statements
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.580]   and lots and lots of short questions.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.060]   Instead, let's teach maths by thinking about
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.020]   what are the big ideas and what are really rich,
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.700]   deep activities that teach those big ideas.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.900]   - So that's the, like how you teach it
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.580]   and maximize learning.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.420]   What about like from a school district perspective,
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.620]   like measuring how well you're doing,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.980]   grades and tests and stuff like that?
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.900]   Do you throw those out or is it possible?
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.460]   - I'm not a fan of grades and tests myself.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.940]   I think grades are fine
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.980]   if they're used at the end of a course.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.020]   So at the end of my maths course,
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.820]   I might get a grade because a grade
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.340]   is meant to be a summative measure.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.660]   It kind of describes your summative achievement.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.260]   But the problem we have in maths classrooms across the US
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.420]   is people use grades all the time,
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.340]   every week or every day even.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.540]   My own kids, when they went through high school,
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.540]   technology has not helped with this.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.780]   When they went through high school,
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.820]   they knew they were being graded
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.860]   for everything they did, everything.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.100]   And not only were they being graded for everything,
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.380]   but they could see it in the grade book online
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.860]   and it would alter every class they went into.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.900]   So this is the ultimate,
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.460]   what I think of as a performance culture.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.060]   You're there to perform, somebody's measuring you,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.820]   you see your score.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:08.580]   So I think that's not conducive for deep learning.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.940]   And yes, have a grade at the end of the year,
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.380]   but during the year,
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.580]   you can assess kids in much better ways.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.700]   Like teachers can, a great way of assessing kids
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.060]   is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.980]   what they're learning over the course of a unit
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.740]   or a few weeks.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.740]   So kids can actually see the journey they're on,
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.100]   like this is what we're doing mathematically.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.340]   Sometimes they self-assess on those units.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:39.340]   And then teachers will show what the kids can do
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.140]   with a rubric and also write notes.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.540]   Like, in the next few weeks,
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.980]   you might like to learn to do this.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.820]   So instead of kids just thinking about,
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.140]   I'm an A kid or a B kid,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.220]   or I have this letter attached to me,
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.940]   they're actually seeing mathematically what's important.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.620]   And they're involved in the process
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.340]   of knowing where they are mathematically.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.820]   At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.260]   but during the year,
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.220]   they get these much more informative measures.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.780]   - I do think this might be more for college,
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.340]   but maybe not.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.660]   Some of the best classes I've had
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.100]   is when I got a special set aside.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.900]   The professor clearly saw that I was interested
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900]   in some aspect of a thing.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.260]   And then I have a few in mind,
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.900]   and one in particular,
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.140]   he said that he challenged me.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.380]   So this is outside of grades and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.940]   That basically it's like reverse psychology.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.260]   I don't think this can be done.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.980]   And so I gave everything to do that particular thing.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.380]   So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.380]   But I think that special treatment of taking students
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.540]   who are especially excellent at a particular little aspect,
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.180]   that you see their eyes light up.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.500]   I often think maybe it's tempting for a teacher
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.740]   to think you've already succeeded there,
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.460]   but they're actually signaling to you
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.300]   that you could really launch them on their way.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.660]   And I don't know, that's too much to expect from teachers,
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.940]   I think, to pay attention to all of that,
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.980]   'cause it's really difficult.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.040]   But I just kind of remember who are the biggest,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.380]   the most important people in the history
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.860]   of my life of education.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.900]   And it's those people who really didn't just inspire me
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.420]   with their awesomeness, which they did,
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.180]   but also just, they pushed me a little.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.220]   They gave me a little push.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.420]   And that requires focusing on the quote unquote excellent
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.060]   students in the class.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.540]   - I think what's important though,
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.060]   is teachers to have the perspective that they don't know
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.460]   who's gonna be excellent at something
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.340]   before they give out the activity.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.180]   - Exactly.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.740]   - And in our camp classes that we ran,
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:10.420]   sometimes students would finish ahead of other students.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.500]   And we would say to them,
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.940]   "Can you write a question that's like this, but different?"
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.460]   Oh, and over time, we encouraged them
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.780]   to like extend things further.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.820]   I remember we were doing one activity
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.180]   where kids were working out the borders of a square
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.540]   and how big this border would be in different case sizes.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.300]   And one of the boys came up at the end of the class
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.860]   and said, "I've been thinking about how you do this
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.460]   "with the Pentagon."
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.140]   And I said, "That's fantastic.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.380]   "How do you, what does it look like with Pentagon?
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.220]   "Go find out, see if you can discover."
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.740]   So I didn't know he was gonna come up and say that.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.740]   And I didn't have in my head,
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.620]   like this is the kid who could have this extension task.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.820]   But you can still do that as a teacher.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.380]   When kids get excited about something
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.220]   or they're doing well in something,
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.420]   have them extend it, go further.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.100]   It's great.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.500]   - And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach,
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.940]   you could say it in different ways to different students.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.940]   Like for me, the right thing to say is almost to say,
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.340]   I don't think you could do this, this is too hard.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.020]   Like that's what I need to hear.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.340]   'Cause it's like, no, there's an immediate push.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.220]   But with some people, if they're a little bit more,
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.940]   I mean, it all has to do with upbringing,
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.220]   just how your genetics is.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.380]   They might be much more, that might break them.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.220]   - Yeah, that might break them.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.380]   - And so you have to be also sensitive to that.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.700]   I mean, teaching is really difficult.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.180]   - It is really difficult.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.220]   - For this very reason.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.260]   - It is.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.780]   - So what is the best way to teach math,
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.780]   to learn math at those early few days
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.420]   when you just wanna capture them?
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.340]   - I do something, actually there's a video of me
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.860]   doing this on our website that I love
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.180]   when I first meet students.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.300]   And this is what I do.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.260]   I show them a picture, this is the picture I show them.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.980]   And it's a picture of seven dots like this.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.100]   And I show it for just a few seconds.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.740]   And I say to them, I'd like you to tell me
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.140]   how many dots there are, but I don't need to count them.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.820]   I want you to group the dots.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.140]   And I show it them and then I take it away
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.060]   before they've even had enough time to count them.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.740]   And then I ask them, so how did you see it?
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   And I go around the room and amazingly enough,
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.980]   there's probably 18 different ways
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.340]   of seeing these seven dots.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:42.260]   And so I ask people, tell me how you grouped it.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.340]   And some people see it as like an outside hole
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.700]   with a center dot.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.260]   Some people see like stripes of lines.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.780]   Some people see segments.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.780]   And I collect them all and I put them on the board.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.460]   And at the end I say, look at this,
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.460]   we are a class of 30 kids and we saw these seven dots
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.300]   in 18 different ways.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.940]   There's actually a mathematical term for this.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.780]   It's called groupitizing.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   - Groupitizing?
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.620]   - Yeah.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.440]   (laughing)
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.280]   - I like it.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.100]   - It's kind of cool.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.900]   So turns out though that how well you groupitize
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.660]   predicts how well you do in math.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.980]   - Is it a raw talent or is it just something
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.820]   that you can develop?
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.660]   - I don't think you're born groupitizing, I think.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.340]   But some kids have developed that ability if you like.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.260]   And you can learn it.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.260]   You can, so this to me is part of how wrong we have math.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.660]   That we think to tell whether a kid's good at math,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.660]   we're gonna give them a speed test on multiples.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.920]   But actually, seeing how kids group dots
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.180]   could be a more important assessment
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.260]   of how well they're gonna do in math.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.620]   Anyway, I diverge.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.300]   What I like to do when I start off with kids is show them,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.580]   I'm gonna give you math problems.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.100]   I'm gonna value the different ways you see them.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.900]   And turns out you can do this kind of problem
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.100]   asking people how they group dots with young children
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.500]   or with graduate students.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.220]   And it's engaging for all of them.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.180]   - You talk about creativity a little bit
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.180]   and flexibility in your book "Limitless".
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.780]   What's the role of that?
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.780]   So it sounds like there's a bit of that kind of thing
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.700]   involved in groupitizing.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.700]   - I love this term.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.580]   So what would you say is the role of creativity
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.340]   and flexibility in the learning of math?
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.820]   - I think what we know now is that what we need
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.820]   for this 21st century world we live in is a flexible mind.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.420]   School should not really be about teaching kids
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.980]   particular methods, but teaching them to approach problems
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.500]   with flexibility.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.900]   Being creative, thinking creatively is really important.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.980]   So people don't think the words math and creativity
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.260]   come together, but that's what I love about math
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.900]   is the creative different ways you can see it.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.900]   And so helping our kids, there's a book I like a lot
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.980]   by, I think by physicists.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.940]   You probably know this book called "Elastic".
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.860]   You might know it.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.460]   And it's about how we want elastic minds.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.500]   Same kind of thing, flexible, creative minds.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:26.500]   And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:31.780]   They do a lot of developing the kind of mind
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.300]   that a computer now does for us.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.580]   - Memorization.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.580]   - Memorization, doing procedures, a lot of things
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.380]   that we spend a lot of time in school on.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.540]   In the world, when kids leave school,
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.580]   a computer will do that.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.540]   And better than they will.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.860]   But that creative, flexible thinking,
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.140]   we're kind of at ground zero at computers
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.500]   being able to engage in that thinking.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.900]   Maybe we're a little above ground zero,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.780]   but the human brain is perfectly suited
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.540]   for that creative, flexible thinking.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.860]   That's what humans are so great at.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.060]   So I would like the balance to shift in schools.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.140]   Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking,
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.700]   but there should be a lot more
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.900]   of that creative, flexible thinking.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.940]   - And what's the role of other humans in this picture?
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.940]   So collaborative learning, so brainstorming together.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.620]   So creativity as it emerges
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.500]   from the collective intelligence of multiple humans.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.500]   - Yeah, super important.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.580]   And we know that also helps develop your brain,
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.300]   that social side of thinking.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.900]   And I love mathematics collaboration
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.540]   where people build on each other's ideas
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.780]   and they come up with amazing things.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:54.100]   I actually taught 100 students calculus
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.900]   at Stanford recently, undergrads.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.460]   And we taught them to collaborate.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.300]   So these students came in Stanford
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.660]   and most of them were against collaboration in math.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.260]   - This is before COVID in person?
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.380]   - Yeah, it was just before COVID hit.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.260]   It was 2019.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.100]   And this summer--
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.780]   - Sorry, you said they're against?
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   - Yeah, so it's really interesting.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.220]   So they'd only experienced maths individually
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.140]   in a kind of competitive individual way.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.700]   And if they had experienced it as group work,
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.620]   it had been a bad experience.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.860]   Like maybe they were the one who did it all
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.540]   and the others didn't do much.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.180]   So they were kind of against collaboration.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.140]   They didn't see any role for it in maths.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.540]   And we taught them to collaborate.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:42.180]   And it was hard work because as well as the fact
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.580]   that they were kind of against collaboration,
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.540]   they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.500]   So I'm in this room with other Stanford undergrads
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.540]   and they're better than me.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.820]   So when we set them to work on a maths problem together,
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.260]   the first one was kind of a disaster
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.300]   because they were all like, they're better than me,
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.540]   they're faster than me.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.660]   They came up with something I didn't come up with.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.980]   So we taught them to let go of that thinking
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.620]   and to work well together.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.020]   And one of the things we did,
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.580]   we decided we wanted to do a pre and post test
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.540]   at the end of this teaching.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.780]   It was only four weeks long,
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.220]   but we knew we didn't want to give them
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.340]   like a time test of individual work.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.740]   So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.220]   and we gave them to do in pairs together.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.620]   And we gave each of them a different colored pen
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.060]   and said, work on this activity together
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.060]   and keep using that pen.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.180]   So then we had all these pieces of student work.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.580]   And what we saw was they just worked
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.220]   on separate parts of the paper.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.060]   So there's a little like red pen section
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.740]   and a green pen section.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.940]   And they didn't do that well on it,
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.100]   even though it was a problem
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.820]   that middle or high school kids could do,
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.740]   but it was like a problem solving kind of problem.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.060]   And then we gave them the same one to do at the end,
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.220]   gave them the same colors
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   and actually they had learned to collaborate.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.140]   And not only were they collaborating the second time around,
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.060]   but that boosted their achievement.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.900]   And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.260]   Collaboration is important, having people,
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.540]   and what was so eye opening for these undergrads
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.380]   and they talked about it in lovely ways
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:19.980]   was I learned to value other people's thinking on a problem.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.540]   And I learned to value
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.340]   that other people saw it in different ways.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.340]   And it was quite a big experience for them
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.700]   that they came out thinking,
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.660]   I can do maths with other people,
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.860]   people can see it differently,
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.340]   we can build on each other's ways of thinking.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.540]   - I got a chance to,
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.020]   I don't know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is,
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.100]   got a chance to interact with him.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.900]   And like the first, 'cause he had a few,
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.500]   but one famous collaboration throughout his life
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.940]   with Tversky and just like,
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.540]   he hasn't met me before in person,
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.300]   but just the number of questions he was asking,
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.140]   just the curiosity.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.420]   So I think one of the skills,
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.980]   the collaboration itself is a skill.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.780]   And I remember my experience with him was like,
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.020]   okay, I get why you're so good at collaboration
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.460]   because he was just extremely good at listening
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.420]   and genuine curiosity about how the other person
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.380]   thinks about the world, sees the world.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.940]   And then together, he pulled me in,
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.460]   in that particular case,
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.340]   he doesn't know in particular
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.180]   like that much about autonomous vehicles,
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.540]   but he kept like asking all of these questions.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.380]   And then like 10 minutes in,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.100]   we're together trying to solve the problem
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:39.900]   of autonomous driving.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.100]   And like, and that, I mean, that's really fulfilling,
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:43.940]   that's really enriching,
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.700]   but it also in that moment made me realize
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.180]   it's kind of a skill
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.740]   is you have to kind of put your ego aside,
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.500]   put your view of the world aside
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.780]   and try to learn how the other person sees it.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.580]   - And the other thing you have to put aside
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.660]   is this social comparison thinking.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.300]   Like if you are sitting there thinking,
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.860]   wow, that was an amazing idea,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.660]   he's so much better than I am,
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.180]   that's really gonna stop you
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.500]   taking on the value of that idea.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.300]   So there's a lot of that going on
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.660]   between these Stanford students when they came.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.980]   And trying to help them let go of that.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.300]   - One of the things I've discovered
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.380]   just because being a little bit more in the public eye,
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.420]   how rewarding it is to celebrate others.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.820]   And how much is going to actually pay off in the long term.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.220]   So this kind of silo thinking of like,
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.260]   I want to prove to a small set of people around me
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.220]   that I'm really smart
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.500]   and do so by basically not celebrating
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.820]   how smart the other people are,
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.580]   that's actually maybe short term,
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.580]   it seems like a good strategy, but longterm it's not.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.500]   And I think if you practice at the student level
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.900]   and then at the career level, at every single stage,
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.540]   I think that's ultimately--
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.380]   - I agree with you,
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.460]   I think that's a really good way of thinking about it.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.020]   - You mentioned textbooks.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.300]   And you didn't say it,
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:15.460]   maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to teach mathematics.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.340]   But I love textbooks.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.940]   They're like pretty pictures and they smell nice.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.700]   I mean, I talk about like physical,
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.340]   some of my greatest experiences have been just like,
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.340]   'cause they're really well done.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.580]   When we're talking about basic,
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   like high school, calculus, biology, chemistry,
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.900]   those are incredible.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.340]   It's like Wikipedia, but with color and nice little--
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.020]   - You must have seen some good textbooks
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.580]   if they had pretty pictures and color.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I remember,
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.260]   I guess it was very, very standard,
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.540]   like AP calculus, AP biology, AP chemistry.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.140]   I felt those are like some of the happiest days of my life
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.100]   in terms of learning was high school.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.780]   'Cause it was very easy, honestly.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.300]   It felt hard at the time,
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.140]   but you're basically doing a whirlwind tour
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.540]   of all the science.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.220]   Without having to pick, you do literature,
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.740]   you do like Shakespeare, calculus, biology, physics,
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.100]   chemistry, what else?
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:23.580]   Anatomy, physiology, computer science,
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.780]   without like nobody's telling you what to do with your life.
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.060]   You're just doing all of those things.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.700]   - That's a good thing, you're right.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.460]   - But I remember the textbooks weren't,
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.420]   I mean, maybe I'm romanticizing the past,
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.660]   but I remember they weren't, they're pretty good.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.020]   But so you think, what role do you think they play still?
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.500]   And like in this more modern digital age,
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.740]   what's the best materials
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.100]   with which to do these kinds of educations?
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.860]   - Well, I'm intrigued that you had such a good experience
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:53.700]   with textbooks.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.820]   I mean, I can remember loving some textbooks
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.540]   I had when I was learning and I love books.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.140]   I love to pick up books and look through them.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.580]   But a lot of math textbooks
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.940]   are not good experiences for kids.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.940]   We have a video on our website
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.140]   of the kids who came to our camp
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.660]   and one of the students says,
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.780]   "In maths, you have to follow the textbook.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.500]   "The textbook's kind of like the Bible.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.460]   "You have to follow it."
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.940]   And every day, it's slightly different.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.820]   Like on Monday, you do 2.3.2
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:32.500]   and on Tuesday, you do 2.3.3 and on Wednesday.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.100]   And you never go off that.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.860]   That's like every single day.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:42.540]   And that's not inspiring for a lot of the kids.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.420]   So one of the things they loved about our camp
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.860]   was just that there were no books.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.700]   Even though we gave them sheets of paper instead,
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.020]   they still felt more free
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.580]   because they weren't just like trotting through exercises.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:02.060]   - Like what a textbook allows you is like,
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:06.660]   the very thing you said they might not like,
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:11.100]   the 2.3, 2.3, it feels like you're making progress
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.740]   and like it's a little celebration
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.180]   'cause you do the problem and it seems really hard
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.300]   and you don't know how to do it.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.940]   And then you try and try and then eventually succeed.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.620]   And then you make that little step and further progress.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.180]   And then you get to the end of a chapter
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.020]   and you get to like, it's closure.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.860]   You're like, "All right, I got that figured out."
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.340]   And then you go on to the next chapter.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.260]   - I can see that.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.900]   I mean, I think it could be in a textbook.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.980]   You can have a good experience with a textbook,
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:43.180]   but what's really important is what is in that textbook?
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.300]   What are you doing inside it?
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.300]   And I mean, I grew up in England and in England,
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.460]   we learn maths.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.380]   We don't have this separation of algebra and geometry.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.140]   And I don't think any other country
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.220]   apart from the US has that.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.220]   But I look at kids in algebra classes
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.740]   where they're doing algebra for a year.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.860]   And I think I would have been pretty bored doing that.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.420]   (laughing)
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:13.060]   - By the way, can we analyze your upbringing real quick?
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:18.060]   Why do British folks call mathematics maths?
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.580]   Why is it the plural?
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.100]   Is it because of everything you're saying
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.180]   or is it a bunch of sub-disciplines?
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:29.820]   - Yeah, I mean, mathematics is supposed to be
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   the different maths that you look at,
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.020]   whether you think of that as topics
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.780]   like geometry and probability,
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.940]   or I think of it as maths is just multi-dimensional,
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.700]   lots of ways, but that's why it was called mathematics.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.500]   And then it was shortened to maths.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.340]   And then for some reason, it was just math in the US,
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:58.340]   but to me, math has that more singular feel to it.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.860]   And there's an expression here, which is do the math,
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.220]   which basically means do a calculation.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.500]   That's what people mean by do the math.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.380]   So I don't like that expression
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.260]   'cause math could be anything.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.540]   It doesn't have to be calculation.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.620]   So yeah, I like maths
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.340]   'cause it has more of that broad feel to it.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.180]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.020]   Maths kind of emphasizes the multi-dimensional,
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.900]   like a variety of different sub-disciplines,
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.340]   different approaches, yeah.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.700]   Okay, but outside of the textbook,
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   what do you see broadly being used?
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.940]   You mentioned Sebastian Thrun and MOOCs, online education.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.460]   Do you think that's an effective set of-
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.980]   - Can be.
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.100]   I mean, online, having great teachers online
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.140]   obviously extends those teachers to many more people,
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.820]   and that's a wonderful thing.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.300]   I have quite a few online courses myself.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   I got the bug working with Sebastian
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.820]   when he had released his first MOOC.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.500]   And I thought, hmm, maybe I could do one in maths education.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.460]   And I didn't know if anybody would take it.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.460]   And I remember releasing it that first summer,
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.940]   and it was a free online class,
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.820]   and 30,000 maths teachers took it that first summer.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.060]   And they were all talking about it with each other
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.060]   and sharing it, and it was like, took off.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:23.060]   In fact, it was that MOOC that got me to create Ucubed
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:27.060]   with Kathy Williams, who's the co-founder,
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.580]   because people took the MOOC,
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.500]   and then they said, "Okay, what now?
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.380]   "I finished, what can I have next?"
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.860]   So that was where we made our website.
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.620]   But so yeah, I think online education can be great.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:45.460]   I do think a lot of the MOOCs don't have great pedagogy.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.540]   They're just a talking head.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:52.540]   And you can actually engage people in more active ways,
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.860]   even in online learning.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.740]   So I learned from the Udacity principle
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.140]   when I was working at Udacity
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.580]   never to talk more than like five minutes,
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.980]   and then to ask people to do something.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.740]   So that's the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have,
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.420]   is a little bit of presenting something,
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.540]   and then people do something,
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.100]   and then there's a little bit more.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.180]   Because I think if you have a half hour video,
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:20.940]   you just switch off and start doing other things.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:24.740]   - So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute,
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:29.700]   like bit of teaching with some visual stuff, perhaps,
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.100]   and then there's like a quiz almost.
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.380]   - Then you answer a question, yeah.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.980]   - Yeah, that's really effective.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.060]   You mentioned Ucubed.
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.780]   So what's the mission, what's the goal?
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.980]   You mentioned how it started, but what's,
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:46.580]   yeah, where are you at now, and what's your dream with it?
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.260]   Or what are the kind of things
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.460]   that people should go and check out on there?
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.420]   - Yeah, we started Ucubed,
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.140]   I guess it was about five years ago now,
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:57.340]   and we've had over 52 million visitors to the site,
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.420]   so I'm very happy about that.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:03.860]   And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:08.020]   with teachers, students, parents in maths,
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.660]   and to help, we have a sort of sub-goal
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.260]   of a raising maths anxiety, that's important to us,
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:17.900]   but also to share maths as this beautiful creative subject.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.420]   And it's been really great.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.860]   We have lessons on the site,
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.980]   but one of the reasons I thought this was needed
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.620]   is there's a lot of knowledge in the academy
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.180]   about how to teach maths well.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.460]   Loads and loads of research and journals
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:38.380]   and lots of things written up, but teachers don't read it.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.140]   They don't have access to it.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.260]   They're often behind pay walls.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.500]   They're written in really inaccessible ways,
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.300]   so people wouldn't want to read them or understand them.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.180]   So this I see as a big problem.
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.780]   You have this whole industry of people
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.740]   finding out how to teach well,
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.780]   not sharing it with the people who are teaching.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.420]   So that's why we made U-Cubed.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.660]   And instead of just putting articles up saying,
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.780]   here's some things to read about how to teach well,
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.220]   we translated what was coming from research
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.500]   into things that teacher could use.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.580]   So lessons, there were videos to show kids,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.420]   and there were tips for parents.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.980]   There were all sorts of things on the site.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.260]   And it's been amazing.
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.860]   We took inspiration from the Week of Code,
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:29.540]   which got teachers to focus on coding for a week.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.380]   And we have this thing called
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.900]   the Week of Inspirational Maths.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.820]   And we say, just try it for a week.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.380]   Just give us one week and try it and see what happens.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.660]   And so it's been downloaded millions of times.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.580]   Teachers use it every year.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.540]   They start the school year with it.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.660]   And what they tell us is, it was amazing.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.740]   The kids' lights were on.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.780]   They were excited.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.980]   They loved it.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:56.020]   And then the week finished, and I opened my textbooks,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:00.020]   and the lights went out, and they were not interested.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.780]   - Yeah, but getting that first inspiration
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.140]   is still powerful.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:04.980]   - It is.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.700]   I wish, I mean, what I would love
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.620]   is if we could actually extend that for the whole year.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.980]   We're a small team at Stanford,
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:17.020]   and we're trying to keep up with great things
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.260]   to put on the site.
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.500]   We haven't the capacity to produce
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.180]   these creative visual math tasks
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.820]   for every year group for every day,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.140]   but I would love to do that.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.580]   - How difficult is it to do?
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.420]   I mean, to come up
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:37.420]   with visual formulations of these big, important topics
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:42.420]   you need to think about in a way that you could teach.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.780]   - I mean, we can do it.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.420]   We actually, we went from the Week of Inspirational Maths,
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:51.980]   and we made K-8 maths books with exactly that.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.940]   Big ideas, rich activities, visuals.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.580]   We just finished the last one.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.980]   We've been doing it for five years,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.660]   and it's been exhausting, and we just finished.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.580]   So now there's a whole K-8 set of books,
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.140]   and they're organized in that way.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.280]   These are the big ideas, here are rich, deep activities.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.060]   They're not, though, what you can do every day for a year.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.060]   So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.940]   to their boring textbook, and some people have said,
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.340]   "Okay, this is the year.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.420]   "This book tells us what the year is,
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.260]   "and then we'll supplement these big activities with."
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:34.440]   So they're being used, and teachers really like them
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.240]   and are really happy about them.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.500]   I just always want more.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.280]   And I guess one of the things I would like for U-Cubed,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.660]   one of my personal goals, is that every teacher of maths
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.500]   knows about U-Cubed.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   At the moment, lots of teachers who come to us
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.800]   are really happy they found it,
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.220]   but there's a lot of other teachers
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.700]   who don't know that it exists.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.940]   - I hope this helps.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.980]   - Yeah.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.460]   - From a student perspective, and not in the classroom,
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.560]   but at home, studying,
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.380]   is there some advice you can give
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.820]   on how to best study mathematics?
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.620]   So what's the role of the student outside the classroom?
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.560]   - Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people,
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.700]   when they review material,
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.340]   whether it's maths or anything else,
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.680]   don't do it in the best way.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.840]   I think a problem a lot of people have
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.000]   is they read through maybe a teacher's explanation
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.840]   or a way of doing maths, and it makes sense.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.360]   And they think, "Oh yeah, I've got that," and they move on.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.880]   But then it's not until you come to try and work on something
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.320]   and do a problem that you actually realize
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.600]   you didn't really understand it,
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.840]   it just seemed to make sense.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.520]   So I would say this is also something
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.680]   that neuroscientists talk about,
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.500]   to keep giving yourself questions
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.640]   is a really good way to study,
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.440]   rather than looking through lots of material.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.560]   It's almost like giving yourself lots of tests
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.480]   is a good way to actually deeply understand things
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.680]   and know what you do when you don't understand.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.240]   - So would the questions be in the form of the material
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.520]   you're reviewing is the answer to that question,
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.080]   or is it almost like beyond,
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.160]   it's the polygon thing that you mentioned,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.960]   or square, is it almost like,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.800]   "I wonder what is the bigger picture?"
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.760]   Always kind of asking, "How is this extended?"
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.600]   And so on.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.720]   - Yeah, that would be great.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.480]   And it's a similar, I mean,
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.520]   a question I get asked a lot is about homework,
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.000]   what is a good thing for kids to do for homework.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   And one of the recommendations I give
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework,
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.080]   but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned,
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.720]   like, "What was the big idea you learned today?"
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.880]   Or, "What did you find difficult?
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.420]   "What did you struggle with?
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.580]   "What was something that was exciting?"
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:01.120]   Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.440]   in a deeper way.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.520]   A lot of times, I don't know if you have this experience
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.640]   as a math student, lots of people do,
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.800]   kids are going through math questions,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.920]   they're successful, they get them right,
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.960]   but they don't even really know what they're about.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.160]   And a lot of kids go through many years of math like that,
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.200]   doing lots of questions,
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.940]   but not really knowing what even the topic is
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.400]   or what it's about, what it's important for.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.680]   So having students go back and think at the end of the day,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.560]   "What was the big idea from this math lesson?
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.260]   "Why is it important?
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.040]   "Where would I find that in real life?"
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.920]   Those are really good questions
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   for kids to be thinking about.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.400]   - It's probably for everybody to be thinking about.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.320]   I think most of us go through life
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.160]   never asking the bigger question.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.600]   Almost like those layers of why questions
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.920]   that kids ask when they're very young.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.960]   We need to keep doing that.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.800]   - We do.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.680]   - Like what, that's the, whatever the term is,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.400]   you call first principles thinking,
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.320]   some people call it that,
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.320]   which is like, why are we doing it this way?
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.760]   - But one nice thing is to do that
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.080]   'cause there's usually a good answer.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.360]   Like the reason we did it this way
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.760]   is because it works for this reason.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.640]   But then if you want to do something totally novel,
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.160]   is you'll say, "Well, we've been doing it this way
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.520]   "because of historical reasons,
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.440]   "but really this is not the best way to do it.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.240]   "There might be other ways."
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.440]   And that's how invention happens.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.480]   And then you get, that's really useful
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.320]   in every aspect of life.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.400]   Like choosing your career, choosing your,
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.840]   I don't know, where you live,
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.920]   who your romantic partner is,
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.960]   like everything. - Everything, yeah.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.200]   - And I think it probably starts doing that in math class.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.840]   - That would be good if we started doing that.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.440]   - I mean, I wonder,
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.000]   I probably didn't do very much of that
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.760]   for most of my education, asking why,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.280]   except for later, much later,
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.600]   in the subjects on like grad school
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.280]   when you're doing research on them.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.680]   When your first task of doing something novel using this
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.000]   or solving a problem really outside the classroom,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.840]   they have to publish on it.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.520]   It's the first time you think,
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:27.000]   "Wait, why are these things interesting, useful?
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.480]   "Which are the things that are useful?"
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.680]   And yeah, I guess that would be nice
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.880]   if we did that much earlier,
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.280]   that the quest of invention.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.280]   I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data I think about
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.280]   is the questions kids ask in school goes down
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.840]   like in a linear progression from in the early years,
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.840]   you can't stop kids asking those questions,
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.760]   but they learn not to ask the questions.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.520]   - I think you told somewhere about an early memory you had
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.720]   in your own education where you asked the question,
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.320]   or maybe that was an example you gave,
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.480]   but it was shut down.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.920]   - Oh yeah.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.080]   You've listened to something I said, yeah.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.160]   (laughing)
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.240]   - I don't remember where it was, but it caught me.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.720]   - Yeah, I remember it really vividly.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.880]   - Well, can you tell the memory?
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.840]   - Yeah, it's funny, I can remember.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.000]   It must have really impacted me in that moment
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.360]   because you know how there's lots of hours of school
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.280]   you don't remember at all.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   But anyway, I can remember where I was sitting
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.120]   and everything.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.400]   I was in a high school maths class,
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.320]   although they don't call it that in England,
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   and the teacher said, and it was like the first class
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.440]   of this teacher's class, and he said,
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.440]   "Ask if you have any questions."
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.800]   So at one point I put my hand up and I said,
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.260]   "I have a question."
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.760]   And he said something like, "That's your question?"
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.880]   (laughing)
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.840]   And I was like, "Okay, I'm not asking any more questions
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.680]   "in this class."
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.000]   - And that hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.120]   the lesson you learned from that is I'm not gonna ask
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.360]   that question. - Yeah, that was absolutely
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.360]   that's the last question I'm asking.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:11.360]   And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.760]   and I remember that really well.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.120]   So maybe because of that experience,
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.440]   one of the things we encourage when we teach kids
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.040]   is asking questions and we value it when they ask questions
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.720]   and we put them up on walls and celebrate.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.400]   - It's funny 'cause I wish there was a feedback signal
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.080]   because he probably, to put a positive spin on it,
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.480]   he probably didn't realize the negative impact
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.760]   he's had in that moment, right?
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.280]   If he only knew.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.160]   See, this is probably when you're more mature in grad school.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.000]   Had an amazing professor named Alicia Kafande
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   in computer science and he would get,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.480]   he encouraged questions, but then he would tell everybody
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.320]   how dumb their questions are.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.400]   But it was, I guess if you show,
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.800]   if you say it with love and respect behind it,
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.720]   then it's more like a friendly, humorous encouragement
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.120]   for more questions.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.360]   It's an art, right?
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.080]   - Yeah, teaching is very hard.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.360]   - You have to time it right because that kind of humor
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.480]   is probably better for when you're in grad school
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.040]   versus when you're in early education.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.880]   - Right, well, and I guess kids or young people
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   get whether somebody's doing it to be funny or has it.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.200]   I mean, this is why teaching is so hard.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.160]   Even your tone can be impactful.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.720]   - It's so sad because like for that particular human,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.840]   the teacher, you could have just had a bad day
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.960]   and one statement can have a profound negative impact.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.160]   - I know, sadly, that maths, there's a lot of maths teachers
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.880]   who have that kind of approach and they,
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.040]   I think they're suffering from the fact
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.240]   that they think people are math people, not math people.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.080]   And that comes across in their teaching.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.800]   - But on the flip side, one positive statement
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.760]   to keep them going.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.280]   - That's right, that is the flip side of that.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.960]   And I myself had like one teacher
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.640]   who was really amazing for me in maths
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.320]   and she kept me in the subject.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.200]   - Who was she?
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.900]   - She was, her name was Mrs. Marshall.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:27.680]   She was my A-level maths teacher.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.120]   So I was in England. - What's that mean?
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.080]   - You do lots of subjects until you're 16
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.360]   and then you choose like three or four subjects.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.680]   So I had chosen maths and you go to--
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.480]   - Higher levels.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.680]   - Probably equivalent more to a master's degree in the US
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.200]   'cause you're more specialized.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.760]   But anyways, she was my teacher.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.720]   And for the first time in my whole career in maths,
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.360]   she would give us problems
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.040]   and then tell us to talk about them with each other.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.040]   And so here I was sitting there at like 17
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.040]   talking with friends about how to solve a math problem.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.840]   And that was it, that was the change that she made.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.040]   But it was profound for me
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.400]   because like those calculus students,
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.220]   I started to hear other people's ways of thinking
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.960]   and seeing it and we would talk together
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.920]   and come up with solutions.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.560]   And I was like, that was it, that changed maths for me.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.080]   - And so it wasn't some kind of personal interaction
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.240]   with her, it was more like she was the catalyst
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.040]   for that collaborative experience.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.960]   - I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.920]   I mean, sometimes it's a personal message
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.840]   but it can be your teaching approach
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.440]   that changes maths for kids.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.440]   - You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called "Deep Work"
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.000]   and he's a mathematician,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.480]   theoretical computer scientist.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.720]   And he talks about the kind of the focus required
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.140]   to do that kind of work.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:01.760]   Is there something you can comment on?
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.960]   You know, we live in a world full of distractions.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.400]   That seems like one of the elements that makes studying
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.280]   and especially the studying of subjects
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.500]   that require thinking like math does difficult.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.440]   Is there something from a student perspective,
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.640]   from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.480]   that you can comment on?
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   - Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:31.440]   and we have some on our website,
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.920]   is a really important experience for them.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.180]   Even if they only do it occasionally,
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.080]   but it's really important.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:44.320]   They actually realize, I give a problem out often
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:47.040]   when I'm working with teachers and I say to them,
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.760]   all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.480]   And they're like, an hour?
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.520]   They think it's shocking.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.160]   And then they work on this problem and after an hour,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.880]   I say, okay, how are we doing?
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.560]   They're like, an hour has gone by?
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.000]   How is this possible?
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   And so everybody needs those like rich, deep problems.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.960]   Most kids go through their whole maths experience
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.080]   of however many years never once working on a problem
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.000]   in that kind of deep way.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.720]   So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.320]   We work on these deep problems every session
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.040]   and the students come away going,
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.040]   okay, I never wanna go back to that maths relationship
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.920]   I had where it was just all about quick answers.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.640]   I just don't wanna go back to that.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.320]   those problems in their classrooms.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.600]   Maybe they don't do them every day,
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.240]   but they at least give kids some experience
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.840]   of being able to work slowly and deeply
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:55.840]   and to go to deeper places and not be told
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.680]   they've got five minutes to finish 20 questions.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.800]   - But part of it is also just the exercise
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.320]   of sitting there and maintaining focus
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.040]   for prolonged periods of time.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.960]   That's not often, I mean, that's a skill.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.000]   It's a skill that also could be discouraging.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.120]   Like if you don't practice it,
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.520]   just sitting down for 10 minutes straight
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.480]   and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.600]   like if you're really thinking about a problem.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.240]   And I think it's really important to realize
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.920]   that that's a skill that you can just like a muscle,
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.560]   you can build, you can start with five minutes
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.760]   and it goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   And to be successful, I think in certain subjects
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.560]   like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.680]   Otherwise, you're not going to get
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.720]   to the really rewarding experience
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.360]   of solving these problems.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.600]   - Definitely.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.960]   There was a survey done of kids in school
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:56.800]   where they were asked,
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.360]   how long will you work on a math problem
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.520]   before you give up and decide it's not possible to solve it?
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.800]   And the result on average across the kids was two minutes.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.440]   - Yeah, that's a bad sign,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.520]   but that was a powerful sign that they need to learn
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.040]   to not give up so quickly.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.360]   We mentioned offline because we've been talking so much
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:29.240]   about visualization, Grant Sanderson, 3Luwan Brown.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.080]   So he's inspired millions of people
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.520]   with exactly the kind of way of thinking
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.680]   that you've been talking about.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.000]   - Yeah, I love his work.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   - Converting sort of mathematical concepts into visual,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.520]   like visually representing them, exploring them in ways
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.160]   that help you illuminate like the concepts.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.040]   What do you think is the role of that?
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.000]   So he uses mostly programmatic visualization.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.280]   So it's the thing I mentioned where there's like animations
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.500]   created by writing computer programs.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.400]   Like, what do you think, how scalable is that approach?
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.440]   But in general, what do you think about his approach?
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.880]   - I think it's amazing.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.180]   I should work with him.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:17.000]   I can share some of our visuals
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.580]   and he can make them in that amazing way.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:23.040]   - So part of his storytelling,
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.360]   part of it is like, it's creating the visuals
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.400]   and then weaving a story with those visuals
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.080]   that kind of builds, like there's also,
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.960]   I mean, there's also drama in it.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.640]   You start with a small example and then you kind of,
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.640]   all of a sudden there's a surprise.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.480]   - And it really, I mean, it makes you fall in love
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.600]   with the concept.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.060]   He does talk about that.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:50.920]   His sense is like some of the stuff,
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.000]   he doesn't feel like he's teaching,
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.460]   like the core curriculum, which is something,
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:03.640]   he sees himself as an inspirational figure,
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.800]   but because I think it's too difficult
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.120]   to kind of convert all of the curriculum
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.640]   into those elements.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.040]   - And probably you don't need to.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.960]   I mean, if people get to experience mathematical ideas
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.840]   in the way that he shares them,
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.640]   that will change them and it will change the way they think
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.880]   and maybe they could go on to take
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.360]   some other mathematical idea and make it that beautiful.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.400]   - Well, he does that.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:33.000]   He created a library called Manum and he open sourced it.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.440]   And that library is the, people should check it out.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   It's written in Python and uses some of those same elements.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.080]   Like it allows you to animate equations
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.680]   and animate little shapes, like people that,
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.400]   he has a very distinct style in his videos
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.720]   and what that resulted in,
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.220]   even though from a software engineer perspective,
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.840]   the code you release is not like super well-documented
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.540]   or perfect, but him releasing that,
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:05.260]   now there's all of these people educating it.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.860]   And the cool, to me personally,
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:10.280]   the coolest thing is to see like people,
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.820]   they're not, don't have like a million subscribers
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.500]   or something, they have just a few views in the video,
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:22.500]   but it just seems like the process of them creating a video
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.220]   where they teach is like transformative to them
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.220]   from a student perspective.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.380]   It's the old Feynman thing,
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.300]   the best way to learn is to teach.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.660]   And then him releasing that into the wild is,
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.820]   it shows that impact.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.500]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.860]   I think just giving people that idea
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.940]   that you can do that with maths and other subjects,
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.700]   there's bound to be people all around
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.780]   who can create more, which is cool.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.180]   - Yeah, I definitely, so I recommend people do
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:52.620]   like JavaScript or Python.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:56.460]   You can build like visualizations of most concepts
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.060]   in high school math,
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.060]   you can do a lot of kinds of visualizations
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.540]   and doing that yourself.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:04.420]   Plus if you do that yourself, people will really love it.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:09.020]   People actually, people love visualizations of math.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:09.860]   - Yeah.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.180]   - 'Cause they, I mean, it's something in us
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.340]   that loves patterns, loves figuring out difficult things
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.820]   and the patterns in there
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:19.060]   then are unexpected in some way.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.060]   - Yeah, have you ever noticed that hotels
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.260]   are always filled with patterns?
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.500]   I was just noticing it at the hotel.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.740]   I mean, now all of their carpets are pattern carpets
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.940]   and then they have patterns on the walls.
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.100]   - Yeah. - So, yeah.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.460]   - We humans love the symmetry in patterns,
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.900]   the breaking of symmetry in patterns.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.980]   - Yeah.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.900]   - And it's funny that we don't see mathematics
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.980]   as somehow intricately connected to that, but it is, right?
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.380]   - I mean, that's one of the perspectives
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.820]   I love students to take is to be a pattern seeker.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.260]   - In everything.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.860]   - Yeah, certainly in all of maths.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.340]   I mean, you can think of all of maths
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.180]   as a kind of subject of patterns
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.100]   and not just visual patterns,
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:05.100]   but when you think about multiplying by five
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:10.740]   and the fact you can, if you're multiplying 18 times five,
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.820]   you can instead think of nine times 10.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:17.260]   That's a pattern that always works in mathematics.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.100]   You can have a number and double the number.
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.340]   And so, yeah, I just think there are patterns everywhere.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.820]   And if kids are thinking their role is to see patterns
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:28.460]   and find patterns, it's really exciting.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.980]   - What do you think about like MIT OpenCourseWare
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:36.300]   and the release of lectures by universities?
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.900]   - I think it's good.
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:38.740]   I think it's good.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.740]   I think that is what started the MOOC I did
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.100]   was using that platform.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.780]   - So you ultimately think like the Udacity models
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.500]   is a little bit more effective
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   than just a plain two-hour lecture?
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.660]   - I think there's definitely,
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.060]   you can bring in good pedagogy into online learning.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.620]   And I think the idea of putting things online
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:02.780]   so that people all over the world can access them is great.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:06.060]   I don't think the initial excitement around MOOCs
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:09.620]   sort of democratizing education and making it more equal
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:14.140]   came about because they found that the people taking MOOCs
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.100]   tended to be the more privileged people.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.220]   So that was, I think there's still something
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.500]   to be found in that.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.660]   There's still more to be done to help
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.740]   that online learning reach those principles.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.900]   But definitely I think it's a good invention.
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:35.180]   And I have an online class that's for kids
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.100]   that's a little free class that gives them--
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.060]   - What's the topic?
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.620]   - It's called How to Learn Maths.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.620]   - How to Learn Maths.
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.500]   - It shows maths as this visual creative subject
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.220]   and it shares mindset and some brain science.
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:51.340]   And kids who take it do better in maths class.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.300]   We've studied it with like randomized controlled trials
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.340]   and given it to middle school kids
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.100]   and other middle school kids who don't take it
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.420]   but are taught by the same teachers.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:03.060]   So their teachers are the same.
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.980]   And the kids who take the online class
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:08.820]   end up 68% more engaged in their maths class
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.620]   and do better at the end of the year.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:15.220]   So that's a little six session, 15 minute class
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.060]   and it changes kids' maths relationships.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:24.060]   So it is true that we can do that with some words
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:29.580]   that aren't, it's not a huge change to the education system.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:33.260]   - Do you have advice for young people?
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.060]   We've been talking about mathematics quite a bit
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.340]   but in terms of their journey through education,
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.940]   through their career choices, through life,
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:46.220]   maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.860]   of how to live a life they can be proud of.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:54.300]   - I think if I were to give advice to people,
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:59.300]   especially young people, my advice would be to always,
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:03.540]   it sounds really corny, but always believe in yourself
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.420]   and know that you can achieve
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.020]   because although that sounds like obvious,
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.460]   of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.900]   I know that millions of kids who are in the school system
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:17.300]   have been given the message they cannot do things.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.660]   And adults too, they have the idea,
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.340]   oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.980]   because those other things I could never have done okay in.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.620]   So actually when they hear,
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:31.580]   hey, maybe you could do those other things,
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:35.060]   even adults think, you know, maybe I can.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.140]   And they go back and they encounter this knowledge
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:40.820]   and they relearn things and they change careers
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.660]   and amazing things happen.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.980]   So for me, I think that message is really important.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.820]   You can learn anything.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.180]   Scientists try and find a limit.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.260]   They're always trying to find a limit.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.540]   Like how much can you really learn?
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.300]   What's the limit to how much you can learn?
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.540]   And they always come away not being able to find it.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.540]   People can just go further and further and further.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:03.140]   And that is true of people born with brain,
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:06.420]   you know, areas of their brain that aren't functioning well
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.780]   that have what we call special needs.
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.980]   Some of those people also go on to develop
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.780]   and do amazing things.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:17.380]   So I think that really experiencing that,
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:22.380]   knowing that, not just saying it, but knowing it deeply,
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.200]   you can learn anything,
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.740]   is something I wish all people would have.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.700]   - Actually also applies when you've achieved
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.500]   some level of success too.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.380]   What I find, like in my life with people that love me,
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:37.980]   when you achieve success,
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.420]   they keep celebrating your success
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.780]   and they want you to keep doing the thing
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.100]   that you were successful at,
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:49.220]   as opposed to believing in that you can do something else,
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:51.700]   something big, whatever your heart says to do.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.020]   And one of the things that I realized the value of this,
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:24:00.540]   you know, quite recently, which is sad to say,
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.300]   is how important it is to seek out,
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.060]   when you're younger, to seek out mentors,
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.460]   to seek out the people,
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:10.340]   like surround yourself with people that will believe in you.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.180]   - Yeah.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.300]   - It's like a little bit is on you.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.940]   It's like, you don't get that,
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:20.260]   sometimes if you go to like grad school,
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.420]   you think you kind of land on a mentor,
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.580]   maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:25.820]   they're interested in.
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.100]   But the reality is the people you surround yourself with,
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.540]   they're going to define your life trajectory.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.740]   So select people that--
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:35.620]   - That's really true.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.780]   And get away from people who don't believe in you.
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:40.220]   - Sometimes parents can be that.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.060]   - Yeah.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.660]   - They can love you deeply, but they set,
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.420]   it's the math thing we mentioned,
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.980]   they might set certain constraints
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.060]   on the beliefs that you have.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:55.180]   And so in that, if you're interested in mathematics
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.900]   and your parents are not that interested in it,
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.460]   don't listen to your parents on that one dimension.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:24:59.700]   - Right.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.900]   Exactly.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.980]   Yeah, and if people tell you you can't do things,
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.740]   you have to hear from other people who believe in you.
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.340]   I think you're absolutely right about that.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.900]   It's so sad the number of people
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.140]   who've had those negative messages from parents.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.620]   In my Limitless Mind book,
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.940]   I interviewed quite a few people
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.620]   who'd been told they couldn't do math,
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:21.820]   sometimes by parents, sometimes by teachers.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.980]   And fortunately, they had got other ideas
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.140]   at some point in their life
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.620]   and realized there was this whole world
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.340]   of mathematical thinking that was open to them.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:35.820]   So it's really important that people
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:39.220]   do connect with people who believe in them.
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:42.020]   However hard that might be to find those people.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.940]   - What do you hope the education system,
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:48.100]   education in general, looks like 10, 20, 50,
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.700]   100 years from now?
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.780]   Are you optimistic about this future?
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.140]   - Yeah, I definitely have hope.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.660]   There is, change can happen in the education system.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.660]   In recent years, it's been microscopically slow.
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:06.940]   But I do actually see change happening.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:10.260]   Like we were talking earlier that data science
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.460]   is now a course you can take in high school
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.380]   instead of algebra two.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.620]   And that's pretty amazing
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:19.980]   because that content was set out in 1892
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.180]   and hasn't changed since then.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.220]   And so now we're actually seeing a change
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.980]   in the content of high school.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.580]   So I'm amazed that that's happening
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.380]   and very happy it's happening.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.060]   So change is very slow in education usually,
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:39.060]   but when you look ahead and think about all that we know
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:43.980]   and all that we can offer kids in terms of technology,
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:48.660]   you've got to think that 100 years from now,
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.620]   education will be totally different to the way it is now.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.100]   Maybe we won't have subject boundaries anymore
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:59.060]   because those don't really make much sense.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:02.500]   - And it's interesting to think how certain tools
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.700]   like programming, maybe they'll be deeply integrated
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:06.540]   in everything we do.
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.380]   - You would think, yeah.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.980]   You would think that all kids are growing up
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:12.780]   learning to program and create.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.020]   So I just think, I mean, the system of schooling
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:18.940]   we have now, people call it a factory model.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.740]   It's not designed to inspire creativity.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:27.340]   And I feel like that will also change.
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.060]   People might look back on these days
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.620]   and think they were hilarious,
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.980]   but maybe in the future,
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.300]   kids will be doing their own programming
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.740]   and they'll be able to learn things
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.580]   and find out things and create things
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.580]   even as they're learning.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:44.580]   And maybe the individual subject boundaries will go.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:48.940]   Data science itself coming into the education system
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.940]   kind of illustrates that because people realize
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.540]   it doesn't really fit inside any of the subjects.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:57.860]   So what do we do with it?
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:58.860]   Where does it go?
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.420]   And who teaches it?
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:04.700]   So it's already raising those kind of questions
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.660]   and questioning how we have
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:09.020]   these different subject boundaries.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.780]   - So you've seen data science be integrated
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.220]   into the curriculum?
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.620]   - Yes, it's happening across the United States as we speak.
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:16.940]   - I wonder how they got initiated.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.820]   Like how does change happen in the education system?
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:22.860]   Is it just a few revolutionary leaders?
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.380]   - I think so, I think so.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:25.980]   It's been an interesting journey
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.020]   seeing data science take off, actually.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:33.980]   There was a course that was developed in 2014
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.100]   by some people who thought data science
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.460]   was a good idea for high schoolers.
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.300]   And then after some kids took the course
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.380]   and nothing bad happened to them,
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:49.300]   they went to college and people started to accept it more.
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:52.300]   And then this was a big piece of the change in California.
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.900]   The UC system communicated.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.380]   They sent out an email last year
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.100]   to 50,000 high schools saying,
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.820]   "We now accept data science.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.900]   Kids can take it instead of Algebra II.
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:04.740]   That's a perfectly legitimate college pathway."
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.340]   So that was like a big green light for a lot of schools
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.220]   who were like wondering about whether they could teach it.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.740]   So I think it happens in small spaces and expands.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.220]   So now-- - It goes viral.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:17.780]   - Yeah. - In this modern age.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:18.660]   - Then it goes viral.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:23.660]   California's ahead, I think, in creating courses
[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:25.460]   and having kids go through it.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.940]   But it's, certainly when I last looked,
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.700]   there were 12 states that were allowing data science
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.540]   as a high school course.
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:37.540]   And I think by next year, that will have doubled or more.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:41.100]   So change is happening.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:44.860]   - Joe, as I said, I think mathematics
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:47.940]   is truly a beautiful subject.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:52.220]   And you having an impact on millions of people's lives
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.980]   by educating them, by inspiring teachers
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.980]   to educate in the ways that you've talked about
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:01.460]   in multi-dimensional ways, in visual ways,
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:02.460]   I think is incredible.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.260]   So you're spreading beauty-- - Thank you, I really
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.060]   appreciate that. - Into the world.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.060]   So I really, really appreciate that you spent
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.260]   your valuable time with me today.
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.100]   Thank you for talking. - Thank you.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:12.580]   It was really good to talk to you.
[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:15.300]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Bowler.

[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.660]   from Albert Einstein.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:27.980]   Pure mathematics is the poetry of logical ideas.
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:31.540]   Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
