[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.940]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.420]   For episode 6, I wanted to take a detour of sorts from some of the topics I've addressed
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800]   because well, frankly, I think it's important to do so.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.080]   The term I want to spend some time talking about in this episode is the term "contributory
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.500]   negligence."
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.660]   The term itself is solely a legal term that I'm borrowing to illustrate a concept.
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.280]   So before we get to the borrowing, let's define the legal term first so we know exactly
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.100]   what we are borrowing.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.880]   Britannica defines contributory negligence as follows, and I quote, "Contributory negligence
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.220]   in law is behavior that contributes to one's own injury or loss and fails to meet the standard
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.520]   of prudence that one should observe for one's own good.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.240]   Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is frequently pleaded in defense to a charge
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   of negligence.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.360]   Historically, the doctrine grew out of distrust of juries, which have usually been more sympathetic
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.640]   to plaintiffs in personal injury lawsuits.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.300]   The policy of not apportioning liability between parties to lawsuits, that is, charging each
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.000]   with some fraction of the blame, also encouraged the doctrine.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.320]   Contributory negligence usually arises in a lawsuit in which a plaintiff has accused
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.160]   a defendant of negligence.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.360]   The defendant may then charge the plaintiff with contributory negligence.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.080]   At common law, if the defendant proves this charge by a preponderance of evidence, the
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.200]   plaintiff cannot recover any damages, even if the defendant was negligent because the
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.240]   contributory negligence breaks the causal connection between the defendant's negligence
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.000]   and plaintiff's injury or loss.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.300]   In English law since the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence Act of 1945) and in many states
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.020]   in the United States, if the plaintiff is shown to have contributed to the injury, recovery
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:54.420]   may still be allowed, but provision is made for an equitable reduction of damages."
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:03.340]   I know that definition might be a little hard to receive just right away, so I want to illustrate
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.040]   this definition by giving you an example.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.540]   Suppose you live in an apartment with a leaky roof.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.940]   It begins to rain heavily and the leaky roof begins to allow water to drip into the bathroom.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:29.840]   You walk into the bathroom, you slip and you land straight on your back and cranium, rendering
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.980]   you unconscious.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.060]   Indignant at the leaky roof, you sue the apartment for allowing the leaky roof in the first place.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.860]   When you hear these set of facts in a closed box, this might seem like an open and shut
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.580]   case, until perhaps I add some more facts.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.060]   Suppose you've known about this leaky roof for over a year now.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.220]   Suppose in the past year you had every opportunity to tell your landlord about the leaky roof
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.240]   that allows the water to drip into your bathroom, but you were just too lazy to contact him.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.860]   This changes things significantly, doesn't it?
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.060]   Remember, the leaky roof still isn't your fault.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.420]   It was not of your doing in any way.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.860]   You live in an apartment, not a home, so you're renting, you're not the owner.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.800]   And what that means is that the responsibility of the upkeep of the apartment, especially
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.460]   outside the apartment on the roof, doesn't fall on you.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:54.900]   However, doesn't common sense dictate that having known about the leaky roof for quite
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.060]   some time, there should be some responsibility on your own part for not reporting the leak
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.560]   earlier?
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.100]   Should you receive a windfall despite the fact that you easily could have had the leaky
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.260]   roof fixed had you reported it?
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.060]   Maybe some of you listening would say that you should still receive some compensation,
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.140]   but perhaps that compensation should be mitigated to some degree.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.860]   Maybe not 100%, but to some degree.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.820]   Maybe some would say that not reporting it when you had known about it for over a year
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.280]   is enough to not collect any compensation at all.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.220]   For those who think compensation should be received, how would we calculate what percentage
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.520]   should be mitigated given these set of facts?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:04.020]   In other words, how do we calculate justice minus responsibility?
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:13.660]   I hope you're beginning to see that it's not the easiest task to put into concrete numbers
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.640]   abstract concepts and principles that we normally take for granted.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:31.060]   We typically demand justice when we see injustice, but who exactly has the requisite wisdom to
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.300]   mete out such weighty matters?
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.060]   How does this concept apply to what's going on right now?
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.820]   If you've been listening to this podcast, we've been covering some issues that have
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.780]   been hitting the entire world and the church pretty hard.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.460]   People are saddened, confused, dazed, indignant.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:09.020]   Moreover, the anonymity that social media could bring has led to vile commenting, caricaturing
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:18.540]   of others or their positions, ultimately fueling suspicion and cynicism of the other.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:27.180]   Before it was almost en vogue, it was almost in style to have a close friend or friends
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:37.540]   that had differing ideological spectrums from you that is now extinct like the woolly mammoth.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:47.740]   Before we look outside of us and wag the finger in dismay, I want us to consider if we ourselves
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:58.340]   could have possibly contributed in some way, in some way, to let's just call it a dumpster
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.300]   fire that is our current state of affairs.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.580]   Because our current state of affairs in this country is a dumpster fire.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:17.820]   Is there any part we as individuals played in shaping today's society?
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:24.540]   Most poignantly, if you claim to be a Christian, the same Christian who claims to be an ambassador
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:32.860]   of a message that has the power to change minds, hearts, and lives, consider if you've
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:41.220]   been a good steward of that message, the steward that the gospel message deserves.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:53.020]   I have to tell you, as I say that, I'm inwardly cowering in shame.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:09:00.340]   In the legal theory of contributory negligence, you don't have to purposefully intend to cause
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.060]   harm in order to have compensation mitigated.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:15.940]   You just need to, as the phrase states, contribute in some negligent fashion even if the ultimate
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.500]   fault is not your own.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:27.100]   I am not saying that any one of us individually is solely responsible for where we are today
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.540]   as a nation and/or as a church.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:38.820]   What I am saying though is that we all, all of us, every single one of us, play some part.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:48.500]   And before we wag the finger at people we believe aren't getting it right, before we
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:59.180]   do that, before we wonder why the other could be so blinded, before we fill up with pride,
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:07.340]   this might be a good time and sit back and examine whether or not there is a log in our
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.940]   own eye.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.180]   And in case you're wondering how the legal theory of contributory negligence relates
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:22.300]   to what I'm saying here, since that theory applies to some wrongdoing against the plaintiff,
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:30.660]   my point is there are times we should see ourselves individually and there are times
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.140]   we should see each other collectively as one.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:44.780]   Romans 12, 3 to 13 says this, "For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:52.660]   you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to have
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.820]   sound judgment as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:03.820]   For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:10.180]   so we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members one of another.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.760]   Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:21.180]   exercise them accordingly, if prophecy according to the proportion of his faith, if service
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:28.020]   in his serving, or he who teaches in his teaching, or he who exhorts in his exhortation, he who
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:35.460]   gives with liberality, he who leads with diligence, he who shows mercy with cheerfulness.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:42.380]   Let love be without hypocrisy, abhor what is evil, cling to what is good, be devoted
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:49.300]   to one another in brotherly love, give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:57.500]   in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:05.780]   devoted to prayer, contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality."
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.020]   What a list, right?
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.560]   Has our love been without hypocrisy?
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.420]   Have we abhorred what is evil?
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.500]   Have we clung to what is good?
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.740]   Have we been devoted to one another in brotherly love?
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:32.260]   Do you think the absence of these things would produce any type of effect in you?
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.600]   Would it produce any type of effect on a group at large?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.380]   Would the degree to which we exercise these commands corporately have any effect on our
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.540]   direct surrounding area?
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:56.540]   1 Corinthians 12, 12-20 says this, "For even as the body is one and yet has many members,
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.540]   and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.340]   For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.380]   slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.260]   For the body is not one member, but many.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.700]   If the foot says, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,' it is not
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.940]   for this reason any the less a part of the body.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.300]   And if the ear says, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,' it
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.860]   is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.260]   If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.820]   If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:43.540]   But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.980]   If they were all one member, where would the body be?
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:52.980]   But now there are many members, but one body.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:14:01.660]   The body is not one member, but while there are many members, but one body, we need each
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.660]   other.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:11.620]   We are stuck with each other, and we are not allowed to just cast off each other because
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.540]   we are one body.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:21.820]   We are to love on one another, and win our brothers and sisters over as opposed to seeing
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.460]   the other as just that, the other.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.620]   This is not an easy saying, and it doesn't mean that we throw judgment and discernment
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.100]   out the window.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:45.460]   However, what we should see in every human being is that imago Dei that brings inherent
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.060]   worth to every embodied soul.
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.740]   Imago Dei is Latin for the image of God.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.460]   We see that in everybody regardless of a synthetic classification.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:01.660]   Galatians 6.10 says it like this, "So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:09.660]   to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith."
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:17.860]   And we know that Paul wrote that in Galatians 6.10 because the world will know who we are
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.100]   in part by the way we love one another.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.460]   Does someone, your neighbor, your coworker, your brother or sister at church have a different
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:34.180]   view than you on masks or COVID in general?
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:40.220]   What about a differing nuanced political view on abortion or taxes, social justice, Trump,
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.500]   Biden, Republican, Democrat?
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:52.420]   Resist the urge to allow your heart to turn the corner into bitterness.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:16:01.760]   Again, I am not saying that we throw judgment and discernment out the window.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:10.900]   I am not saying everyone should become completely eclectic in a flood of hippie harmony.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:18.940]   What I am saying though is that whether you see it or not, we all played a part in where
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.140]   we are today.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:29.840]   We have all failed to grow in the way we should, to understand the Word the way we should,
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.420]   to understand the times in the way we should.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:41.540]   We have all to some degree squandered our time, our money into frivolous things, rendering
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.540]   our testimony impotent at times.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.680]   We have supposedly been students of the Word for years, yet know very little or have very
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.620]   little desire to get out of the rut that we are in.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:59.720]   Or perhaps our prayer lives have been muted for so long that we are afraid to even bring
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:08.140]   it to light and in so doing only prolong that mutedness.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.980]   Perhaps we lack the humility to acknowledge our weak areas for fear of a tarnished reputation
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.740]   in the eyes of others, wanting so badly to build our kingdom within His kingdom as if
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.460]   that were even possible.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:32.620]   As we look at how deceptive philosophies have seemingly stolen the hearts of many, it is
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:38.620]   not a bad time to be introspective.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:46.780]   Could it be, could it be, that at least in part the reason so many have become captivated
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:54.380]   to deceptive and empty philosophies is because they looked at those who purportedly held
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:18:03.340]   to a confession of truth, beauty, goodness, without the evidence of a changed life?
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:10.660]   Colossians 2, 8-9 states, "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:16.220]   and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.380]   of the world, rather than according to Christ.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:25.300]   For in Him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form."
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:32.860]   Could it be that at least in part we are wired to believe that one's actions illustrate
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.340]   their own personal beliefs and convictions?
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:42.860]   If someone is looking at you and your actions do not line up to what you profess, then why
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.060]   wouldn't someone want to look elsewhere?
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:57.700]   When we see our own house burning, it is not wrong to ask if there is some contributory
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.340]   negligence on our own part.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.820]   Do you know what you believe?
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.740]   Do you love what you believe?
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:10.440]   Does your life line up to what you believe?
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:18.380]   Titus 2, 11-14 states, "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:25.140]   men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.620]   and godly in the present age, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:35.260]   glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:42.020]   every lawless deed and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.340]   good deeds."
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:50.100]   I want to render a challenge to you.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:20:01.580]   A sign of true maturity is when what you take the most pleasure in lines up with what is
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.860]   eternally good and that is what you are also immersed in.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.420]   I want to say that again.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:19.740]   A sign of true maturity is when what you take the most pleasure in lines up with what is
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:26.020]   eternally good and that is what you are most immersed in.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:32.860]   I want to read to you Philippians 3, 7-15, "But whatever things were gained to me, those
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.300]   things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.340]   More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:46.700]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.880]   rubbish, so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.180]   of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:02.300]   which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.100]   and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, in order that I may
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.500]   attain to the resurrection from the dead.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.780]   Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:22.100]   that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:30.500]   Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing I do, forgetting
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:38.340]   what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.460]   the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:49.740]   Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude, and if in anything you
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:58.060]   have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you."
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.740]   Did you catch what Paul said right here at the end?
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:10.740]   He says, "If you are perfect, then you will also adopt the same attitude as Paul."
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.940]   And if you think differently, if you have a different attitude than Paul, he doesn't
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.180]   say, "Agree to disagree."
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.140]   No, he doesn't say that at all.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:27.860]   He says, "If you think differently, well then, God will show you."
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.860]   God will show you.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:39.900]   Meaning, what he's stating is exclusively the right way to think about Christian maturity.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:47.620]   Paul is not saying, "This is a different level of maturity that is optional."
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:56.380]   He's saying, "If in anything you think differently, well, God will reveal, essentially, that you
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.380]   are wrong."
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.500]   That is a high calling.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.700]   It is an extremely lofty calling.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:16.900]   But it is completely consistent in the sense that we are called to live a life worthy of
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:23.100]   the calling that we have received.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.740]   Do not be overwhelmed by this.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:35.780]   If you seek him, he will provide you with all the resources that are necessary.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.740]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.620]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:24:06.140]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:12.980]   Amen.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:19.740]   Amen.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.320]   (upbeat music)
