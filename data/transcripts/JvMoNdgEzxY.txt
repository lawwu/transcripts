[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   If someone has trouble because they're reading from the LSB but
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.200]   their pastor is not preaching from it, I think it's pretty
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.520]   easy to adapt your understanding.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.800]   Most English translations are close enough to one another that
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.900]   you can follow along as the pastor reads from whatever
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.200]   version.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.560]   Relatively very few places where the meaning would be
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.360]   substantially changed by a different translation.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.920]   There are a few of those but I think even highlighting that is
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.000]   helpful because it motivates people to go back and consult
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.920]   even if they don't understand the original languages they can
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.720]   consult a commentary and understand why these
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   translations are different and sometimes that brings out an
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.520]   important nuance of meaning.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.160]   I think it actually helps read the text critically when you
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.020]   notice that there are differences from translation to
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.720]   translation.
