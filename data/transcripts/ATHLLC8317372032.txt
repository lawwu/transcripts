[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.640]   You heard about it here again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.760]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.560]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited you're here today.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.120]   It's a bit crazy to think that I'm already at episode 50.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.800]   For those of you who've been with me on the journey, thank you so much for
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.360]   listening.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.080]   And for those of you who are new today, looking to upgrade your own life,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.680]   definitely don't miss out on the previous 49 episodes.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.480]   They cover everything from travel hacking, maximizing your credit card
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.200]   points, honing your negotiation skills, mastering your charisma, optimizing
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.120]   your health, and so much more.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.160]   I am certain that if you scroll through the archives, there will be an episode
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   that speaks to you and improves your life meaningfully.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.720]   And in today's episode, we're not only going to talk about improving our own
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   lives, but improving the lives of others, because I'm joined by my good friend,
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.560]   Adam Nash, and we're going to be talking about giving and philanthropy.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.440]   Adam is a seasoned executive, investor, and advisor.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.600]   He sits on the board at the investing company Acorns.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.240]   He teaches a personal finance for engineers course at Stanford, and he was
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.320]   previously the president and CEO at Wealthfront, though it was before my time
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.640]   there.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.560]   But most relevant to our conversation today, he is currently the co-founder and
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.360]   CEO of Daffy, a not-for-profit community built around a new and modern way to
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   give.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   It is a fantastic product that I love, and I'm not an advisor or investor in the
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.560]   company.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.960]   I am just a fan.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.000]   In our conversation, we're going to talk about all aspects of philanthropy, how
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.560]   much people give, the friction in giving, how to pick and vet charitable
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.440]   organizations, the tax benefits of being charitable, and ways to maximize those
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.160]   benefits.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880]   There is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.200]   Well, after I remind you that Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.040]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.720]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.640]   investment decisions.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.240]   Adam, thank you so much for being here.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.840]   Chris, great to be here.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   Excited to talk about all of these topics.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.840]   Awesome.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.360]   So I just want to kick us off.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.120]   What do you think is one of the biggest misconceptions people have today when it
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.000]   comes to philanthropy?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.880]   You know, there's a lot of things about philanthropy that people don't know, but
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.680]   the most common misperception in my book is that people think it's something just
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.560]   for billionaires.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.880]   They get so obsessed with what billionaires are doing with their money and how much
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.440]   they're giving.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.240]   It makes the news, it's in your feed.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.360]   You don't realize that actually the research shows that almost everyone gives.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.520]   Almost everyone was raised to believe that to be a good person, you remember that no
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   matter what's going on in your life, there are people out there less fortunate than
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.480]   yourself, right?
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.520]   And that everyone can make a difference.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   And the data backs it up, right?
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.680]   In the U.S., somewhere between 60 to 70 million households every year give
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   proportionally.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.520]   People with less money actually give a higher percentage of their income and wealth
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   than wealthier people.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.280]   But the conversation tends to be dominated by a few billionaires when really, from my
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.560]   point of view, what's helpful for people is understanding what you can do and what
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.880]   you should do and what makes you feel good to do.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.280]   And so that's probably the biggest misperception I see out there when I talk
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.880]   about giving.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.840]   One of my favorite stats, I guess it's not a stat, but a piece of research on giving
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.360]   was from a book called Happy Money.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.880]   And if you haven't read it, they try to break down like things you can use your
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.760]   money for to be happy and giving is one of them and helping others.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080]   Is there any kind of framework that's generic enough to apply to anyone about how
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.840]   to think about giving or how much to give?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.520]   I don't know if there's one answer, but it's funny, I actually just wrote a post
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   about this a few weeks ago about my own personal experience, which I actually have
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.800]   found that is shared with a number of people.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   It was about 10, 11 years ago that LinkedIn went public and I was the head of product
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.360]   there for a number of years.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.160]   So that was actually my first exposure to a donor advised fund, like an account
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   dedicated for charity.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.720]   And the minute you have to open one of these accounts, you face this question that you
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.480]   don't know, which is like, well, how much do I put in there?
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.280]   How much do I give to charity?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.600]   And it sounds like such a simple question.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.880]   My accountant said it was simple, right?
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.120]   You know, you've had a big year.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.240]   LinkedIn's going public.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.480]   Think about how much you give to charity every year and multiply it by 10.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.960]   And that's a good place to start for funding your account.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.640]   But that didn't make it any easier because I don't know how much I gave to charity
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.960]   every year. I could look at my quicken.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.760]   I'm like one of these old time people like I have a quicken file that goes back to
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.840]   1994, so I actually can go back and look at these things and what my spending is.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.000]   But it actually was a great moment for me and my wife to actually talk about what we
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240]   wanted to give and how we thought about it.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.120]   The biggest thing I advocate for people and recommend is just to have a goal, just
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.400]   have a number, right?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.920]   Like we have goals for all sorts of things.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.880]   You and I both know, right, like saving for retirement, saving for college, saving for
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.640]   a house. There's two things that you do to make that one is you actually figure out
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.600]   what your goal is. And second, you automate it.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.040]   Right. And giving can be the same way.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.320]   And so that question of how much you should give actually was amazing.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.440]   Doing user research for Daffy, I had the chance to ask dozens and dozens of people
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.160]   what they think they should give to charity every year.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.800]   And the amazing thing is that almost no one agrees.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.200]   Like some people use percentages, some people use numbers, big numbers, small numbers.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.040]   For some people, it's about where they are in life and if they can afford to do it.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.800]   But the thing that was universal is that actually almost everyone does have an opinion
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.920]   about it. And almost everyone I talked to thought it should be something, not nothing.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.200]   Okay. And so I try not to be prescriptive to people on how much they should give as
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   much as asking them how much they think they should give every year and actually spend
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.920]   a little bit of time setting that goal.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   And then, of course, we all know great ways to stick to goals once we set them.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.680]   Yeah. Automation is great.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.440]   Are there benchmarks even for people who are not sure what's even normal?
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.400]   You know, the data actually exists.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.600]   Right. So the IRS publishes data every year based on zip code and a number of different
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.440]   factors about how much giving happens.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.600]   There are also private institutions.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.120]   I'm actually an investor in one private company called Zest is This for Nonprofits, etc.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.640]   So the data is out there, but almost no one accesses it.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.200]   It's not easy to come by.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.120]   In fact, one of the features we put into our initial release is that it's a mobile app.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.600]   Right. So based on the zip code, the city or state you're in, we tell you what the median
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.240]   household in your city gives to charity every year.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.480]   OK, but it's a very natural question.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   I think most of us want to be good people.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.760]   We want to do the right thing.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.280]   I actually think one of the problems in philanthropy is that there isn't enough
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.520]   information available to people.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.360]   Right. Like think about how many calculators there are out there that help people figure
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.320]   out how much they should save for retirement or save for college or how much they need
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.640]   to do to buy a house.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.360]   There's probably too many of those calculators out there, too many articles.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.120]   But when it comes to giving, it's all amorphous.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.200]   The only data you see published tends to be about the largest gifts.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.640]   I mean, maybe if you go to university, right, like and you get the alumni booklet, you can
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.920]   see the tiers of who's giving and how much.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   But we really don't have a lot of information about it.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.640]   I think it makes us all a little uncomfortable.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.000]   And we feel a little guilty, I think, because we don't know if we're doing enough or
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.280]   doing the right amount. And I think that most of us want to do the right thing.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.760]   Well, it sounds like the the best part is if you're just doing it, that's great.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.320]   And similar to saving, when I give people advice for saving, I say, well, first off,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.360]   just start saving. And then if you're not sure what to do, start small.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   And if it feels like you could do more, increase your savings rate.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.320]   And I assume you could just apply a similar metric there.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.560]   I don't know how much I can afford to give, but I know I could give a hundred dollars a
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.720]   month. It's like, great, do that at the end of the year or at the end of six months.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.760]   Does that feel low? Maybe try to increase the number if it does.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.800]   If it feels like too much, you can dial it back.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   But just starting somewhere and tracking it might give you some place to kind of compare
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.080]   and contrast what changes you'd make in the future.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.760]   Yeah, I can't agree more.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.360]   This is one of the things I love about this space is I think we've learned a lot in the
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.760]   last 10 or 20 years about how to help people save, how to help people invest, how to help
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320]   people hit their financial goals.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.840]   I'm really excited about this idea of applying all those lessons to philanthropy, to
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.480]   giving. And most of those lessons apply.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.840]   So, yeah, just get started, right?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.480]   Like, how should I get started saving for retirement?
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.360]   The first thing to do is actually to start saving for retirement.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.880]   And the rest comes pretty naturally.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.840]   And I think with giving, it's even better than saving or investing in a number of ways.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.160]   I mean, I love saving and investing.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.840]   Let's be clear. I do.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.440]   But when you give money and you feel that your money went somewhere, had a real impact
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.840]   on real people, on something you care about, it's a different kind of reward.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.760]   And so I actually agree with your advice.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.560]   I think that you get started giving to cause to an organization you care about, right?
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.480]   Not just a checkbox on a window, something that you actually meaningfully care about.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.440]   And no matter how much the amount is, it can be just a few dollars.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.120]   In general, when you do it, it's a good experience.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.840]   And most people want to do it again.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.360]   And so, yeah, getting started.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.160]   Well, that's that's the right place to start.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.400]   I remember I had given to a charity water birthday thing, which was all the rage maybe
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.760]   five, 10 years ago.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.280]   And then they tracked you and said, hey, here's that well that your money a year or two
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.880]   ago contribute to opening.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.840]   And I remember, oh, wow, that felt really good.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.400]   And that level of kind of follow through from the organization was really cool.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.040]   One of the questions I think a lot of people have is how do you even decide whether an
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.880]   organization you might want to give to is a responsible one, is going to follow through
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.600]   and use the money wisely?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.520]   I know there's some sites with ratings, but is that the best way to do it?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.040]   Is there a way you recommend people do diligence if they're thinking about where to give?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.440]   Well, I think this is another problem that people have and talk about is while everyone
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.680]   wants to give, everyone has a little bit of an anxiety of, well, how do I know that this
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   organization is legitimate?
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.720]   How do I know if this organization is good?
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.880]   And then, of course, is it where my money will be best spent?
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.680]   There are a lot of sites and there's a lot of information available.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.080]   Once again, the IRS does publish a list of all the valid registered charities for the
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   most part in the US.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.240]   But this gets back to us a problem we have in the US in general, which is that we're
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.480]   not comfortable talking about money with each other.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   We don't talk about giving as well.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.160]   I mean, the reason those birthday campaigns are so effective on Facebook and work is because
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.520]   actually it turns out it's not just social proof.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.560]   It's that if you know the person and they think that that charity is good one, well,
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.240]   you've outsourced a little bit of that validation, right?
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.880]   Their reputation, your relationship, you decide to say, well, this is clearly a good enough
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.320]   organization for them and it's meaningful to them and I will support them.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.560]   And it also feels good to give.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.680]   And so I do think that that is part of the process.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.080]   I think people should be less afraid to ask each other what organizations and causes they
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   support.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.840]   I think people should be less afraid to share the organizations that they personally support
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   and why.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.600]   I mean, last year in the fall on Twitter, I did campaigns for different events where
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.280]   I talked about some of the charities that I support.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.000]   I even did matching campaigns where I said, you know, hey, everyone for this month, if
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.560]   you give to this charity, like I'll match it type of thing, which you've probably seen
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.100]   on Twitter from a lot of celebrities and other folks.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.520]   And I think there's a lot of value to that and elevating these charities.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.720]   If you talk to the folks who run these charities, they're desperate for people to talk more
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   about what they do.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.920]   Like there's no amount of marketing they can do that really has the same impact of actual
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.480]   validation and endorsement from people who believe in that charity, believe in that cause.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.920]   But yes, for people who want to look at the data, there are a number of sites that do
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.560]   good jobs of ratings and percentages.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.360]   We built them into Daffy, for example, but there's a number of other sites that do this
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.000]   charity Navigator and other ones.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.360]   And I think it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.200]   I'd also encourage people to consider giving locally, right?
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.920]   Some great organizations are within a mile of where you live, of where you work.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   And it's not that hard to find local organizations and certainly not that hard to check them
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.000]   out and validate them.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.240]   But many people tend to just stick to the big names that they've heard of, right?
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.320]   Because they think that they're safer, right?
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.880]   Like they've heard of this organization, it's been around for decades.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.200]   Once again, this gets back to whatever gives you comfort giving probably is a good thing.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.360]   The odds of you giving money to a bad organization are much, much lower than the odds of you
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.080]   just not getting over the hump to give at all.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.400]   And remember, that is the point.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.900]   The point is to get resources to people and to causes that you believe in.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.280]   - We talked briefly about how to pick a number, but do you believe people could be giving
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   more?
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   - It depends how you look at it.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.320]   I mean, the US is known in philanthropy circles as a very generous nation.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.280]   And that's because if you look at the percent of our economy that we actually give, it's
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.280]   very high.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.040]   So in 2020, it was $471 billion in the US.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.480]   That roughly worked out to be about 2.3% of GDP.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   That's a big number.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.360]   I mean, all of agriculture is less than 1% of GDP in the US.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.920]   So that's a very big number.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.800]   And so you could ask the question, like, why do other countries give less or give more?
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.920]   Is it about economics, does it tie to economic inequality?
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   There's all sorts of reasons.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.520]   Is it because of religion, right?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.580]   The most common donations that people make tend to be to religious and academic institutions.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.400]   But I think overall, Americans are generous.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.560]   But when you ask the question, could we be more generous?
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.080]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   There's no question.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.720]   You know, one of the things that I was surprised to find out was that there's very good research.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.760]   You mentioned behavioral finance earlier and like automating things, etc.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:14.600]   But there is actually very good research that suggests that the amount that we want to give
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.280]   as individuals is quite a bit higher than what we actually give.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.840]   And actually, I validated this myself, just in user research, etc.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.160]   If you ask someone how much they think they should give every year, they give you a number.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.960]   You ask them how much they actually gave last year, you get a little bit of a pause, a little
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.200]   bit of guilt, because the truth is we have busy lives, right?
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.880]   We don't get around to it.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:45.240]   And so it turns out this research says that we would give about 32% more if we actually
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.480]   just gave the amount that we think we should, like not even stretching ourselves, not pushing
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.140]   us to give more than we think we should.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.360]   Just if you're the type of person who thinks you should give a few hundred dollars to charity
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.720]   every year, or a few thousand dollars, or whatever your number is, it turns out for
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.680]   the most part, we don't stick to it.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.280]   And I know you know this, but it's pretty obvious why.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.280]   It's the exact same reason.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.880]   Like, how much would we save for retirement if you had to write a check or manually make
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   the transaction?
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.040]   We all know that it's like, no, no, no, have the 401k come out of your paycheck, right?
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.000]   That actually helps people stick to a plan.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.020]   And it hasn't been applied to giving.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.340]   But yeah, definitely we could all give more, even though we do give a lot.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:29.600]   And like I said, if you look at it, that $471 billion, over $330 billion of that is from
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.520]   individuals, right?
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.480]   These aren't foundations and corporations giving all sorts of money.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.480]   I mean, they are.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.360]   I mean, more than $100 billion a year.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   But individuals are generous.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.920]   I think they would be more generous, though, if they came up with a system for giving.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.520]   Are there other hurdles or barriers other than just the hassle of following through?
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.160]   Is it finding the right places or what do you think else holds people back?
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   So you bring up a good question.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.320]   You actually brought up some of the issues earlier, which I agree with.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.320]   I'm a product person at heart, right?
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.220]   So I think of product problems.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.000]   And when I looked at giving, it was very clear to me that at minimum, giving is two very
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.840]   hard problems for people.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.180]   There's the how much can I afford to give, right?
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.180]   Which is a hard problem.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.480]   I guess that's tied a little bit to how much you should give.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.580]   But people are not very good at budgeting.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.760]   They're not very good at allocating numbers, not even very good at understanding what their
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.020]   income is or their expenses are.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.160]   So there's this hard problem of how much to give.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.800]   And there's a second set of hard problems around who to give it to.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.560]   And this is actually one of the reasons I actually really love the idea of separating
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.080]   those two problems.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.300]   So to our earlier conversation, I think the best thing you could do for that first problem
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.500]   is just set a goal and put money aside for charity, just like you put money aside for
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.940]   a number of other things.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.640]   Have it somewhere separate so that when people ask you to give or when you find an organization
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.680]   or cause you believe in, you're not struggling with that first question of how much you can
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   afford.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.940]   You already have it set aside.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.740]   It's there for you.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.720]   That second question, though, of who to give it to, I don't think there's any shortcut
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   there.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.840]   I think social information can help, knowing who your friends and colleagues give to.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   I think research can help, but I think the truth is most people build those relationships
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.340]   over time.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.200]   And that's actually very good for nonprofits because the truth is they don't want a donation
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.380]   from you just once.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.980]   Most of these organizations have budgets they have to run every year.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.300]   So what they really want from someone who supports them is someone who's going to support
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.580]   them regularly.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.440]   They would probably much rather get money from you, a smaller amount, regularly every
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.420]   year than a one-time birthday raise where they never see that money again.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.300]   It's the reason that nonprofits actually spend a lot of money and time fundraising.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.840]   It's a very heavy sales process for them because it's very transactional.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.660]   They always have to convince someone to reach in their wallet, pull out some money, give
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.780]   it to them.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.540]   It's a very hard process to get through.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.060]   So I tend to recommend people that not feel the pressure to give all the money away at
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.820]   once as much as build these relationships, find organizations that you support, be comfortable
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.620]   supporting them, give them your regular support.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.500]   And over time, you'll add more and more organizations.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.700]   One thing I learned when I was going through this process myself of just evaluating some
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:20.540]   organizations is there isn't a lot of information about every organization.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.260]   Not only do they have to file, I'm going to maybe get it wrong, is it a 990?
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.260]   Is that the right number?
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.260]   That's right.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.260]   With the IRS.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.820]   So there's a document that's, "Here's who we are.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   Here's how much we spend.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.820]   Here's our expenses.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.300]   Here's how much we pay our directors."
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:38.220]   But almost all of them also have annual reports summarizing the impact they had.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.300]   So if there's an organization, I would say there might be charity scams.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.900]   I'm sure there are, but there is a lot of validating places like IRS websites, validating
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.220]   the tax ID numbers to make sure that you're giving to somewhere good.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.580]   And there's just a lot of content about who and what is happening within an organization.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.620]   So as much as someone might say like, "I don't know about this organization."
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.700]   I feel like it's, if you're thinking that in your head, I feel like it's not a great
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.500]   excuse because there is information out there.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.260]   And with the advent of the internet, it's never been easier to find it.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.260]   I agree with you.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.300]   I think it's not hard to get to conviction about different organizations, given how much
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.980]   content is out there.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.860]   That being said, I understand the anxiety.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.420]   It's the same thing that happens with sensationalism in every industry, right?
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.180]   You only read the worst stories.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.760]   And then there've been stories over the decades of nonprofits where directors embezzled money
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.340]   or self-enriched themselves in private planes and that sort of thing.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:38.860]   So that anxiety I think is real, but to your point, it's not hard to validate local charities
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.860]   if you're really interested.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.540]   It is not hard to ask around of what charities other people support.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.420]   And certainly for the national charities, it is not hard to find ample information about
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   them.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.580]   And so I think it's a solvable problem.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.620]   I don't want to pretend it's not a problem.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.780]   I think it's reasonable for people to have questions of where they're sending money.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.980]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.260]   I mean, it's very funny.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.420]   The amount of research people want to do to send a hundred dollar donation somehow is
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:07.780]   a lot higher than the amount of research they do before grabbing that random ad on Instagram
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.780]   for a hundred dollars.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.620]   This is actually one of the opportunities I think in the industry is there's no real reason
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.780]   it has to be that way.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.060]   For some reason, we've convinced people that buying that random item on Instagram, that
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.960]   they can just do that with tap, tap, tap.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.420]   We should make giving that easy.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.980]   There are reasons why you can't trust a random company on the internet.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.780]   One of my first jobs on the internet was at eBay.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.340]   And believe it or not, there was a time where it seemed crazy that you would buy something
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.460]   from a stranger that you'd never met and you would send them money and just you'd assume
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.780]   that the item would be good and not broken, like as represented.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:46.080]   We take it for granted now, but that seemed ludicrous 20, 30 years ago.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.780]   I think that some of that friction we got rid of, like people now trust for the most
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.780]   part e-commerce.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.980]   Now, sometimes bad things happen.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   There's no question.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.340]   I've made a purchase or two online that turned out to be a mistake, but I think there's no
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:03.040]   reason why we can't use the same techniques to give people confidence that, hey, if you
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.540]   want to send a gift for a cause or to an organization, we've already filtered them.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.440]   It's going to be fine.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.320]   It's going to be a very rare situation where something goes wrong.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.580]   In the most common case, you will have helped real people with something that matters.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:24.680]   One tactic I had, so in the past month, there's been a lot of giving support for Ukraine.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.060]   And I was thinking, gosh, I had never done any research about nonprofits that support
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.060]   Ukraine.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.580]   That was just not something that last year or any previous year had come across my radar.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.900]   And one option was, okay, well, let's spend a lot of time to figure this out.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.700]   And what I ended up doing was through both, I think, some of your posts, other people's
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.440]   posts, I came up with a list of 10 organizations, I took how much I wanted to get, I divided
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   by 10.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.760]   And I was like, "Look, if one of these organizations isn't as great as the other, well, I gave
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   to all 10.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   So it's okay."
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.340]   I played the diversification game.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.700]   I crowdsourced the information from friends, from people online, from articles, and gave
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.020]   to all of them.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.820]   And I know that probably doesn't bode well for the recurring ongoing relationship.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.220]   But if you're out there thinking, "Gosh, I want to give to this cause, and I'm not sure
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.740]   how," and you don't want to do the research, maybe pick five organizations that do it.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.780]   And the risk that one is bad is now one-fifth as much.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:27.700]   But I would guess if you look at the numbers, the risk is already very, very small.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   The risk is small.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.340]   And more importantly, I think we have a situation like Ukraine, more important for the bias
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.980]   just to be to help, to give, to do something rather than nothing.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.140]   And so your process sounds good.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.260]   I mean, we did a Daffy tweet out a list of nonprofits that we thought were well-researched
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.120]   and advocated by other institutions.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.620]   This is one of these areas that on the one hand, I say, "Listen, yeah, the most important
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.940]   thing is you find institutions."
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.980]   I actually like the idea of portfolios or several institutions in an area.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.880]   I think that there's something very interesting there for people, I think, about not picking
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.660]   one organization to give to that actually might make it easier to give.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.380]   But at the same time, it's still too hard.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.860]   We're not all experts.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.380]   But I think what you did sounds like the right thing to do.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.620]   They're reputable sources, crowdsource a list, come up with the amount you want to give,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.000]   and whether you split it across different organizations or give it to one, the point
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.540]   is you've actually helped.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.940]   And we can debate how much, but you've helped.
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.940]   And it made it easier.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.940]   It was funny.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.940]   I'd find another one.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.780]   I decided an amount and split it amongst 10, and then an 11th popped up.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.100]   And I was like, "Wow, I can't not give to the 11th.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.420]   This one looks good too."
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.900]   So then I ended up giving 10% more to that 11th one than I'd originally planned, and
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.900]   it felt great.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.620]   So I want to take a little bit of a turn.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.280]   Okay.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.460]   If you've been listening to this episode, you already know that I'm a huge fan of Daffy.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.460]   They're a not-for-profit community built around a new modern way to give, and they have a
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:02.060]   mission I think we can all get behind, helping people be more generous more often.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.440]   A Daffy account makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.180]   You can make a one-time contribution, or you can set a little aside each week, month, or
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.180]   quarter.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:16.820]   And because Daffy Charitable Fund is a registered 501(c)(3), all your contributions are tax-deductible.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:23.580]   Then, whenever you want, you can give to more than 1.5 million charities, schools, and faith-based
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.020]   organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:31.540]   So you can separate the decision to give and get your tax deduction from deciding exactly
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.780]   which organization you want to support.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.820]   And my favorite part is that all the contributions to your Daffy account are invested in a standard
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.580]   ESG or crypto portfolio, so they can grow tax-free to let you have even more impact
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.580]   in the future.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.500]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today, and for a
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.780]   limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the charity
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.780]   of your choice.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:03.260]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.820]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.820]   I get it.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.380]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.420]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.500]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.300]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.060]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.840]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.700]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.860]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.700]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.300]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:47.180]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:51.220]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.400]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.300]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.660]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.420]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.460]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.460]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.900]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.940]   And talk about, you know, this is all the hacks.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.940]   One of the things that's interesting for people who have W-2 income is that there aren't a
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.540]   lot of hacks, right?
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.060]   I get lots of questions.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   "I have a job.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.420]   What are the hacks to save money on my taxes?"
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.660]   And I'm like, "Well, okay."
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.660]   So it's like retirement accounts, pre-tax accounts, like HSAs and FSAs, and charitable
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.660]   donations.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.140]   If I'm missing anything, let me know.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:46.780]   I know there's some technical high-end trust stuff, but for the broad strokes...
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:53.540]   And I think I find that people often misunderstand what some of these tax deductions, how they
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.540]   work.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.820]   Can you, on a high level, explain the tax benefits the government offers people for
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.820]   being charitable?
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.820]   And I want to be careful.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.140]   I'm obviously not an accountant, as it turns out.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.140]   So I'm sure they are.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.140]   Of course.
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.140]   Me either.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.140]   I don't have to make a disclosure here, but I will.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.900]   Do not take what I'm giving you as financial advice.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.860]   Not a professional accountant, etc.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.460]   But no, actually, it's well known that the charitable deduction in the U.S. is one of
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.660]   the most generous.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:24.020]   And the reason it's generous is because it actually is a deduction against AGI, against
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.220]   your income, which tends to have the highest tax rates.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.180]   And so it's a very useful deduction.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:35.980]   You can deduct right now up to 50% of your AGI, actually, in some cases, 60%, which is
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.340]   a really high number.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.140]   If you think about where most deductions tap up now, the one catch is you have to be someone
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.300]   who itemizes their deductions.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.980]   And ever since the 2017 Tax Act, there are fewer people now.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   But for most people who live in high-tax states who have a mortgage, they probably itemized
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.460]   deductions or could very quickly if you make a charitable deduction.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.500]   So the great thing about charitable deductions is that they are an incredible benefit from
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   taxes.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.140]   The problem is, as you know, the tax year is one year.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:13.580]   And because our tax rates go up, our system isn't very good for dealing with what happens
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.380]   when people have lumpy income, right?
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.820]   You have big years, you have down years, even though that's becoming more and more common
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.460]   across the United States.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.140]   People's income isn't steady every year.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.060]   There really are good years and bad years.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.900]   The charitable deduction is most valuable in those good years, right?
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.920]   Because those are years when you tend to be worried about taxes.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.340]   But that stresses that other part of the problem, which is, wait, do you know who to give the
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.620]   money to?
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.220]   And that actually catches a lot of people.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.900]   There's a lot of people in November, December, who realize that they had a good year, that
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.320]   their tax bill is going to be higher than expected and say, "Wow, this would really
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.540]   be a good time to give some money to charity."
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.380]   But unfortunately, they don't have enough time to pick a charity.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.340]   And that's where donor advised funds come in.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.420]   Donor advised funds are basically a special type of account.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.820]   You know, the way that an IRA is for retirement and a 529 is for college savings, a donor
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.880]   advised fund is for charity.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.700]   And the great thing about donor advised funds is because they're offered by nonprofits,
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.880]   by charities, you get a tax deduction immediately when you put the money in the account.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:25.120]   And so as a result, the best tax hack around charitable deductions is to make that commitment
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.700]   to give, put the money in a donor advised fund, get the tax deduction.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.880]   And then you have time to figure out which organizations to give it to.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.160]   And then for many of these donor advised funds, that money can be invested.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.200]   So it's not sitting idle while you're figuring out who to give to.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.940]   The money is still invested and growing, but now tax deferred, like a Roth IRA or another
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.060]   tax deferred account.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.120]   My first experience with donor advised funds came in the scenario you described where I
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.080]   was like, "Oh, it's a higher tax year, which is always a good year."
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.620]   And I was like, "Gosh, we should just donate."
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.920]   And funny enough, you said earlier, your advice from your accountant was 10 years.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.080]   My advice was also like, "Well, I don't know how much to give, but this is a higher tax
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   year.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.840]   I'd rather give next year's donations this year.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.700]   And I'd probably rather give the next year's donations this year."
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.800]   And I was like, "Well, let's just go 10 years out, take what we were going to give for the
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.560]   next 10 years, which we had to figure out also, because we didn't even have a number
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   at the time.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.640]   And we put that in a donor advised fund.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.720]   And I learned a few things in the process.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.420]   And I want to get to one in a minute, which is about donating the most appreciated things
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.420]   in your portfolio.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.920]   And we could talk about why.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:37.120]   I also learned that even organizations that seemed like they had decent products at the
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.640]   time when this happened, Vanguard, Fidelity, they had websites, you could log in, you could
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.640]   buy stocks, and then I logged into their donor advised portal, and I was like, "This is just
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.000]   a different company."
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.080]   And I think legally, it actually is a different company.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.760]   But I was blown away that the innovation on donor advised funds, even for organizations
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.220]   that have innovated their investing products, was just completely absent.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.840]   I assume that might be part of the founding story here.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   But what about the industry did you find that made you say, "We should go build something,"
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.800]   despite there being lots of organizations out there?
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.720]   Well, there's a lot of reasons.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.760]   I think there's two things that lead to the effect that you saw with existing donor advised
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   funds.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   One that's pretty simple, and one that's probably more nuanced.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.040]   The simple reason why it is true is that to offer a donor advised fund, you have to be
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.020]   a nonprofit, right?
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:30.120]   But nonprofits have trouble investing in technology and operations and all the things that they
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.800]   need to do to run a donor advised fund.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.720]   So they almost always partner with a for-profit company that helps them operate and kind of
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.680]   fund the development of the firm.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.400]   And so Fidelity Charitable partners with Fidelity Investments, Schwab Charitable with Schwab,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.560]   of course Vanguard Charitable partners with Vanguard.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.900]   And so they're all partnered with investment firms, right?
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.900]   Not technology firms.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.560]   And so it is a little bit of the founding story with DAFI.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.600]   DAFI, of course, stands for the Donor Advised Fund for You.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.320]   But we said, "Well, what if instead of partnering with an investment firm, you partnered with
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.980]   a venture-backed technology company, right?
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.660]   Could you have the same type of engineers, the same type of quality design that we're
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:14.340]   used to seeing from Facebook and Google and Apple and the best kind of companies in the
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.340]   industry?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.460]   Could we see that here?"
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.460]   And so that's a little bit of the founding story.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.800]   The second reason, though, is more subtle, which is that because they've partnered with
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.820]   investment firms, almost every donor advised fund out there, their business model is charging
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.400]   you a percent of assets.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   And that sounds fun.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.300]   It's a very normal thing in the investment industry, right?
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.380]   Even Vanguard does it, right?
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.820]   A percent of your fund.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:40.460]   The problem there, though, is that because they are charging a percent of assets, they
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.180]   really are only interested in very large accounts, right?
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.800]   And so when you think about this, like, you might have a large account, say, for retirement.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.220]   It's your whole retirement.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.220]   College is expensive.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.940]   You might save a lot for college.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:59.420]   You have to be very wealthy to have six and seven-figure or even bigger accounts allocated
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.420]   for charity.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.820]   I mean, it's fantastic, but that's a very big number to put out there.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:10.300]   And so as a result, those firms mostly optimize their services around the very wealthy, those
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   biggest accounts.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.540]   I mean, Vanguard, I love Vanguard.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.240]   It's one of my favorite firms, changed the industry, idolized.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.900]   But even their donor advised fund, you can't even open with less than $25,000.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.980]   That's their minimum.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:27.140]   And they charge 60 basis points all the way up to $500,000.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.320]   And so I think that's the other problem that you see, that the reason they don't invest
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.480]   in technology heavily there is they're not hitting a mass market audience.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.300]   They're mostly hitting people who already have financial advisors and accountants who
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.820]   probably do it for them.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.820]   That makes sense.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:47.080]   And is the reason why a firm like Vanguard, which is known for low fees and for their
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:52.060]   consumer products, doesn't charge as high as 60 basis points, can they get away with
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:58.360]   it because it's already money that's been given away and there's just not as much scrutiny
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.500]   over the fees?
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.940]   Because it's like, "Look, I'm going to give away, in their case, $25,000.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.420]   The fees are coming out of money that's not mine anymore.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.020]   I'm not paying the fees.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.580]   They're coming out of what would otherwise go to charity."
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.980]   Does that make people less frustrated with high fees or how are they a firm like Vanguard
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.860]   getting away with charging so much when I can't imagine there's a lot more overhead
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.380]   to operate this than a regular investment account?
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.460]   Well, let's be clear.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:29.240]   I think Vanguard has such a great corporate culture and structurally set up.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.780]   I don't think that those are their motivations, right?
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.820]   I think there are other real reasons where because of their lack of investment in technology
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.460]   and because of the way they run their donor advice fund, it might actually be very expensive
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.100]   for them to operate.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.900]   And so those fees actually reflect their costs.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.860]   But I do think that some of the things you talked about are correct.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.700]   I think there is a problem.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.020]   We've all grown up through this industry.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.420]   There was a time where people didn't know to look at how much their mutual funds were
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.880]   charging them.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.180]   And we had to socialize this idea of actually looking at the expense ratios, right?
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.060]   And all the fees tied with mutual funds, 401(k)s.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.340]   We had to teach people to look at the fees around 401(k)s.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.500]   Advisors, how much is your advisor charging?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.380]   I've asked dozens of people how much they're paying for their donor advice fund.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.900]   Most people don't even know.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.300]   It's not on the account statement.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.740]   There's no number there.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:22.360]   I've talked to people who are paying literally hundreds of dollars, even thousands of dollars
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.700]   a year for their donor advice fund, but they don't even know it.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.660]   So I do think that with most donor advice funds, the reason they charge what they do
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.580]   is because they can.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:36.340]   The tax benefit is high enough that it usually is a net positive for wealthy people who open
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.740]   donor advice funds, right?
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.580]   So if you were lucky enough to have stock in one of the companies that went public in
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.460]   the last couple of years, or you invested in crypto, right, so you have Bitcoin that
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.220]   you bought for $1,000, that's now worth $41,000.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.700]   There's so much tax benefit from donating those assets and not having to pay those capital
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.540]   gains taxes that it's true.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.340]   Probably the high end market for donor advice funds just isn't that fee sensitive.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.620]   But I think a lot of the problem has to do with structurally what the industry has done
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.620]   to date.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.860]   And you're right, at Daffy, we're hoping to change that.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:15.620]   And you mentioned donating those appreciated assets, could you walk through maybe an example
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.500]   of the kind of impact donating something that's been appreciated would have on your kind of
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.580]   financial situation and, and the impact it would have on the organizations that it would
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.620]   ultimately go to?
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.940]   The reason the benefit of donating assets is because you really win both ways.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.400]   We already talked about the fact that the charitable deduction is a great deduction
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   to have, right?
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:39.260]   So if you were going to donate $1,000, getting $1,000 off your income on your taxes, I mean,
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.060]   especially if you're in a high tax state like California, New York, etc, that can be more
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.060]   than 50%.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.240]   That's a huge number in the aggregate federal state, etc.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:55.260]   But when you donate an appreciated asset, stock, crypto, you never have to pay the capital
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.220]   gain as well.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:01.540]   And so it ends up being not only better for you, it ends up being better for the nonprofit.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.540]   I wrote a recent post about this with real numbers kind of running through but it's very,
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.360]   very clear, like use that Bitcoin example that I gave.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.060]   If you bought a Bitcoin for $1,000, and it's now worth $41,000, right?
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:20.180]   Well, if you sold that Bitcoin, right, you'd owe quite a bit in taxes on it, state, federal
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.700]   like capital gains, etc.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.700]   And you if you donated the money left over, you would have money left over, but it would
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.820]   be minus the taxes, right?
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:35.140]   If you donate the Bitcoin to charity, you get the full charitable deduction for that
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.420]   $41,000 amount, you never pay the capital gain.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.180]   So you have more money now to give to charity.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:46.060]   Plus, you are getting that $41,000 charitable deduction off the top.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.660]   So you're winning both ways.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.620]   So it's very clear how the numbers work out, if you are in the fortunate enough position
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:57.420]   to have appreciated assets, and you can donate those, it's better for everyone involved.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.260]   And then of course, the one problem with it is it turns out not every nonprofit is set
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.700]   up to actually accept stock or crypto.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   And this is actually one of the benefits of donor advised funds.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.300]   One of the great things about Daffy, one of our first donations was actually to a local
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   synagogue.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.500]   One of the constituents wanted to donate Bitcoin to that synagogue, the synagogue wasn't set
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:22.100]   up to take Bitcoin, but they were able to download the Daffy app, contribute the Bitcoin
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.960]   to their donor advised fund, get the full tax deduction, of course, and then they let us
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.380]   take care of actually getting the money to the synagogue.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.500]   It's a fantastic benefit.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.940]   I think most tax advisors, most financial advisors you talk to, will recommend at the
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:39.700]   end of the tax year that if you have appreciated assets, and you want to give money to charity,
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.140]   donating appreciated assets is clearly the best way to do it.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.620]   I love that you can disintermediate this question, because one of my things at the end of the
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.740]   year is, okay, what in my portfolio has enough gains that it would make for a good donated
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.740]   asset?
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.520]   I mean, a stock that you might have bought 12 years ago, could almost be in anything
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.160]   if it was 12 years ago, is probably appreciated quite a bit.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.480]   And that's something that I've taken advantage of.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.160]   Or if you happen to work at a company, and you've been there a long time, and you hold
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.020]   some stock from the early days, there are circumstances I've had friends where it's
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.800]   literally almost 100% gains, and you kind of get the most maximum effect.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.160]   So I love that.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   And there's a fun hack there.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   It's actually one of the examples I use.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.380]   So my first job out of school was actually at Apple.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.580]   Maybe I should have held more of that stock, because it turned out the run from the 90s
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.940]   to now is once in a lifetime.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.500]   But fundamentally, yeah, for employees, people who hold company stock, it doesn't have to
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.180]   be all or nothing either, right?
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.020]   Like to use your example, if you have 500 shares of Apple, for example, and a lot of
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:44.780]   it has a lot of gains, you can donate 100 shares of Apple, get that great tax deduction.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:49.180]   And that can actually help cover the taxes from selling some of the rest of your stake,
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.780]   those other 400 shares.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.540]   And so a lot of people actually do that thinking at the end of the year, if they have an advisor,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.540]   they help them with it.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.660]   And if they do it themselves, though, it's very much thinking about, okay, what's my
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.540]   tax bill going to be?
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.540]   Do I have some appreciated assets I could donate?
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.740]   Or if I want to liquidate something, do I have other appreciated assets I can use to
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.020]   help defray some of those taxes?
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.420]   And to your point, it doesn't have to be some go go stock, it doesn't have to be Bitcoin.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:21.260]   In some years, I've actually donated old ETF shares of VTI that I've had for a long time,
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.420]   because it has appreciated quite a bit and has a very low cost basis.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.340]   So once you get that in your head, you realize it's something you probably should do every
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.340]   year, right?
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.500]   Sometime between Thanksgiving, and the New Year's, you should probably think about what
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.480]   your taxes are going to be.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.380]   If they're going to be higher than you expected, think about is this a good time to give money
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.380]   to charity?
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.540]   And if it is look for appreciated assets to do it and then just put it in a donor advised
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.660]   fund.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.060]   And now you have an account dedicated to charity.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:52.100]   So anytime you want to give you have money already set up to do so.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.540]   It's almost like the opposite is you've got tax loss harvesting, and then you've got tax
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.660]   gain harvesting for the purpose of donating.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.660]   Yeah, this is this is exactly right.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.260]   And you know, I know you're a Wealthfront and I have always will have a soft spot for
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.260]   Wealthfront, etc.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.460]   One of the things we learned at Wealthfront is that people don't always think of the tax
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.100]   liability that's sitting in the shares they own, right?
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.500]   They remember what they bought the stock at or what they bought crypto at, they know where
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.780]   it is now.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.140]   They don't think enough about what the taxes are going to be when they sell it, because
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.180]   it turns out you have to pay them.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.740]   Once you have this idea that, oh, I can donate assets to charity, it doesn't have to just
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.340]   be cash.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.260]   It really opens up your thinking of how to make sure that, you know, you invest for the
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.740]   long term, you have these assets with a low cost basis.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.220]   And then you can do a lot of good with them by donating them to charity.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:43.140]   If you have, like I did, a donor advised fund already at another institution, you could
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.780]   donate that to another donor advised fund.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.180]   So Fidelity Charitable, if you're listening, sorry, I no longer have a donor advised fund
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.180]   with you.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.180]   I moved it all to Daffy.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.660]   So that was one thing that I didn't realize, because it is also another charity.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.900]   So you can move them around.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.260]   So while you can never get the money out, right, you've donated it, it's irrevocable,
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.260]   you can move it to another donor advised fund.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.820]   So you're not locked into whatever you're using today.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.180]   Yeah, this is another thing.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.700]   You know, I remember one of the things that's kind of the bane of the industry a little
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.540]   bit is somehow rolling over 401ks is still incredibly difficult.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.820]   We've been talking about this for decades.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:19.140]   But somehow, the firms that hold 401ks just make it really, really hard to get your own
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.480]   money to another institution.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.580]   Donor advised funds aren't quite as bad, but they really do not make it obvious that if
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:29.900]   you ever want to move any of the money, you can move all of it, you can move some of it,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.380]   you can always move it to another donor advised fund.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.380]   And yes, of course, I'm biased.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.580]   You know, with Daffy, I have a lot of friends.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.580]   They have donor advised funds.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.860]   But actually, it was a feature we missed in our launch when we launched a few months ago.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.460]   We didn't have support in the app for transfers.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.020]   We now do, of course.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.700]   And it was really surprising how many people wanted to move money over and they didn't
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.700]   know how.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.700]   And it turns out it's really simple, right?
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:55.220]   If you have a donor advised fund, Daffy charitable fund has an EIN.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.420]   It's another nonprofit, you just make a grant to us.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.220]   And listen, Chris, totally appreciate moving the whole account over.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.220]   That's fantastic.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.060]   But the truth is, from our point of view, anything that makes you comfortable with is
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.060]   great.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.900]   So if you want to move over $1,000 to test it out or a few hundred dollars, if you want
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.060]   to move over half the account, it's all easy.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.660]   You just pick the amount, make the grant to Daffy charitable fund.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.860]   They end up mailing us a check.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.380]   A lot of the industry still runs on checks, as it turns out.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.420]   And we credit your account and it gets invested in your portfolio, however you selected when
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.540]   you signed up.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   It was pretty easy.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.420]   I mean, obviously, on the behind the scenes, it sounds like it was less easy and that a
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.660]   check had to go in the mail.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.940]   For me, it seemed pretty straightforward.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:36.740]   Well, you probably saved a lot of money doing it because those AUM fees are actually quite
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.020]   high.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.180]   For me, it was save money and it wasn't my money because I've already donated.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.220]   So save money for other organizations.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.720]   The other thing that I thought was interesting with the product you've built, I don't know
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.860]   how many other donor advised funds have apps, but I don't think Fidelity Charitable did.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.860]   They actually do.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.820]   Believe it or not, Fidelity Charitable, Fidelity is always well known for some of their investment
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.820]   in technology.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.920]   I realize in the brokerage industry, it's hard to give anyone the gold medal.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.520]   But Fidelity has a decent reputation for investing in technology.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.260]   But even they, they have an app where you can make donations.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.980]   But if you want to open an account, contribute, change your investments, you can't do any
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.520]   of that from the app.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.860]   When we launched Daffy, that was actually one of the big differentiators up front and
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   still is.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:23.340]   We are the only fully functional donor advised fund in the app store, one where you can open
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.260]   an account, contribute cash, stock, crypto.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:31.780]   You can invest the money and of course, make donations to any legal charity in the US.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.140]   So yeah, it's hard to believe that in 2022, that's a rare thing.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.440]   But I think that's because most people don't know about donor advised funds.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:43.340]   Like I said, historically, it's been this attach rate kind of bespoke product that advisors
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.340]   use, right?
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.580]   Like, most of the energy at the institutions for it is just a way for them to make sure
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.620]   that the assets stay with them.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.280]   Fidelity knows that if you're going to donate stock and you're going to put it into a donor
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.380]   advised fund, it's better to put it in the Fidelity donor advised fund, right?
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.880]   And they optimize for that experience.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.680]   As a result, they don't really think about the fact that a lot of people start their
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.880]   experience these days with an app, right?
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.880]   They started the app store.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.920]   They don't necessarily start it with a search or by walking into a branch.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.760]   I found that one of the great things about an app experience when it comes to donating
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.440]   was in this Ukraine example, we were like, "Oh, we found an organization."
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.400]   My wife's like, "Oh, I found this one."
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.000]   You didn't have to go to the website and type in all of your name and your billing information.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.640]   It was almost too easy.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.880]   And that's not a criticism, but it was like, "This organization, yes."
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:37.400]   And I remember sharing a note that I assumed someone that follows me could see, but it
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   was like, "Done."
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.780]   And it was like, "Okay, let's do another one."
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.080]   It made it easy enough that hopefully, it will help remove some of the friction because
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   I know it did for us.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   And I love that.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.840]   I mean, our mission as an organization, as a company is to help people be more generous
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.080]   more often.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.440]   And it's true.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:47:00.440]   Because a lot of times, we have the instinct, we have the urge to give, but all that friction
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.560]   gets in the way, right?
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.240]   I'm going to go home, I'm going to get an email, I'm going to have to go to a website.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.640]   There's all this extra work.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.880]   How often do you end up, like I have kids, I have four kids, I can't tell you how many
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   back to school nights I've been at and sat through the presentation, where, you know,
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.920]   they walk through and they have a fund, maybe it's a sport after school sports or art supplies
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.400]   or something that supports the school.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.680]   And you're like, Okay, I'm going to give to support what you write a note to yourself.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   I'm old school.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.480]   So I send myself an email so that when I get home, at some point, I remember to like go
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   to the website and donate.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.120]   But when you have the app, tap, tap, tap, you're done.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.520]   You know, in downtown Los Altos, a couple months ago, there was a minister doing a bake
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.080]   sale for his organization, which is actually in Oakland.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   And I had a great conversation with him found out more about the organization wanted to
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.260]   support them actually didn't want the bake sale because it turns out I shouldn't eat
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.160]   as many things for bake sales right now.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.640]   But I wanted to give some money and the fact that I could pull out my app, type in the
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.920]   name of his organization, put in $100, donate that money, have it go to him.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.080]   It made it easier to give.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.920]   And it actually felt great because I didn't have this thing also hanging over my head.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.360]   There was no to do item.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.960]   There was no weird anxiety.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.080]   I wasn't worried about keeping track of the donation.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.360]   I knew it was all in my app.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.340]   Actually, surprisingly, one of the features people seem to love a lot.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.680]   We just went through our first tax season.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.200]   And so just the fact that you don't have to chase down donation receipts at the end of
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.640]   the year for your account, it's amazing how many people hate whatever system they have.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.200]   They print out receipts and keep them in a folder by their desk.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.360]   They have like a Gmail search that they do.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.800]   So it just turns out to be very convenient.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.200]   I think the app is a game changer.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.560]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.760]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   Anything we missed?
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.120]   One of the things I've run into is that there are some people out there who like this idea
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:47.020]   of putting money aside for charity, like theoretically, and they like the tax benefit, but they don't
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.000]   like the idea of money sitting idle, right in their head.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.480]   They feel like there's this return that money should have.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.440]   And so one of the things we designed into Daffy from the get go was the ability that
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.240]   when you open your account, you can pick from one of nine portfolios to invest your money
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   in.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.360]   We have standard ETF portfolios, low cost, all Vanguard ETFs, only four basis points
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.620]   for the entire portfolio.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.440]   We have ESG portfolios, which are mostly BlackRock products.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.720]   They're slightly more expensive, but for many people, they want to align their investing
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.760]   with their giving and their values.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.840]   And then, of course, we have, because it's 2022, we have pure crypto portfolios.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.560]   Coinbase is one of our investors.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.440]   And so if you want to put your money into a diversified portfolio that includes crypto
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.960]   or even a pure crypto portfolio of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we do that for people.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.400]   And that's been really popular.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.560]   It turns out that that's a very hard feature to get.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.320]   Most donor advised funds out there do not have crypto options, either for contribution
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   or for investing.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.520]   A lot of the transfers we've been receiving for donor advised funds, existing ones, are
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.360]   because we actually have crypto as an option.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.200]   I just want to thank you, Quik, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.960]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.580]   I also want to jump into the course you teach.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.580]   So I looked up...
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:16.640]   You wrote a blog post and you shared some of the ratings and it seemed like everyone
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   loved your class.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:22.560]   There was like seven questions and no one said this was not well or extremely poor.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   And I'll send a link.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.360]   You actually publish all the slides for the class, which is Personal Finance for Engineers.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.540]   I'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.920]   People can check it out.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.760]   But outside of philanthropy, outside of giving, what do you think people are getting wrong
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.320]   about personal finance?
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.640]   What I always see repeatedly is people looking for this secret to get wealthy.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   It's this one trick.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.880]   I'm old enough to remember the infomercial age, you know, late night, the guy on the
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.240]   boat telling you like you could be rich tomorrow and do whatever.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.760]   But I know it sounds silly, but I feel like it's an evergreen market.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.480]   Like I see every cycle, people looking for this kind of get rich quick.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.560]   It could be get rich quick with crypto.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.160]   It could be with real estate.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.560]   All these different options, the right type of account, the right type of insurance, etc.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.560]   And I think the biggest mistake that people make is not realizing that the most likely
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:14.640]   path to success is to focus on your career, which by the way, has a high tie to your income,
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   right?
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   The top line is actually a big deal.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.680]   For many people, it's easier for them to figure out how to make an extra $10,000 than it actually
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.200]   is for them to figure out how to save $10,000.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.440]   It's one of these funny things about society.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.400]   Focus on your income, your skills, your career, that top line.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.880]   Spend less than you make, right?
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.400]   And by the way, to your point earlier about increasing things over time, increasing your
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.380]   savings rate over time, right?
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.520]   How many people actually save 10% of their income because they live off their salary
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.200]   and they don't spend the bonus, right?
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:50.900]   Like that's a very easy way in some ways to just not build up a lifestyle that assumes
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.880]   you're making that money.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.820]   And so I think that a lot of people get the basics wrong.
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.920]   They want to jump to these special things and they focus so much on things that if you
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.200]   actually do the financial work, will earn them basis points, right?
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.360]   One hundredth of a percent, 10 basis points, half a percent, 1%.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.380]   And I'm not going to pretend that doesn't matter.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:13.360]   You compound an extra percent over 30 years, it's a lot of money, but it's not as big as
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.160]   just focusing on the basics.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.760]   And then by the way, this gets even worse with couples and with households, right?
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.220]   Like the amount of dysfunction with the way spouses treat money or the way people fail
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:28.440]   to plan together or even talk about money with each other probably has a lot more to
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:33.720]   do with financial problems people have than the fact that they didn't buy Tesla stock
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.240]   five years ago.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.040]   I think that tracks with some past conversations we've had.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:44.280]   But one thing that keeps coming up, and I noticed it was interesting, your final course
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.840]   seems to be a grab bag of what do people want to talk about?
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.840]   That's right.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.680]   And it's probably no surprise to anyone listening that, you know, it's like, let's talk about
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.320]   venture capital and crypto.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.360]   And, you know, I even saw a slide that talked about NFTs.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.880]   Where do you think some of the more exciting things fit into place?
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.800]   And I'll use you as an example, obviously, you know, you've been fortunate with some
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.440]   of your career choices and the companies you've worked at.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.640]   But eventually, you got to a point that you're doing lots of angel investing.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.620]   How do some of these alternative investments fit in?
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:21.240]   And not necessarily to the path to wealth, if you will, but to your investment portfolio?
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:25.600]   You know, you've thought a lot about investing at Wealthfront, also at Davi for your own
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   life.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.920]   How do you think things like investing in startups fits in?
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.560]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.360]   And I don't want to pretend that I think that those things are irrational or not worth doing.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.640]   If you do the math, and you think about the system, a lot of these investments can make
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.840]   sense in some situations, right?
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:46.600]   The idea of having a small percentage of your portfolio in private equity isn't outlandish,
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   right?
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.320]   Like, you know, some of the best money managers in the world who run endowments, etc, allocate
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.360]   money to private equity and venture capital, for good reason.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.160]   Same thing is happening, by the way, with alternative asset classes, right?
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.560]   You know, it's been more than 10 years, but the data is coming in.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:05.600]   And I have to be honest, from my point of view, it seems like this argument on crypto,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.320]   which you saw on the slides, that says no, digital assets seem to be a different asset
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:15.860]   class, they behave differently, they have different basis, they are not completely correlated
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.200]   with other asset classes.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.800]   And as a result, they might be an interesting addition to a diversified portfolio is a very
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.120]   rational question to ask.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.200]   And actually, I cover a lot of this in my class, I don't have a problem with these assets.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.600]   Like I said, the problem is less that people stay away from these things irrationally.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   It's usually the opposite.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.920]   They, you know, I got a question asked on Twitter just the other day, where, you know,
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.480]   I was talking about crypto, Acorns actually added crypto as an option to their portfolio,
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.340]   similar to the way that Wealthfront did.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.840]   And the question came in, well, if crypto is so good, why don't you put all your money
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   into it?
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.760]   And it's like, whoa, like, that's, that's actually never the answer.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.120]   Education turns out to be a pretty good deal from most perspectives.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.640]   But I do like the education to it.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.800]   So each of these topics are different.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.920]   It's a Stanford class, right?
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:05.120]   So not talking about venture capital and private equity at a Stanford class, Stanford, I mean,
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.240]   it would just read wrong.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.800]   So it's not surprising that students always want to know many of them are going to end
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.880]   up going to work for startups or venture backed startups, etc.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.480]   Some of them will go into venture capital.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.900]   Crypto is one of these interesting overlaps where I mean, I will tell you, as someone
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:21.900]   who came out of school as an engineer, you know, computer science, etc.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.160]   I've run into digital assets many times in my career.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.920]   My first startup that I joined is like the fifth engineer was on digital software distribution,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:34.840]   encryption and how do you do this and this hard problem of what do you do with the fact
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.840]   that software can be perfectly copied for free is actually something that was endemic
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.080]   to the entire industry last 50 years, like how can you make money on software?
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.680]   If people can make a perfect copy for free, right?
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.560]   This has affected music and all forms of media.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.640]   And even at eBay, I remember doing a strategy once on what eBay's digital assets strategy
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.100]   should be, digital goods strategy.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.040]   And at the time, it was not solvable, because if you didn't have a central authority, like
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   what Apple did for iTunes, you couldn't build that platform.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.700]   So for me, crypto is a very exciting technology area.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:09.080]   There's a lot of interesting work being done, the energy is phenomenal.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.040]   But from a financial point of view, the simple argument is like, let's, let's go to first
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.040]   principles, right?
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:18.240]   Like, do you think digital assets are a thing that have unique value?
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.320]   Is it a different thing?
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.440]   Does it have value?
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.540]   And will it have value long term?
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:26.060]   And then what are the characteristics of that type of investment?
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.680]   To me, those are actually perfectly appropriate for a class.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.040]   And I think a lot of the students enjoyed going through it.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.120]   I was actually surprised crypto was not as popular a topic in any of the previous years
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   as I would have expected.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.260]   I expected every student to vote for it.
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:43.400]   It turns out the most popular topic with students that they asked for in the beginning continues
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.400]   to be real estate.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.720]   I don't know what branding or marketing is going on that's pushing real estate.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.900]   But maybe it's just that you're in Silicon Valley, it's one of those areas where no one
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.640]   can figure out how you could ever buy a house.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.040]   And so, you know, real estate is just one of those options.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.760]   But I actually dedicated a whole class to real estate, because there were so many requests
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   for it.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:06.480]   Yeah, there was a slide you had that was interesting, because I feel like every time I talk to people,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.240]   there's people who are like, the path to wealth is to own rental properties, and then there's
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.440]   everyone else.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.920]   And that cohort of people believe that that is the best investment class.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.560]   Yeah, that's an area that I flipped around on.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:22.120]   If you had talked to me 10 years ago, I probably mostly would have said there's some really
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:27.200]   unhealthy marketing push that's across society and the industry that keeps pushing people
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:33.160]   towards rental real estate as somehow the best path to financial freedom.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.480]   That being said, I mean, the Federal Reserve, there was a paper that came out at the end
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:43.240]   of 2017, I shared in my class, etc. that kind of exposed the fact that most of the data
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:48.200]   that historically been aggregated about real estate did not include rental income, right?
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.920]   So most of the data you saw about real estate as an asset class covered the idea of the
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.880]   capital gains from it and not the income from it.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.520]   And so they did a very good job of looking across 20 different cities in the Europe and
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.360]   the US over 100 years, all different timespans, etc.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.900]   And it turns out there's actually a pretty fair argument that says that rental properties
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.380]   are actually a very interesting asset class.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.360]   They have lower volatility than stocks.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.600]   They don't quite have equity like returns.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.360]   But when you do that sharp ratio, right, when you look at the risk adjusted return, rental
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.760]   properties are better than I think the industry gave them credit for.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.900]   And I'm just saying this as, you know, a personal story of what we cover in the class.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.080]   But I'm not totally surprised it has the draw anymore.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.680]   I mean, the truth is, a lot of people want control over their financial lives.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.320]   Yeah, look, I'm a founder, right?
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   You've been a founder.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.600]   I think there's a natural instinct from a lot of people, a dream of running their own
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.880]   business.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.520]   And in many ways, owning rental properties sounds like a financial investment, but really
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.560]   it's running a business, right?
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.440]   And I think there are a lot of people who like running a business and they like the
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.280]   idea of learning how that business makes money.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.580]   And they like learning how to be successful at it.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:01.200]   And so it is an investment, but it's also an occupation in a way.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.960]   It's a lifestyle.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.260]   As much as owning a restaurant would be, or for you and me, it might be a venture-backed
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.380]   software company.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.500]   But I think that I've grown to accept the fact that the reason it's so attractive is
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.540]   because people don't look at it purely as an investment option.
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:16.660]   They look at it also as a better way to live.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   Now, I think where people go astray is, you actually even mentioned this, I think, briefly.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:26.660]   Considering rental property is some form of passive income, I think it's too idealistic.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.620]   It's a job, right?
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.620]   No matter how much you invest in property management or whatever, this idea that somehow
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:36.920]   you're going to be sitting on the beach somewhere and collecting checks does not match the reality
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.780]   that most people who get into rental properties have to think about.
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.740]   I think the questions are reasonable.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:44.460]   And especially, I think, by the way, I don't think those questions are going away.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:47.460]   Looking at what's going on with real estate prices, not just in California or the Bay
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:53.020]   Area, but nationwide, I mean, everyone got a crash course in real estate in the last
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.020]   20 years.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.540]   You had the incredible boom in the 2000s.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.460]   You had the incredible blowup in 2008, 2009.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:03.780]   And now we're seeing real estate across the country surge again.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780]   And now guess what?
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   Inflation's back.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   So everyone has that topic.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.400]   And something that seemed like one of those stories that your parents and grandparents
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.720]   told you, at least in the US, historically, seeing that come back has people looking at
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.780]   real assets again.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.700]   So I think for better or worse, you're going to see a lot of interest in real estate.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.500]   Probably too much, given the realities of it as an asset class, but it is reasonable
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500]   that people are interested.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.340]   But like I said, most lawyers are not going to find financial success by investing in
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340]   rental properties.
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.840]   They're going to find financial success by being great lawyers and actually spending
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.420]   less than they make and investing that capital prudently.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.060]   That's just something that I see in the data.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.540]   It's something that I believe, and it's what I teach in the class.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:49.300]   I asked Morgan Housel for his best hack, and it was like, "Spend less than you earn and
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.300]   wait."
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.580]   Well, Warren Buffett may not be perfect, but I will tell you, sometimes he has just the
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.140]   right quotes.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.640]   I forget which talk show host it was, that question of like, "You're very upfront with
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   what you do.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.420]   Why don't more people invest the way you do?"
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:11.220]   And he says, "Well, I found in my life that very few people want to get rich slowly."
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.220]   And it's just true.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:17.660]   And by the way, you look at his results, most of his money, over 90% of it was made after
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:18.700]   he was 70.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.060]   I think some incredible amount of it was made in the last 10 years.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.500]   That's how compounding works.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.780]   Everyone has an urgency to it, and I understand why.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.780]   When you're young, you're young.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.940]   You want money now.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.180]   You want success now.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.920]   You want to build your life now.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.060]   So I think that tension is always going to be there.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.460]   And so that's why I'm so bullish on software and systems.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:43.460]   I think that humans are never going to get their emotions out of the way when it comes
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.460]   to money.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.300]   As much as you can tell people that this is the way they should reinvest their dividends
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.220]   and this is what they should watch in their expenses, and this is how taxes work.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220]   We're busy.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.860]   We have other priorities.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.220]   Even if we were fully rational, we probably wouldn't get around to doing it.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.860]   And the fact is, we're not fully rational.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.620]   And so this is why I like apps and services.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.100]   I like what Wealthfront did for financial advice and for investing.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.820]   I like what Acorns does for saving, getting millions of people have some money at the
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.660]   end of the month that they wouldn't have.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.540]   And I'm hoping that's what Daffy ends up helping to do with giving.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:18.580]   It's systems that make it easier for people to do the right thing with their money.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:23.980]   I want to jump last to the quick few questions outside of finance, outside of giving.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.140]   I always like to ask people, if someone's coming to your neck of the woods, where would
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.300]   you tell them to go for dinner, grab a drink and something to do?
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.580]   The number one challenge I usually have when people come in to visit is they are always
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.300]   focused on San Francisco, but I grew up in Silicon Valley.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.100]   When it comes to places, I mean, it depends.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.060]   There's a little place in Los Altos called The Post, which I like to take people for
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.060]   lunch.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.820]   Like if they're meeting for lunch, I found that they have a broad enough menu and it's
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:53.300]   nice enough that no matter where you're from, no matter what diet you're on, no matter what
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.140]   you're avoiding or doing or what, like there's something for everyone.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.100]   And so it tends to work when I have people from out of town.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.360]   Of course, if you're meeting me for coffee, I'm super boring.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.980]   It's always going to be at the Starbucks in Los Altos.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.420]   But for dinner, I mean, I like steakhouses.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.980]   I mean, I'm a huge fan of Alexander's Steakhouse.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980]   There's several of them.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.980]   One in San Francisco.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.060]   Of course, there's actually one in Palo Alto called The Sea, and there's one down in Cupertino.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.980]   The Cupertino one's the original one.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.940]   But if you're looking for a really high quality steak with kind of a more Japanese elements
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.460]   to it, it's really hard to beat in my book.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   That's fantastic.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.980]   Any, any, any suggestion to spend a weekend or an afternoon doing something outside of
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.860]   San Francisco in the Bay Area?
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.060]   Oh, I'm always a big fan of getting outdoors.
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.700]   I like taking people, walking them around Stanford.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.860]   Stanford's still a beautiful place that I think actually captures a lot of both California
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.260]   and kind of the environment.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.500]   It's almost always warm and full of life.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.780]   But I like getting outside, actually, like, you know, hiking the Dish, walking shorelines
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780]   beautiful.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.980]   There's so many parks around that you can actually go to.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.420]   But I'm also going to preface this with a I'm super boring.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.660]   Like there's a reason why most people don't plan their vacations around me.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.980]   No, I think these are some good tips.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.660]   I really appreciate it.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.580]   Before we head out, where can people find the stuff you're working on, the stuff you're
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580]   writing online?
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.940]   Oh, for sure.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:19.220]   So the best place to go, of course, for Daffy, of course, is go to Daffy.org.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.420]   All the content is there a lot to read up on the articles that I've written are on the
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:23.460]   Daffy blog.
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.100]   We have some evergreen resources there.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.180]   So if you're interested in philanthropy or giving or anything, I talked about the generosity,
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.100]   the tax savings on donating stock or crypto, you can find that all in the Daffy blog.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:37.020]   I do blog personally still, although it turns out building a startup takes time and so not
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.380]   as much as I used to.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.660]   But yeah, my blog has been running Adam Nash blog has most of the information I've published
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.860]   the last 15 years.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.100]   And then, of course, if you're interested in that Stanford class, it's really meaningful
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.180]   for me to push financial education out as broadly as possible.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.940]   One of the reasons to do the Stanford class was to make it more normalized that there
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.460]   would be personal finance education.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.460]   And so if you're interested in any of those decks that Chris went through, if you actually
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:07.140]   go to CS007.blog, all the slides for all the last five years are there.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.780]   Yeah, I'll link to all that in the show notes.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.820]   And we said it before.
