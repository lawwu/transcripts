[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.000]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.760]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited you're here today.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.160]   It's a bit crazy to think that I'm already at episode 50.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.800]   For those of you who've been with me on the journey, thank you so much for
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.360]   listening.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.120]   And for those of you who are new today, looking to upgrade your own life,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.680]   definitely don't miss out on the previous 49 episodes.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.480]   They cover everything from travel hacking, maximizing your credit card
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.360]   points, honing your negotiation skills, mastering your charisma, optimizing your
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.080]   health, and so much more.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   I am certain that if you scroll through the archives, there will be an episode
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.520]   that speaks to you and improves your life meaningfully.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.720]   And in today's episode, we're not only going to talk about improving our own
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.160]   lives, but improving the lives of others.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.680]   Because I'm joined by my good friend, Adam Nash, and we're going to be talking
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.560]   about giving and philanthropy.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.440]   Adam is a seasoned executive, investor, and advisor.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.600]   He sits on the board at the investing company, Acorns.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.240]   He teaches a personal finance for engineers course at Stanford, and he was
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.320]   previously the president and CEO at Wealthfront, though it was before my time
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.640]   there.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.560]   But most relevant to our conversation today, he is currently the co-founder and
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.360]   CEO of Daffy, a not-for-profit community built around a new and modern way to
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   give.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   It is a fantastic product that I love, and I'm not an advisor or investor in the
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.560]   company.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.960]   I am just a fan.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.000]   In our conversation, we're going to talk about all aspects of philanthropy, how
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.560]   much people give, the friction in giving, how to pick and vet charitable
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.440]   organizations, the tax benefits of being charitable, and ways to maximize those
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.160]   benefits.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.920]   There is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.240]   Well, after I remind you that Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.040]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.720]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.680]   investment decisions.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.320]   Adam, thank you so much for being here.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.880]   Chris, great to be here.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000]   Excited to talk about all of these topics.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.840]   Awesome.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.400]   So I just want to kick us off.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.080]   What do you think is one of the biggest misconceptions people have today when it
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.960]   comes to philanthropy?
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.840]   You know, there's a lot of things about philanthropy that people don't know, but
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.600]   the most common misperception in my book is that people think it's something just
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.520]   for billionaires.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.840]   They get so obsessed with what billionaires are doing with their money and how much
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.400]   they're giving.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.280]   It makes the news.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.200]   It's in your feed.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.320]   You don't realize that actually the research shows that almost everyone gives.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.480]   Almost everyone was raised to believe that to be a good person, you remember that no
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.160]   matter what's going on in your life, there are people out there less fortunate than
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.480]   yourself, right?
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.520]   And that everyone can make a difference.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   And the data backs it up, right?
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.680]   In the U.S., somewhere between 60 to 70 million households every year give
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   proportionally.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.520]   People with less money actually give a higher percentage of their income and wealth
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   than wealthier people.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.280]   But the conversation tends to be dominated by a few billionaires when really, from my
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.560]   point of view, what's helpful for people is understanding what you can do and what
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.880]   you should do and what makes you feel good to do.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.280]   And so that's probably the biggest misperception I see out there when I talk
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.880]   about giving.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.840]   One of my favorite stats, I guess it's not a stat, but a piece of research on giving
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.360]   was from a book called Happy Money.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.880]   And if you haven't read it, they try to break down like things you can use your
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.760]   money for to be happy and giving is one of them and helping others.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080]   Is there any kind of framework that's generic enough to apply to anyone about how
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.840]   to think about giving or how much to give?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.520]   I don't know if there's one answer, but it's funny, I actually just wrote a post
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   about this a few weeks ago about my own personal experience, which I actually have
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.800]   found that is shared with a number of people.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   It was about 10, 11 years ago that LinkedIn went public and I was the head of product
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.360]   there for a number of years.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.160]   So that was actually my first exposure to a donor advised fund, like an account
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   dedicated for charity.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.720]   And the minute you have to open one of these accounts, you face this question that you
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.480]   don't know, which is like, well, how much do I put in there?
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.280]   How much do I give to charity?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.560]   And it sounds like such a simple question.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.840]   My accountant said it was simple, right?
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.120]   You know, you've had a big year.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.240]   LinkedIn's going public.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.440]   Think about how much you give to charity every year and multiply it by 10.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   And that's a good place to start for funding your account.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.640]   But that didn't make it any easier because I don't know how much I gave to charity
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.920]   every year. I could look at my Quicken.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.760]   I'm like one of these old time people, like I have a Quicken file that goes back to
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.840]   1994, so I actually can go back and look at these things and what my spending is.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.000]   But it actually was a great moment for me and my wife to actually talk about what we
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.200]   wanted to give and how we thought about it.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.120]   The biggest thing I advocate for people and recommend is just to have a goal, just
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.400]   have a number, right?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.920]   Like we have goals for all sorts of things.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.880]   You and I both know, right, like saving for retirement, saving for college, saving for
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.640]   a house. There's two things that you do to make that one is you actually figure out
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.560]   what your goal is. And second, you automate it.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.000]   Right. And giving can be the same way.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.280]   And so that question of how much you should give actually was amazing.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.880]   Doing user research for Daffy, I had the chance to ask dozens and dozens of people what
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.120]   they think they should give to charity every year.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.760]   And the amazing thing is that almost no one agrees.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.160]   Like some people use percentages, some people use numbers, big numbers, small numbers.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.000]   For some people, it's about where they are in life and if they can afford to do it.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.760]   But the thing that was universal is that actually almost everyone does have an opinion
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.880]   about it. And almost everyone I talked to thought it should be something, not nothing.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.440]   OK. And so I try not to be prescriptive to people on how much they should give as much
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.240]   as asking them how much they think they should give every year and actually spend a
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.920]   little bit of time setting that goal.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.720]   And then, of course, we all know great ways to stick to goals once we set them.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.640]   Yeah, automation is great.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.440]   Are there benchmarks even for people who are not sure what's even normal?
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.640]   You know, the data actually exists, right?
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.160]   So the IRS publishes data every year based on zip code and a number of different factors
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.480]   about how much giving happens.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.640]   There are also private institutions.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.120]   I'm actually an investor in one private company called Zest is This for Nonprofits, etc.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.680]   So the data is out there, but almost no one accesses it.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.240]   It's not easy to come by.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.160]   In fact, one of the features we put into our initial release is that it's a mobile app,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.640]   right? So based on the zip code, the city or state you're in, we tell you what the median
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.240]   household in your city gives to charity every year.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.480]   OK, but it's a very natural question.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.280]   I think most of us want to be good people.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.760]   We want to do the right thing.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.920]   I actually think one of the problems in philanthropy is that there isn't enough information
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.760]   available to people, right?
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.440]   Like, think about how many calculators there are out there that help people figure out
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.400]   how much they should save for retirement or save for college or how much they need to
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.640]   do to buy a house.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.360]   There's probably too many of those calculators out there, too many articles.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.120]   But when it comes to giving, it's all amorphous.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.200]   The only data you see published tends to be about the largest gifts.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.640]   I mean, maybe if you go to university, right, like and you get the alumni booklet, you can
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.920]   see the tiers of who's giving and how much.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   But we really don't have a lot of information about it.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.720]   I think it makes us all a little uncomfortable and we feel a little guilty, I think, because
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.080]   we don't know if we're doing enough or doing the right amount.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.280]   And I think that most of us want to do the right thing.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.760]   Well, it sounds like the the best part is if you're just doing it, that's great.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.360]   And similar to saving, when I give people advice for saving, I say, well, first off,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   just start saving.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.360]   And then if you're not sure what to do, start small.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   And if it feels like you could do more, increase your savings rate.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.320]   And I assume you could just apply a similar metric there.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.520]   I don't know how much I can afford to give, but I know I could give a hundred dollars
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.760]   a month. It's like, great, do that at the end of the year or at the end of six months.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   Does that feel low? Maybe try to increase the number if it does.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.800]   If it feels like too much, you can dial it back.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   But just starting somewhere and tracking it might give you some place to kind of compare
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.080]   and contrast what changes you'd make in the future.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.760]   Yeah, I can't agree more.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.360]   This is one of the things I love about this space is I think we've learned a lot in the
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.760]   last 10 or 20 years about how to help people save, how to help people invest, how to help
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320]   people hit their financial goals.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.840]   I'm really excited about this idea of applying all those lessons to philanthropy, to
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.480]   giving. And most of those lessons apply.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.840]   So, yeah, just get started, right?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.480]   Like, how should I get started saving for retirement?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.400]   The first thing to do is actually to start saving for retirement.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.920]   And the rest comes pretty naturally.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.880]   And I think with giving, it's even better than saving or investing in a number of ways.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.200]   I mean, I love saving and investing.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.880]   Let's be clear. I do.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.480]   But when you give money and you feel that your money went somewhere, had real impact
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.880]   on real people, on something you care about, it's a different kind of reward.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.800]   And so I actually agree with your advice.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.600]   I think that you get started giving to cause to an organization you care about, right?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.480]   Not just a checkbox on a window, something that you actually meaningfully care about.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.440]   And no matter how much the amount is, it can be just a few dollars.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.840]   In general, when you do it, it's a good experience and most people want to do it again.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.360]   And so, yeah, getting started.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.160]   Well, that's that's the right place to start.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.400]   I remember I had given to a charity water birthday thing, which was all the rage, maybe
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.760]   five, 10 years ago.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.280]   And then they tracked you and said, hey, here's that well that your money a year or two
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.880]   ago contribute to opening.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.840]   And I remember, oh, wow, that felt really good.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.400]   And that level of kind of follow through from the organization was really cool.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.040]   One of the questions I think a lot of people have is how do you even decide whether an
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.880]   organization you might want to give to is a responsible one, is going to follow through
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.600]   and use the money wisely?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.520]   I know there's some sites with ratings, but is that the best way to do it?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.040]   Is there a way you recommend people do diligence if they're thinking about where to give?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.440]   Well, I think this is another problem that people have and talk about is while everyone
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.680]   wants to give, everyone has a little bit of an anxiety of, well, how do I know that this
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.720]   organization is legitimate?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   How do I know if this organization is good?
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.880]   And then, of course, is it where my money will be best spent?
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.680]   There are a lot of sites and there's a lot of information available.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.080]   Once again, the IRS does publish a list of all the valid registered charities for the
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   most part in the US.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.240]   But this gets back to us a problem we have in the US in general, which is that we're
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.480]   not comfortable talking about money with each other.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   We don't talk about giving as well.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.160]   I mean, the reason those birthday campaigns are so effective on Facebook and work is because
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.520]   actually it turns out it's not just social proof.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.560]   It's that if you know the person and they think that that charity is a good one, well,
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.240]   you've outsourced a little bit of that validation, right?
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.880]   Their reputation, your relationship, you decide to say, well, this is clearly a good enough
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.320]   organization for them and it's meaningful to them and I will support them.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.560]   And it also feels good to give.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.680]   And so I do think that that is part of the process.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.080]   I think people should be less afraid to ask each other what organizations and causes they
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   support.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.840]   I think people should be less afraid to share the organizations that they personally support
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   and why.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.560]   I mean, last year in the fall on Twitter, I did campaigns for different events where
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.280]   I talked about some of the charities that I support.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.000]   I even did matching campaigns where I said, you know, hey, everyone for this month, if
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.540]   you give to this charity, like I'll match it type of thing, which you've probably seen
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.100]   on Twitter from a lot of celebrities and other folks.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.440]   And I think there's a lot of value to that and elevating these charities.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.720]   If you talk to the folks who run these charities, they're desperate for people to talk more
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   about what they do.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.920]   Like there's no amount of marketing they can do that really has the same impact of actual
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.520]   validation and endorsement from people who believe in that charity, believe in that cause.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.920]   But yes, for people who want to look at the data, there are a number of sites that do
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.560]   good jobs of ratings and percentages.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.340]   We built them into Daffy, for example, but there's a number of other sites that do this
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.000]   charity Navigator and other ones.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.340]   And I think it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.180]   I'd also encourage people to consider giving locally, right?
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:30.900]   Some great organizations are within a mile of where you live, of where you work.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.920]   And it's not that hard to find local organizations and certainly not that hard to check them
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.980]   out and validate them.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.220]   But many people tend to just stick to the big names that they've heard of, right?
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.300]   Because they think that they're safer, right?
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.900]   Like they've heard of this organization that's been around for decades.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.180]   Once again, this gets back to whatever gives you comfort giving probably is a good thing.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:58.360]   The odds of you giving money to a bad organization are much, much lower than the odds of you
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.080]   just not getting over the hump to give at all.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.420]   And remember, that is the point.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.900]   The point is to get resources to people and to causes that you believe in.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.300]   - We talked briefly about how to pick a number, but do you believe people could be giving
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   more?
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   - It depends how you look at it.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   I mean, the US is known in philanthropy circles as a very generous nation.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.260]   And that's because if you look at the percent of our economy that we actually give, it's
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260]   very high.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.020]   So in 2020, it was $471 billion in the US.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.500]   That roughly worked out to be about 2.3% of GDP.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.500]   That's a big number.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.380]   I mean, all of agriculture is less than 1% of GDP in the US.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.940]   So that's a very big number.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.820]   And so you could ask the question, like, why do other countries give less or give more?
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.940]   Is it about economics, does it tie to economic inequality?
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.940]   There's all sorts of reasons.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.540]   Is it because of religion, right?
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.580]   The most common donations that people make tend to be to religious and academic institutions.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.400]   But I think overall, Americans are generous.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.580]   But when you ask the question, could we be more generous?
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.100]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.100]   There's no question.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.740]   You know, one of the things that I was surprised to find out was that there's very good research.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.780]   You mentioned behavioral finance earlier and like automating things, etc.
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:14.620]   But there's actually very good research that suggests that the amount that we want to give
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:19.300]   as individuals is quite a bit higher than what we actually give.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.860]   And actually, I validated this myself, just in user research, etc.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.140]   If you ask someone how much they think they should give every year, they give you a number.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.980]   You ask them how much they actually gave last year, you get a little bit of a pause, a little
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.220]   bit of guilt, because the truth is, we have busy lives, right?
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.900]   We don't get around to it.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:45.260]   And so it turns out this research says that we would give about 32% more if we actually
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:51.500]   just gave the amount that we think we should, like not even stretching ourselves, not pushing
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.140]   us to give more than we think we should.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.360]   Just if you're the type of person who thinks you should give a few hundred dollars to charity
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.740]   every year, or a few thousand dollars, or whatever your number is, it turns out for
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.680]   the most part, we don't stick to it.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.300]   And I know you know this, but it's pretty obvious why.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.460]   It's the exact same reason.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.900]   How much would we save for retirement, if you had to write a check or manually make
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.900]   the transaction?
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.060]   We all know that it's like, no, no, no, have the 401k come out of your paycheck, right?
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.000]   That actually helps people stick to a plan.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.020]   And it hasn't been applied to giving.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.340]   But yeah, definitely we could all give more, even though we do give a lot.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:29.600]   And like I said, if you look at it, that $471 billion, over $330 billion of that is from
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.500]   individuals, right?
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.460]   These aren't foundations and corporations giving all sorts of money.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.460]   I mean, they are.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.340]   I mean, more than $100 billion a year.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.380]   But individuals are generous.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.900]   I think they would be more generous, though, if they came up with a system for giving.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.500]   Are there other hurdles or barriers other than just the hassle of following through?
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.060]   Is it finding the right places?
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.180]   Or what do you think else holds people back?
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.180]   So you bring up a good question.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.340]   You actually brought up some of the issues earlier, which I agree with.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.860]   I'm a product person at heart.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.220]   So I think of product problems.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.000]   And when I looked at giving, it was very clear to me that at minimum, giving is two very
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.820]   hard problems for people.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.180]   There's the how much can I afford to give, right?
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.180]   Which is a hard problem.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.500]   I guess that's tied a little bit to how much you should give.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.580]   But people are not very good at budgeting.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.740]   They're not very good at allocating numbers, not even very good at understanding what their
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.020]   income is or their expenses are.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.180]   So there's this hard problem of how much to give.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.860]   And there's a second set of hard problems around who to give it to.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.580]   And this is actually one of the reasons I actually really love the idea of separating
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.100]   those two problems.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.300]   So to our earlier conversation, I think the best thing you can do for that first problem
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.500]   is just set a goal and put money aside for charity, just like you put money aside for
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.940]   a number of other things.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.660]   Have it somewhere separate so that when people ask you to give or when you find an organization
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.700]   or cause you believe in, you're not struggling with that first question of how much you can
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.700]   afford.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.940]   You already have it set aside.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.720]   It's there for you.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.740]   That second question, though, of who to give it to, I don't think there's any shortcut
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.740]   there.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.820]   I think social information can help, knowing who your friends and colleagues give to.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.340]   I think research can help.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.340]   But I think the truth is most people build those relationships over time.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.220]   And that's actually very good for nonprofits, because the truth is they don't want a donation
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.380]   from you just once.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.980]   Most of these organizations have budgets they have to run every year.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.300]   So what they really want from someone who supports them is someone who's going to support
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.580]   them regularly.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.420]   They would probably much rather get money from you, a smaller amount, regularly every
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:41.420]   year than a one-time birthday raise where they never see that money again.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.300]   It's the reason that nonprofits actually spend a lot of money and time fundraising.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.820]   It's a very heavy sales process for them, because it's very transactional.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.660]   They always have to convince someone to reach in their wallet, pull out some money, give
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.780]   it to them.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.540]   It's a very hard process to get through.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.060]   So I tend to recommend people that not feel the pressure to give all the money away at
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.820]   once as much as build these relationships, find organizations that you support, be comfortable
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.620]   supporting them, give them your regular support.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.500]   And over time, you'll add more and more organizations.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.700]   One thing I learned when I was going through this process myself of just evaluating some
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:20.540]   organizations is there is a lot of information about every organization.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.260]   Not only do they have to file, I'm going to maybe get it wrong, is it a 990?
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.260]   Is that the right number?
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.260]   That's right.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.260]   With the IRS.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.820]   So there's a document that's here's who we are.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   Here's how much we spend.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.820]   Here's our expenses.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.300]   Here's how much we pay our directors.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:38.220]   But almost all of them also have annual reports summarizing the impact they had.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.300]   So if there's an organization, I would say there might be charity scams.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.900]   I'm sure there are, but there is a lot of validating places like IRS websites, validating
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.220]   the tax ID numbers to make sure that you're giving to somewhere good.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.580]   And there's just a lot of content about who and what is happening within an organization.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.020]   So as much as someone might say, like, I don't know about this organization, I feel like
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.580]   it's if you're thinking that in your head, I feel like it's not a great excuse because
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.500]   there is information out there.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.260]   And with the advent of the Internet, it's never been easier to find it.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.260]   I agree with you.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.300]   I think it's not hard to get to conviction about different organizations, given how much
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.980]   content is out there.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.860]   That being said, I understand the anxiety.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.420]   It's the same thing that happens with sensationalism in every industry, right?
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.180]   You only read the worst stories.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.780]   And there have been stories over the decades of nonprofits where directors embezzled money
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.340]   or self-enriched themselves in private planes and that sort of thing.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.420]   So that anxiety, I think, is real.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.060]   But to your point, it's not hard to validate local charities if you're really interested.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.540]   It is not hard to ask around of what charities other people support.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.220]   And certainly for the national charities, it is not hard to find ample information about
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.220]   them.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.620]   And so I think it's a solvable problem.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.620]   I don't want to pretend it's not a problem.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.900]   I think it's reasonable for people to have questions of where they're sending money.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.260]   I mean, it's very funny.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.020]   The amount of research people want to do to send $100 donation somehow is a lot higher
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:08.780]   than the amount of research they do before grabbing that random ad on Instagram for $100.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.200]   This is actually one of the opportunities, I think, in the industry is there's no real
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.780]   reason it has to be that way.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.060]   For some reason, we've convinced people that buying that random item on Instagram, that
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.980]   they can just do that with tap, tap, tap.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.420]   We should make giving that easy.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.980]   There are reasons why you can't trust a random company on the internet.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.800]   One of my first jobs on the internet was at eBay.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.340]   And believe it or not, there was a time where it seemed crazy that you would buy something
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.460]   from a stranger that you'd never met and you would send them money and just you'd assume
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.780]   that the item would be good and not broken, like as represented.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:46.080]   We take it for granted now, but that seemed ludicrous 20, 30 years ago.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.420]   I think that some of that friction we got rid of, right?
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.540]   Like people now trust, for the most part, e-commerce.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.980]   Now, sometimes bad things happen.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   There's no question.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.140]   I've made a purchase or two online that turned out to be a mistake.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.180]   But I think there's no reason why we can't use the same techniques to give people confidence
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.000]   that hey, if you want to send a gift for a cause or to an organization, we've already
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.020]   filtered them, it's going to be fine.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.940]   Like it's going to be a very rare situation where something goes wrong.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.580]   And in the most common case, you will have helped real people with something that matters.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:24.700]   One tactic I had, so in the past month, there's been a lot of giving support for Ukraine.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:30.040]   And I was thinking, gosh, I had never done any research about nonprofits that support
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   Ukraine.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.580]   That was just not something that last year or any previous year had come across my radar.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.900]   And one option was, okay, well, let's spend a lot of time to figure this out.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.700]   And what I ended up doing was through both, I think, some of your posts, other people's
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.460]   posts, I came up with a list of 10 organizations, I took how much I wanted to get, I divided
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.460]   by 10.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.760]   And I was like, "Look, if one of these organizations isn't as great as the other, well, I gave
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   to all 10.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   So it's okay."
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.340]   I played the diversification game.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.700]   I crowdsourced the information from friends, from people online, from articles, and gave
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.020]   to all of them.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.820]   And I know that probably doesn't bode well for the recurring ongoing relationship.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.380]   But if you're out there thinking, "Gosh, I want to give to this cause, and I'm not sure
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.740]   how," and you don't want to do the research, maybe pick five organizations that do it.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.780]   And the risk that one is bad is now one-fifth as much.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:27.700]   But I would guess if you look at the numbers, the risk is already very, very small.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   The risk is small.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.340]   And more importantly, I think we have a situation like Ukraine, more important for the bias
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.980]   just to be to help, to give, to do something rather than nothing.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.180]   And so your process sounds good.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:44.260]   I mean, we did a Daffy tweet out a list of nonprofits that we thought were well-researched
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.120]   and advocated by other institutions.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.620]   This is one of these areas that on the one hand, I say, "Listen, yeah, the most important
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.940]   thing is you find institutions."
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.980]   I actually like the idea of portfolios or several institutions in an area.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.880]   I think that there's something very interesting there for people, I think, about not picking
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.660]   one organization to give to that actually might make it easier to give.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.380]   But at the same time, it's still too hard.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.860]   We're not all experts.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.420]   But I think what you did sounds like the right thing to do.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.620]   They're reputable sources, crowdsource a list, come up with the amount you want to give.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.000]   And whether you split it across different organizations or give it to one, the point
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.540]   is you've actually helped.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.940]   And we can debate how much, but you've helped.
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.940]   And it made it easier.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.940]   It was funny.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.940]   I'd find another one.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.780]   I decided an amount and split it amongst 10, and then an 11th popped up.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.100]   And I was like, "Wow, I can't not give to the 11th.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.420]   This one looks good too."
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.900]   So then I ended up giving 10% more to that 11th one than I'd originally planned, and
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.900]   it felt great.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.700]   So I want to take a little bit of a turn.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:52.440]   Okay, if you've been listening to this episode, you already know that I'm a huge fan of Daffy.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.460]   They're a not-for-profit community built around a new modern way to give, and they have a
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:02.060]   mission I think we can all get behind, helping people be more generous more often.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.440]   A Daffy account makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.220]   You can make a one-time contribution, or you can set a little aside each week, month, or
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.220]   quarter.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.380]   And because Daffy Charitable Fund is a registered 501(c)(3), all your contributions are tax
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.380]   deductible.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:23.580]   Then, whenever you want, you can give to more than 1.5 million charities, schools, and faith-based
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.020]   organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:31.540]   So you can separate the decision to give and get your tax deduction from deciding exactly
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.780]   which organization you want to support.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.820]   And my favorite part is that all the contributions to your Daffy account are invested in a standard
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.580]   ESG or crypto portfolio, so they can grow tax-free to let you have even more impact
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.580]   in the future.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.500]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today, and for a
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.800]   limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the charity
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   of your choice.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.020]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:09.380]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size, and the cracks start to
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.380]   emerge.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.300]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week, and you have too many manual processes,
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.500]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.860]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, 1.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.860]   37,000.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.900]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm excited
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.300]   to partner with them for this episode.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.780]   It is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial management,
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.100]   inventory, HR, and more.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.100]   25.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.020]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:46.420]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days, not
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.980]   weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.180]   And 1.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.340]   Because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for all your
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.980]   KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.220]   Reduce risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.980]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the companies
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.940]   I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:21.780]   excellent performance, absolutely free, at allthehacks.com/netsuite.

[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.700]   N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.740]   And talk about, you know, this is all the hacks.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:40.740]   One of the things that's interesting for people who have W-2 income is that there aren't a
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.340]   lot of hacks, right?
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.900]   I get lots of questions, "Oh, you know, I have a job, you know, what are the hacks to
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   save money on my taxes?"
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.460]   And I'm like, "Well, okay."
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.540]   So it's like retirement accounts, pre-tax accounts, like HSAs and FSAs, and charitable
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.540]   donations.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.940]   If I'm missing anything, let me know.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:00.580]   I know there's some like technical high-end trust stuff, but for the broad strokes.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:06.940]   And I think I find that people often misunderstand what, you know, some of these tax deductions,
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.940]   how they work.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.220]   Could you just, at a high level, explain the tax benefits the government offers people
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.780]   for being charitable?
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.780]   And I want to be careful.
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.940]   I'm obviously not an accountant, as it turns out.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.940]   So I'm sure they are.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.940]   Of course.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:20.940]   Take...
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.940]   Me either.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.940]   I don't have to make a disclosure here, but I will.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.700]   Do not take what I'm giving you as financial advice.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.460]   Not a professional accountant, et cetera, but no, actually, it's well known that the
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.460]   charitable deduction in the US is one of the most generous.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.820]   And the reason it's generous is because it actually is a deduction against AGI, against
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.380]   your income, right?
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.020]   Which tends to have the highest tax rates.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.980]   And so it's a very useful deduction.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:49.780]   You can deduct right now up to 50% of your AGI, actually, in some cases, 60%, which is
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.140]   a really high number.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.940]   If you think about where most deductions tap up now, the one catch is you have to be someone
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.100]   who itemizes their deductions.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.780]   And ever since the 2017 Tax Act, there are fewer people now.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:08.180]   But for most people who live in high tax states who have a mortgage, they probably itemize
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.260]   deductions, or could very quickly if you make a charitable deduction.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:17.300]   So the great thing about charitable deductions is that they are an incredible benefit from
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   taxes.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.940]   The problem is, as you know, the tax year is one year.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:27.380]   And because our tax rates go up, our system isn't very good for dealing with what happens
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.180]   when people have lumpy income, right?
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.620]   You have big years, you have down years, even though that's becoming more and more common
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.260]   across the United States.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.860]   People's income isn't steady every year, there really are good years and bad years.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.700]   The charitable deduction is most valuable in those good years, right?
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.720]   Because those are the years when you tend to be worried about taxes.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:52.140]   But that stresses that other part of the problem, which is, wait, do you know who to give the
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.420]   money to?
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.980]   And that actually catches a lot of people.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.660]   There's a lot of people in November, December, who realized that they had a good year, that
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.100]   their tax bill is going to be higher than expected and say, "Wow, this would really
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.340]   be a good time to give some money to charity."
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.160]   But unfortunately, they don't have enough time to pick a charity.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.120]   And that's where donor advised funds come in.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.220]   Donor advised funds are basically a special type of account.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.620]   You know, the way that an IRA is for retirement and a 529 is for college savings, a donor
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.680]   advised fund is for charity.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.480]   And the great thing about donor advised funds is because they're offered by nonprofits,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.680]   by charities, you get a tax deduction immediately when you put the money in the account.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   And so as a result, the best tax hack around charitable deductions is to make that commitment
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.720]   to give, put the money in a donor advised fund, get the tax deduction, and then you
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.680]   have time to figure out which organizations to give it to.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.960]   And then for many of these donor advised funds, that money can be invested.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.000]   So it's not sitting idle while you're figuring out who to give to.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.720]   The money is still invested and growing, but now tax deferred, like a Roth IRA or another
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.840]   tax deferred account.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.960]   My first experience with donor advised funds came in the scenario you described where I
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   was like, "Oh, it's a higher tax year, which is always a good year."
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.420]   And I was like, "Gosh, we should just donate."
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.720]   And funny enough, you said earlier, your advice from your accountant was 10 years.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.000]   My advice was also like, "Well, I don't know how much to give, but this is a higher tax
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   year.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.560]   I'd rather give next year's donations this year.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.520]   And I'd probably rather give the next year's donations this year."
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.600]   And I was like, "Well, let's just go 10 years out, take what we were going to give for the
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   next 10 years."
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.880]   Which we had to figure out also because we didn't even have a number at the time.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.440]   And we put that in a donor advised fund.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.520]   And I learned a few things in the process.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.220]   And I want to go get to one in a minute, which is about donating the most appreciated things
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   in your portfolio.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.760]   And we could talk about why.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.920]   I also learned that even organizations that seemed like they had decent products at the
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.440]   time when this happened, Vanguard, Fidelity, they had websites, you could log in, you could
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.560]   buy stocks.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.120]   And then I logged into their donor advised portal and I was like, "This is just a different
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   company."
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.840]   And I think legally, it actually is a different company.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.540]   But I was blown away that the innovation on donor advised funds, even for organizations
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.000]   that have innovated their investing products, was just completely absent.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.600]   I assume that might be part of the founding story here.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.640]   But what about the industry did you find that made you say, "We should go build something,"
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.520]   despite there being lots of organizations out there?
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.480]   Well, there's a lot of reasons.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.560]   I think there's two things that lead to the effect that you saw with existing donor advised
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   funds.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.720]   One that's pretty simple and one that's probably more nuanced.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.800]   The simple reason why it is true is that to offer a donor advised fund, you have to be
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   a non-profit.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.720]   But non-profits have trouble investing in technology and operations and all the things
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.600]   that they need to do to run a donor advised fund.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.560]   So they almost always partner with a for-profit company that helps them operate and fund the
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   development of the firm.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:59.200]   And so Fidelity Charitable partners with Fidelity Investments, Schwab Charitable with Schwab,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.360]   of course Vanguard Charitable partners with Vanguard.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.680]   And so they're all partnered with investment firms, right?
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   Not technology firms.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.160]   And so it is a little bit of the founding story with DAFI.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.400]   DAFI, of course, stands for the Donor Advised Fund for You.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.120]   But we said, "Well, what if instead of partnering with an investment firm, you partnered with
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.760]   a venture-backed technology company, right?
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.440]   Could you have the same type of engineers, the same type of quality design that we're
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.160]   used to seeing from Facebook and Google and Apple and the best kind of companies in the
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   industry?
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.240]   Could we see that here?"
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.280]   And so that's a little bit of the founding story.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.600]   The second reason, though, is more subtle, which is that because they've partnered with
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.620]   investment firms, almost every donor advised fund out there, their business model is charging
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.200]   you a percent of assets.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   And that sounds fun.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.080]   It's a very normal thing in the investment industry, right?
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.200]   Even Vanguard does it, right?
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.600]   A percent of your fund.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:54.040]   The problem there, though, is that because they are charging a percent of assets, they
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.980]   really are only interested in very large accounts, right?
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.600]   And so when you think about this, like you might have a large account, say, for retirement.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.020]   That's your whole retirement.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.020]   College is expensive.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.740]   You might save a lot for college.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:13.220]   You have to be very wealthy to have six and seven-figure or even bigger accounts allocated
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.220]   for charity.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.640]   I mean, it's fantastic, but that's a very big number to put out there.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.100]   And so as a result, those firms mostly optimize their services around the very wealthy, those
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   biggest accounts.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.360]   I mean, Vanguard, I love Vanguard.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.020]   It's one of my favorite firms, changed the industry, idolized.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.680]   But even their donor advised fund, you can't even open with less than $25,000.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.780]   That's their minimum.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.940]   And they charge 60 basis points all the way up to $500,000.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.100]   And so I think that's the other problem that you see that the reason they don't invest
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.260]   in technology heavily there is they're not hitting a mass market audience.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.100]   They're mostly hitting people who already have financial advisors and accountants who
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.620]   probably do it for them.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.620]   That makes sense.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.860]   And is the reason why a firm like Vanguard, which is known for low fees and for their
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   consumer products, doesn't charge as high as 60 basis points, can they get away with
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:12.140]   it because it's already money that's been given away and there's just not as much scrutiny
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.300]   over the fees?
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.740]   Because it's like, "Look, I'm going to give away, in their case, $25,000.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.220]   The fees are coming out of money that's not mine anymore.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.820]   I'm not paying the fees.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.500]   They're coming out of what would otherwise go to charity."
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:28.780]   Does that make people less frustrated with high fees, or how are a firm like Vanguard
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.660]   getting away with charging so much when I can't imagine there's a lot more overhead
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.220]   to operate this than a regular investment account?
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.220]   Well, let's be clear.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:43.040]   I think Vanguard has such a great corporate culture and structurally set up.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.580]   I don't think that those are their motivations, right?
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:50.820]   I think there are other real reasons where because of their lack of investment in technology
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.260]   and because of the way they run their donor advised fund, it might actually be very expensive
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.900]   for them to operate.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.700]   And so those fees actually reflect their costs.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.640]   But I do think that some of the things you talked about are correct.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.500]   I think there is a problem.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.820]   We've all grown up through this industry.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.220]   There was a time where people didn't know to look at how much their mutual funds were
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.680]   charging them.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.980]   And we had to socialise this idea of actually looking at the expense ratios, right?
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.880]   And all the fees tied with mutual funds, 401ks.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   We had to teach people to look at the fees around 401ks, advisors.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.260]   How much is your advisor charging?
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.180]   I've asked dozens of people how much they're paying for their donor advised fund.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.700]   Most people don't even know.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.120]   It's not on the account statement.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.540]   There's no number there.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.220]   I've talked to people who are paying literally hundreds, sorry, hundreds of dollars, even
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.500]   thousands of dollars a year for their donor advised fund, but they don't even know it.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.460]   So I do think that with most donor advised funds, the reason they charge what they do
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.360]   is because they can.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.120]   The tax benefit is high enough that it usually is a net positive for wealthy people who open
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.540]   donor advised funds, right?
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.380]   So if you were lucky enough to have stock in one of the companies that went public in
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.900]   the last couple of years, or you invested in crypto, right?
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.000]   So you have Bitcoin that you bought for $1,000 that's now worth $41,000.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.500]   There's so much tax benefit from donating those assets and not having to pay those capital
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:14.940]   gains taxes that it's true, probably the high end market for donor advised funds just isn't
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.140]   that fee sensitive.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.420]   But I think a lot of the problem has to do with structurally what the industry has done
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.420]   to date.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   And you're right.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.660]   At Daffy, we're hoping to change that.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   And you mentioned donating those appreciated assets.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.820]   Could you walk through maybe an example of the kind of impact donating something that's
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:36.940]   been appreciated would have on your kind of financial situation and the impact it would
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.420]   have on the organizations that it would ultimately go to?
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.740]   The reason the benefit of donating assets is because you really win both ways.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.180]   We already talked about the fact that the charitable deduction is a great deduction
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.180]   to have, right?
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:53.060]   So if you were going to donate $1,000, getting $1,000 off your income on your taxes, I mean,
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.860]   especially if you're in a high tax state like California, New York, etc, that can be more
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.380]   than 50%.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.040]   That's a huge number in the aggregate federal state, etc.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   But when you donate an appreciated asset, stock, crypto, you never have to pay the capital
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.020]   gain as well.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.320]   And so it ends up being not only better for you, it ends up being better for the nonprofit.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.960]   I wrote a recent post about this with real numbers kind of running through, but it's
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   very, very clear.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.160]   Use that Bitcoin example that I gave.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.600]   If you bought a Bitcoin for $1,000, and it's now worth $41,000, right, well, if you sold
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.520]   that Bitcoin, right, you'd owe quite a bit in taxes on it, state, federal, like capital
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.480]   gains, etc.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.500]   And if you donated the money left over, you would have money left over, but it would be
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.620]   minus the taxes, right?
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.640]   If you donate the Bitcoin to charity, you get the full charitable deduction for that
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   $41,000 amount.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.200]   You never pay the capital gain.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   So you have more money now to give to charity, plus you are getting that $41,000 charitable
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.840]   deduction off the top.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.440]   So you're winning both ways.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.800]   So it's very clear how the numbers work out.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.960]   If you are in the fortunate enough position to have appreciated assets, and you can donate
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.200]   those, it's better for everyone involved.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.040]   And then of course, the one problem with it is it turns out not every nonprofit is set
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.500]   up to actually accept stock or crypto.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.480]   And this is actually one of the benefits of donor advised funds.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.040]   One of the great things about Daffy, one of our first donations was actually to a local
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.040]   synagogue.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.400]   One of our constituents wanted to donate Bitcoin to that synagogue.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:35.080]   The synagogue wasn't set up to take Bitcoin, but they were able to download the Daffy app,
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.240]   contribute the Bitcoin to their donor advised fund, get the full tax deduction, of course,
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.160]   and then they let us take care of actually getting the money to the synagogue.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.280]   It's a fantastic benefit.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.720]   I think most tax advisors, most financial advisors you talk to will recommend at the
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:53.520]   end of the tax year that if you have appreciated assets and you want to give money to charity,
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.960]   donating appreciated assets is clearly the best way to do it.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.440]   I love that you can disintermediate this question because one of my things at the end of the
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:06.520]   year is, okay, what in my portfolio has enough gains that it would make for a good donated
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   asset?
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.760]   The stock that you might have bought 12 years ago could almost be in anything if it was
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.960]   12 years ago is probably appreciated quite a bit.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.280]   And that's something that I've taken advantage of.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.960]   Or if you happen to work at a company and you've been there a long time and you hold
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.800]   some stock from the early days, there are circumstances I've had friends where it's
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.600]   literally almost 100% gains and you kind of get the most maximum effect.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.960]   So I love that.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   And there's a fun hack there.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   It's actually one of the examples I use.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.180]   So my first job out of school was actually at Apple.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.360]   Clearly I should have held more of that stock because it turned out the run from the 90s
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.720]   to now is once in a lifetime.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.320]   But fundamentally, yeah, for employees, people who hold company stock, it doesn't have to
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.960]   be all or nothing either, right?
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.800]   Like to use your example, if you have 500 shares of Apple, for example, and a lot of
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:58.580]   it has a lot of gains, you can donate a hundred shares of Apple, get that great tax deduction,
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.960]   and that can actually help cover the taxes from selling some of the rest of your stake,
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.560]   those other 400 shares.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.320]   And so a lot of people actually do that thinking at the end of the year, if they have an advisor,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   they help them with it.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.440]   And if they do it themselves, though, it's very much thinking about, okay, what's my
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.320]   tax bill going to be?
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   Do I have some appreciated assets I could donate?
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:22.520]   Or if I want to liquidate something, do I have other appreciated assets I can use to
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.800]   help defray some of those taxes?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.200]   And to your point, it doesn't have to be some go-go stock, it doesn't have to be Bitcoin.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:35.060]   In some years, I've actually donated old ETF shares, a VTI that I've had for a long time,
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.200]   because it has appreciated quite a bit and has a very low cost basis.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.080]   So once you get that in your head, you realize it's something you probably should do every
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   year, right?
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.800]   There's no time between Thanksgiving and the New Year's.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.280]   You should probably think about what your taxes are going to be.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.160]   If they're going to be higher than you expected, think about, is this a good time to give money
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   to charity?
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.920]   And if it is, look for appreciated assets to do it, and then just put it in a donor
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.460]   advised fund.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.880]   And now you have an account dedicated to charity.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.900]   So anytime you want to give, you have money already set up to do so.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.340]   It's almost like the opposite is you've got tax loss harvesting, and then you've got tax
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.480]   gain harvesting for the purpose of donating.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.440]   Yeah, this is this is exactly right.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.040]   And you know, I know you're a Wealthfront, and I have always will have a soft spot for
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.040]   Wealthfront, etc.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.240]   One of the things we learned at Wealthfront is that people don't always think of the tax
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.880]   liability that's sitting in the shares they own, right?
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.840]   They remember what they bought the stock at or what they bought crypto at.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.560]   They know where it is now.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.880]   They don't think enough about what the taxes are going to be when they sell it, because
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.960]   it turns out you have to pay them.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.520]   Once you have this idea that, oh, I can donate assets to charity, it doesn't have to just
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.120]   be cash.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.020]   It really opens up your thinking of how to make sure that, you know, you invest for the
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:48.640]   long term, you have these assets with a low cost basis, and then you can do a lot of good
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.000]   with them by donating them to charity.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.400]   If you have, like I did, a donor advised fund already at another institution, you can donate
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.560]   that to another donor advised fund.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:04.000]   So Fidelity Charitable, if you're listening, sorry, I no longer have a donor advised fund
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   with you.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   I moved it all to Daffy.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.460]   So that was one thing that I didn't realize because it is also another charity.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.700]   So you can move them around.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.060]   So while you can never get the money out, right, you've donated it, it's irrevocable,
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.080]   you can move it to another donor advised fund.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.600]   So you're not locked into whatever you're using today.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Yeah, this is another thing.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.520]   You know, I remember one of the things that's kind of the bane of the industry a little
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.360]   bit is somehow rolling over 401ks is still incredibly difficult.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.040]   We've been talking about this for decades, but somehow the firms that hold 401ks just
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.280]   make it really, really hard to get your own money to another institution.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.380]   Donor advised funds aren't quite as bad, but they really do not make it obvious that if
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.720]   you ever want to move any of the money, you can move all of it, you can move some of it,
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.180]   you can always move it to another donor advised fund.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180]   And yes, of course, I'm biased.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.420]   You know, with Daffy, I've had a lot of friends, they have donor advised funds.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.600]   Actually, it was a feature we missed in our launch.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.260]   When we launched a few months ago, we didn't have support in the app for transfers.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.820]   We now do, of course.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.500]   And it was really surprising how many people wanted to move money over and they didn't
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   know how.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.500]   And it turns out it's really simple, right?
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:09.020]   If you have a donor advised fund, Daffy Charitable Fund has an EIN.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.180]   It's another nonprofit.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.180]   You just make a grant to us.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.020]   And listen, Chris, totally appreciate moving the whole account over.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   That's fantastic.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.100]   But the truth is from our point of view, anything that makes you comfortable with is great.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.680]   So if you want to move over $1,000 to test it out or a few hundred dollars, if you want
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.840]   to move over half the account, it's all easy.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.460]   You just pick the amount, make the grant to Daffy Charitable Fund.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.620]   They end up mailing us a check.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.180]   A lot of the industry still runs on checks as it turns out.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.060]   And we credit it to your account and it gets invested in your portfolio, however you selected
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.320]   when you signed up.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.320]   It was pretty easy.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.220]   I mean, obviously, on the behind the scenes, it sounds like it was less easy and that a
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.460]   check had to go in the mail.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.700]   For me, it seemed pretty straightforward.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.500]   Well, you probably saved a lot of money doing it because those AUM fees are actually quite
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.820]   high.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.980]   For me, it was save money and it wasn't my money because I've already donated.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.020]   So save money for other organizations.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.740]   The other thing that I thought was interesting with the product you built, I don't know how
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.660]   many other donor advised funds have apps, but I don't think Fidelity Charitable did.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.660]   They actually do.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.620]   Believe it or not, Fidelity Charitable, Fidelity is always well known for some of their investment
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:12.620]   in technology.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.620]   I realize in the brokerage industry, it's hard to give anyone the gold medal, but Fidelity
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.300]   has a decent reputation for investing in technology.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.060]   But even they, they have an app where you can make donations.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.760]   But if you want to open an account, contribute, change your investments, you can't do any
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.300]   of that from the app.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.640]   When we launched Daffy, that was actually one of the big differentiators up front and
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   still is.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.140]   We are the only fully functional donor advised fund in the app store, one where you can open
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.040]   an account, contribute, cash, stock, crypto.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.540]   You can invest the money and of course, make donations to any legal charity in the US.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.920]   So yeah, it's hard to believe that in 2022, that's a rare thing.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.220]   But I think that's because most people don't know about donor advised funds.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.860]   Like I said, historically, it's been this attach rate kind of bespoke product that advisors
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   use, right?
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:02.460]   Like most of the energy at the institutions for it is just a way for them to make sure
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.400]   the assets stay with them.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.080]   Fidelity knows that if you're going to donate stock and you're going to put it into a donor
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.220]   advised fund, it's better to put it in the Fidelity donor advised fund, right?
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.660]   And they optimize for that experience.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.460]   As a result, they don't really think about the fact that a lot of people start their
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.660]   experience these days with an app, right?
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.900]   They started the app store, they don't necessarily start it with a search or by walking into
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.700]   a branch.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.540]   I found that one of the great things about an app experience when it comes to donating
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:32.180]   was in this Ukraine example, we were like, "Oh, we found an organization."
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.180]   My wife's like, "Oh, I found this one."
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.780]   You didn't have to go to the website and type in all of your name and your billing information.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.420]   It was almost too easy.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.660]   And that's not a criticism, but it was like this organization, yes.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:51.180]   And I remember sharing a note that I assumed someone that follows me could see, but it
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.180]   was like, "Done."
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.580]   And it was like, "Okay, let's do another one."
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.860]   It made it easy enough that hopefully, it will help remove some of the friction because
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.860]   I know it did for us.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.860]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.860]   And I love that.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.640]   I mean, our mission as an organization, as a company is to help people be more generous
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.860]   more often.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.220]   And it's true.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   There's a lot of times we have the instinct, we have the urge to give, but all that friction
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.340]   gets in the way, right?
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:20.040]   I'm going to go home, I'm going to get an email, I'm going to have to go to a website.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.420]   There's all this extra work.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.660]   How often do you end up, like I have kids, I have four kids, I can't tell you how many
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.980]   back to school nights I've been at and sat through the presentation, where they walk
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.260]   through and they have a fund.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.580]   Maybe it's to support after school sports or art supplies or something that supports
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.580]   the school.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.460]   And you're like, "Okay, I'm going to give to support."
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:41.780]   What you write a note to yourself, I'm old school, so I send myself an email so that
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.180]   when I get home, at some point, I remember to like go to the website and donate.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.060]   But when you have the app, tap, tap, tap, you're done.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:53.260]   In downtown Los Altos, a couple months ago, there was a minister doing a bake sale for
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.860]   his organization, which is actually in Oakland.
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.940]   And I had a great conversation with him, found out more about the organization, wanted to
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   support them.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.620]   Actually didn't want the bake sale because it turns out I shouldn't eat as many things
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:04.940]   for bake sales right now.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.420]   But I wanted to give some money and the fact that I could pull out my app, type in the
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:13.700]   name of his organization, put in $100, donate that money, have it go to him.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:18.240]   It made it easier to give and it actually felt great because I didn't have this thing
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.700]   also hanging over my head.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.140]   There was no to-do item.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.760]   There was no weird anxiety.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.860]   I wasn't worried about keeping track of the donation.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.340]   I knew it was all in my app.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.580]   Actually, surprisingly, one of the features people seem to love a lot, we just went through
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.480]   our first tax season.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.980]   And so just the fact that you don't have to chase down donation receipts at the end of
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.460]   the year for your account, it's amazing how many people hate whatever system they have.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.000]   They print out receipts and keep them in a folder by their desk.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.160]   They have like a Gmail search that they do.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.620]   So it just turns out to be very convenient.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.980]   I think the app is a game changer.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.980]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.580]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.580]   Anything we missed?
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.940]   One of the things I've run into is that there are some people out there who like this idea
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:00.820]   of putting money aside for charity, like theoretically, and they like the tax benefit, but they don't
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.140]   like the idea of money sitting idle, right?
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.260]   In their head, they feel like there's this return that money should have.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.220]   And so one of the things we designed into Daffy from the get-go was the ability that
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.020]   when you open your account, you can pick from one of nine portfolios to invest your money
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   in.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:21.140]   We have standard ETF portfolios, low cost, all Vanguard ETFs, only four basis points
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.420]   for the entire portfolio.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.240]   We have ESG portfolios, which are mostly BlackRock products.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.500]   They're slightly more expensive, but for many people, they want to align their investing
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.580]   with their giving and their values.
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.020]   And then, of course, we have, because it's 2022, we have pure crypto portfolios.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.340]   Coinbase is one of our investors.
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:41.100]   And so if you want to put your money into a diversified portfolio that includes crypto
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.740]   or even a pure crypto portfolio of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we do that for people.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.180]   And that's been really popular.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.340]   It turns out that that's a very hard feature to get.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:54.880]   Most donor advised funds out there do not have crypto options, either for contribution
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.020]   or for investing.
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.300]   And a lot of the transfers we've been receiving for donor advised funds, existing ones, are
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.800]   because we actually have crypto as an option.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.020]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   for you.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.620]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.660]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.540]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:25.500]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:30.180]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:35.200]   And everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.260]   commonly found in plants.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:42.720]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.780]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.340]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:57.060]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:02.140]   metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.500]   things to drink.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.100]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.980]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.580]   Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.980]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free US
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.140]   shipping, free returns, and a money backed guarantee.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.740]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.660]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.780]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.

[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:48.700]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.480]   to your new year routine.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.060]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:57.220]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.620]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:06.140]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their craft from
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:11.100]   the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.140]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.020]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:22.460]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:26.380]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.660]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.700]   and it's so delicious.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.900]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:44.700]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:50.420]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:54.020]   That's allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.820]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.580]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:08.660]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts from our partners, you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.860]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.200]   I also want to jump into the course you teach.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.900]   So I looked up, you wrote a blog post and you shared some of the ratings and it seemed
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.900]   like everyone loved your class.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:26.180]   There was like seven questions and no one said this was not well or extremely poor.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.180]   And I'll send a link.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.980]   You actually publish all the slides for the class, which is Personal Finance for Engineers.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.180]   I'll put the link in the show notes.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.540]   People can check it out.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:38.380]   But outside of philanthropy, outside of giving, what do you think people are getting wrong
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:39.940]   about personal finance?
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.380]   What I always see repeatedly is people looking for this secret to get wealthy.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:45.380]   This one trick.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.500]   I'm old enough to remember the infomercial age, you know, late night, the guy on the
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.840]   boat telling you, like, you could be rich tomorrow and do whatever.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.360]   But I know it sounds silly, but I feel like it's an evergreen market.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.080]   Like I see every cycle, people looking for this kind of get rich quick.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.160]   It could be get rich quick with crypto.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.760]   It could be with real estate.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:07.160]   All these different options, the right type of account, the right type of insurance, etc.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:11.160]   And I think the biggest mistake that people make is not realizing that the most likely
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:18.320]   path to success is to focus on your career, which by the way, has a high tie to your income,
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.320]   right?
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.320]   The top line is actually a big deal.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.280]   For many people, it's easier for them to figure out how to make an extra $10,000 than it actually
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.760]   is for them to figure out how to save $10,000.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.040]   It's one of these funny things about society.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:34.040]   Focus on your income, your skills, your career, that top line.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.520]   Spend less than you make, right?
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.020]   And by the way, to your point earlier about increasing things over time, increasing your
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.000]   savings rate over time, right?
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.120]   How many people actually save 10% of their income because they live off their salary
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.960]   and they don't spend the bonus, right?
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.640]   That's a very easy way in some ways to just not build up a lifestyle that assumes you're
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.480]   making that money.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.440]   And so I think that a lot of people get the basics wrong.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.520]   They want to jump to these special things and they focus so much on things that if you
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.800]   actually do the financial work, will earn them basis points, right?
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.000]   One hundredth of a percent, 10 basis points, half a percent, 1%.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   And I'm not going to pretend that doesn't matter.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.980]   You compound an extra percent over 30 years, it's a lot of money.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.760]   But it's not as big as just focusing on the basics.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.360]   And then by the way, this gets even worse with couples and with households, right?
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.840]   Like the amount of dysfunction with the way spouses treat money or the way people fail
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:32.040]   to plan together or even talk about money with each other probably has a lot more to
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:37.360]   do with financial problems people have than the fact that they didn't buy Tesla stock
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   five years ago.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.640]   I think that tracks with some past conversations we've had.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:48.120]   But one thing that keeps coming up and I noticed it was interesting, your final course seems
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.360]   to be a grab bag of what do people want to talk about?
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.360]   That's right.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.960]   And it's probably no surprise to anyone listening that it's like, let's talk about venture capital
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   and crypto.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   And, you know, I even saw a slide that talked about NFTs.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.480]   Where do you think some of the more exciting things fit into place?
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.080]   And I'll use you as an example.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.680]   Obviously, you know, you've been fortunate with some of your career choices and the companies
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.260]   you've worked at, but eventually you got to a point that you're doing lots of angel investing.
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:21.760]   How do some of these alternative investments fit in and not necessarily to the path to
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.880]   wealth, if you will, but to your investment portfolio?
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.200]   You know, you've thought a lot about investing at Wealthfront, also at Daffy for your own
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   life.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.640]   How do you think things like investing in startups fits in?
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.160]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.980]   And I don't want to pretend that I think that those things are irrational or not worth doing.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.240]   If you do the math and you think about the system, a lot of these investments can make
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.440]   sense in some situations, right?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:50.160]   The idea of having a small percentage of your portfolio in private equity isn't outlandish,
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   right?
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.920]   Like, you know, some of the best money managers in the world who run endowments, etc, allocate
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.980]   money to private equity and venture capital for good reason.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.760]   Same thing is happening, by the way, with alternative asset classes, right?
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.160]   You know, it's been more than 10 years, but the data is coming in.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:09.240]   And I have to be honest, from my point of view, it seems like this argument on crypto,
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   which you saw in the slides, that says no, digital assets seem to be a different asset
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:19.460]   class, they behave differently, they have different basis, they are not completely correlated
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.800]   with other asset classes.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:26.400]   And as a result, they might be an interesting addition to a diversified portfolio is a very
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.720]   rational question to ask.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.800]   Actually, I cover a lot of this in my class, I don't have a problem with these assets.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:36.200]   Like I said, the problem is less that people stay away from these things irrationally.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   It's usually the opposite.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.560]   They, you know, I got a question asked on Twitter just the other day where, you know,
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.860]   I was talking about crypto, acorns actually added crypto as an option to their portfolio
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.960]   similar to the way that Wealthfront did.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.440]   And the question came in, well, if crypto is so good, why don't you put all your money
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   into it?
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.360]   And it's like, whoa, like, that's, that's actually never the answer.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:58.740]   Diversification turns out to be a pretty good deal from most perspectives.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.260]   But I do like the education to it.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.400]   So each of these topics are different.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   It's a Stanford class, right?
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:08.720]   So not talking about venture capital and private equity and a Stanford class, Stanford, I mean,
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.840]   it would just read wrong.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.400]   So it's not surprising that students always want to know many of them are going to end
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.480]   up going to work for startups or venture backed startups, etc.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.080]   Some of them will go into venture capital.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:21.520]   Crypto is one of these interesting overlaps where I mean, I will tell you, as someone
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   who came out of school as an engineer, you know, computer science, etc.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.760]   I've run into digital assets many times in my career.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.400]   My first startup that I joined is like the fifth engineer was on digital software distribution,
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.440]   encryption, and how do you do this and this hard problem of what do you do with the fact
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   that software can be perfectly copied for free is actually something that was endemic
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.560]   to the entire industry last 50 years.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:50.320]   Like how can you make money on software, if people can make a perfect copy for free, right?
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.840]   This has affected music and all forms of media.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.260]   Even at eBay, I remember doing a strategy once on what eBay's digital asset strategy
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.720]   should be digital goods strategy.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.760]   And at the time, it was not solvable.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.360]   Because if you didn't have a central authority, like what Apple did for iTunes, you couldn't
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.640]   build that platform.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.320]   So for me, crypto is a very exciting technology area.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.700]   There's a lot of interesting work being doing, the energy is phenomenal.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.640]   But from a financial point of view, the simple argument is like, let's, let's go to first
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.640]   principles, right?
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.840]   Like, do you think digital assets are a thing that have unique value?
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.940]   Is it a different thing?
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.080]   Does it have value?
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.160]   And will it have value long term?
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.680]   And then what are the characteristics of that type of investment?
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.300]   To me, those are actually perfectly appropriate for a class.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.640]   And I think a lot of the students enjoyed going through it.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.720]   I was actually surprised crypto was not as popular a topic in any of the previous years
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.720]   as I would have expected.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.860]   I expected every student to vote for it.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:47.020]   It turns out the most popular topic with students that they asked for in the beginning continues
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.000]   to be real estate.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.320]   I don't know what branding or marketing is going on that's pushing real estate.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.520]   But maybe it's just that you're in Silicon Valley, it's one of those areas where no one
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.240]   can figure out how you could ever buy a house.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.640]   And so, you know, real estate is just one of those options.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.400]   But I actually dedicated a whole class to real estate, because there were so many requests
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400]   for it.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:10.080]   Yeah, there was a slide you had that was interesting, because I feel like every time I talk to people,
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.400]   there's people who are like, the path to wealth is to own rental properties.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.040]   And then there's everyone else.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.480]   And that cohort of people believe that that is the best investment class.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.200]   Yeah, that's an area that I flipped around on.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.760]   If you had talked to me 10 years ago, I probably mostly would have said there's some really
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.840]   unhealthy marketing push that's across society in the industry that keeps pushing people
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:36.780]   towards rental real estate as somehow the best path to financial freedom.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:40.080]   That being said, I mean, the Federal Reserve, there was a paper that came out at the end
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.840]   of 2017, I shared in my class, etc, that kind of exposed the fact that most of the data
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.800]   that historically been aggregated about real estate did not include rental income, right?
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.560]   So most of the data you saw about real estate as an asset class, covered the idea of the
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.480]   capital gains from it and not the income from it.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.120]   And so they did a very good job of looking across 20 different cities in the Europe and
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.960]   the US over 100 years, all different timespans, etc.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.520]   And it turns out there's actually a pretty fair argument that says that rental properties
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.000]   are actually a very interesting asset class.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.960]   They have lower volatility than stocks.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.200]   They don't quite have equity like returns.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.960]   But when you do that sharp ratio, right, when you look at the risk adjusted return, rental
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.240]   properties are better than I think the industry gave them credit for.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.520]   And I'm just saying this as, you know, a personal story of what we cover in the class.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.760]   But I'm not totally surprised it has the draw anymore.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:38.280]   I mean, the truth is a lot of people want control over their financial lives.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.920]   Yeah, look, I'm a founder, right?
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   You've been a founder.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.720]   I think there's a natural instinct from a lot of people, a dream of running their own
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   business.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:50.120]   And in many ways, owning rental properties sounds like a financial investment, but really
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.160]   it's running a business, right?
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.040]   And I think there are a lot of people who like running a business and they like the
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.880]   idea of learning how that business makes money.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.200]   And they like learning how to be successful at it.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.800]   And so it is an investment, but it's also an occupation in a way.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.560]   It's a lifestyle.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.880]   As much as owning a restaurant would be or for you and me, it might be a venture backed
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.000]   software company.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.280]   But I think that I've grown to accept the fact that the reason it's so attractive is
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.160]   because people don't look at it purely as an investment option.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.280]   They look at it also as a better way to live.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.240]   Now, I think where people go astray is, you actually even mentioned this, I think, briefly,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.360]   considering rental property is some form of passive income.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.280]   I think it's too idealistic.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.960]   It's a job, right?
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.240]   No matter how much you invest in property management or whatever, this idea that somehow
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.520]   you're going to be sitting on the beach somewhere and collecting checks does not match the reality
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.400]   that most people who get into rental properties have to think about.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.360]   I think the questions are reasonable.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.080]   And especially, I think, by the way, I don't think those questions are going to wait.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.040]   Looking at what's going on with real estate prices, not just in California or the Bay
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.640]   Area, but nationwide, I mean, we're, everyone got a crash course in real estate in the last
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   20 years.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:03.080]   You had the incredible boom in the 2000s, you had the incredible blow up in 2008, 2009.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.400]   And now we're seeing real estate across the country surge again.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   And now guess what?
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   Inflation's back.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400]   So everyone has that topic.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.000]   And something that seemed like one of those stories that, you know, your parents and grandparents
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.340]   told you, at least in the US, historically, seeing that come back has people looking at
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.340]   real assets again.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.300]   So I think for better or worse, you're going to see a lot of interest in real estate, probably
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.540]   too much, given the realities of it as an asset class, but it is reasonable that people
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.540]   are interested.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:35.540]   As I said, most lawyers are not going to find financial success by investing in rental properties.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.460]   They're going to find financial success by being great lawyers, and actually spending
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.060]   less than they make and investing that capital prudently.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.660]   That's just something that I see in the data.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.220]   It's something that I believe and it's what I teach in the class.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:52.940]   I asked Morgan Housel for his best hack, and it was like, spend less than you earn and
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940]   wait.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.940]   Like, that was, you know...
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:58.600]   Well, you know, Warren Buffett may not be perfect, but I will tell you, sometimes he
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.140]   has just the right quotes.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.140]   And this, I forget which talk show host it was, that question of like, you're very upfront
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.140]   with what you do.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.020]   Why don't more people invest the way you do?
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:14.840]   And he says, well, I found in my life that very few people want to get rich slowly.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.340]   And it's just, it's true, right?
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:21.300]   And by the way, you look at his results, most of his money, over 90% of it was made after
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.300]   he was 70.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.660]   I think some incredible amount of it was made in the last 10 years, right?
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.100]   That's how compounding works.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.380]   Everyone has an urgency to it, and I understand why, right?
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.380]   When you're young, you're young.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.540]   You want money now.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.800]   You want success now.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.540]   You want to build your life now.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.660]   So I think that tension is always going to be there.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:42.060]   And so that's why I'm so bullish on software and systems, right?
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   I think that humans are never going to get their emotions out of the way when it comes
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.060]   to money.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.020]   As much as you can tell people that this is the way they should reinvest their dividends,
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.820]   and this is what they should watch in their expenses, and this is how taxes work.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.820]   We're busy.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.460]   We have other priorities.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.820]   Even if we were fully rational, we probably wouldn't get around to doing it.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.460]   And the fact is we're not fully rational.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.220]   And so this is why I like apps and services.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:08.700]   I like what Wealthfront did for financial advice and for investing.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:13.420]   I like what Acorns does for saving, getting millions of people have some money at the
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.260]   end of the month that they wouldn't have.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.140]   And I'm hoping that's what Daffy ends up helping to do with giving.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.220]   Just systems that make it easier for people to do the right thing with their money.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:27.620]   I want to jump last to the quick few questions outside of finance, outside of giving.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.740]   I always like to ask people, if someone's coming to your neck of the woods, where would
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.900]   you tell them to go for dinner, grab a drink and something to do?
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:40.180]   The number one challenge I usually have when people come in to visit is they are always
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.920]   focused on San Francisco, but I grew up in Silicon Valley.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.700]   When it comes to places, I mean, it depends.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.580]   There's a little place in Los Altos called The Post, which I like to take people for
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   lunch.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.660]   When I take people for lunch, I found that they have a broad enough menu and it's nice
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.900]   enough that no matter where you're from, no matter what diet you're on, no matter what
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.740]   you're avoiding or doing or what, like there's something for everyone.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.700]   And so it tends to work when I have people from out of town.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.980]   Of course, if you're meeting me for coffee, I'm super boring.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.580]   It's always going to be at the Starbucks in Los Altos.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.020]   But for dinner, I mean, I like steakhouses.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.620]   I mean, I'm a huge fan of Alexander's Steakhouse.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.620]   There's several of them.
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.940]   There's one in San Francisco, of course.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:20.700]   There's actually one in Palo Alto called The Sea and there's one down in Cupertino.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.580]   The Cupertino one is the original one.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:28.540]   But if you're looking for a really high quality steak with kind of a more Japanese elements
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.100]   to it, it's really hard to beat in my book.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.100]   That's fantastic.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.580]   Any, any, any suggestion to spend a weekend or an afternoon doing something outside of
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.580]   San Francisco in the Bay Area?
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.660]   Oh, I'm always a big fan of getting outdoors.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.340]   I like taking people, walking them around Stanford.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.500]   Stanford's still a beautiful place that I think actually captures a lot of both California
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.860]   and kind of the environment.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.100]   It's almost always warm and full of life.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.420]   But I like getting outside, actually, like, you know, hiking the Dish, walking shorelines
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.420]   beautiful.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.580]   There's so many parks around that you can actually go to.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.020]   But I'm also going to preface this by saying I'm super boring.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.300]   Like there's a reason why most people don't plan their vacations around me.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.580]   No, I think these are some good tips.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.300]   I really appreciate it.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.180]   Before we head out, where can people find the stuff you're working on, the stuff you're
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.180]   writing online?
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.540]   Oh, for sure.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.820]   So the best place to go, of course, for Daffy, of course, is go to Daffy.org.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   All the content is there.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.060]   A lot to read up on the articles that I've written are on the Daffy blog.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.700]   We have some evergreen resources there.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.780]   So if you're interested in philanthropy or giving or anything, I talked about the generosity,
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.740]   the tax savings on donating stock or crypto, you can find that all in the Daffy blog.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.660]   I do blog personally still, although it turns out building a startup takes time and so not
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.980]   as much as I used to.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.260]   But yeah, my blog has been running AdamNash.blog has most of the information I've published
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.480]   in the last 15 years.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.700]   And then, of course, if you're interested in that Stanford class, it's really meaningful
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:55.780]   for me to push financial education out as broadly as possible.
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.580]   One of the reasons to do the Stanford class was to make it more normalized, that there
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.080]   would be personal finance education.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.100]   And so if you're interested in any of those decks that Chris went through, if you actually
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.780]   go to CS007.blog, all the slides for all the last five years are there.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:13.400]   Yeah, I'll link to all that in the show notes.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.700]   And we said it before, if you if you're going to sign up for Daffy and you want to get an
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.620]   extra $25 in your account, allthehacks.com/daffy.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.980]   Adam, thank you so much for joining me.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   No, thank you for having me, Chris.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   It's great.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:28.220]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.900]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.700]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.500]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.760]   And if you have any feedback on the show questions for me or just want to say hi, I'm Chris
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.740]   at allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:45.740]   That's it for this week.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:09:02.780]   I'll see you next week.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:07.340]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.160]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.500]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.840]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.380]   to save a dollar.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:25.320]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.500]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.500]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:39.060]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.060]   your mind.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:44.940]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.780]   employer's retirement plan.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.420]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.180]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.820]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.680]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.820]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:05.580]   Search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.220]   to podcasts and enjoy.
