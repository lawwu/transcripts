[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   the Gospel according to Saint John, in the fourth chapter, reading verses 10, 13, and
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   14.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.680]   Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.240]   saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.760]   thee living water.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.080]   Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.360]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.160]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.520]   everlasting life.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.160]   Now I read those verses as those who attend here regularly will realize in order to call
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.240]   attention once more to this great statement of the Christian Gospel, this great statement,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.540]   if you like, of the character and of the nature of the Christian salvation that was made by
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.840]   our Lord to this woman of Samaria.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.400]   He uses the occasion of needing a drink of water himself as he sat by the side of the
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.440]   well to instruct her in this profound teaching.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.600]   And what he is doing, of course, is to show her that her trouble in life, as it is indeed
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.680]   the trouble with all others in life, is the failure to realize who he is and what he has
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   to give.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.800]   That is the essence of the Gospel message.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.280]   This is the tragedy of life, that with such an offer confronting us we are so ready to
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.920]   be content with so much less.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.640]   Now this is a great story and it puts it all in a very dramatic form and that is why we
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.560]   have been considering it at such length.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280]   This is what is offered us in the Christian Gospel.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   We are offered this water which if we drink it will become in us a well of water springing
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   up into everlasting life.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.880]   And the question we must ask ourselves still is, do we have this?
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   Are we aware of this?
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.280]   Well in order to help us to face that question we are considering together now the main characteristics
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:40.120]   of this life which is given us by the Son of God, this gift of God which he gives us.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.520]   And then having considered these characteristics of the life we will be in a position to know
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.280]   exactly whether we have it or not.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.080]   Now I am again anxious to impress this point that the greatest trouble with all of us in
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.360]   this Christian life is our tendency to reduce it, to reduce it to the level of our thinking,
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.520]   our understanding and our own experiences.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.560]   That is why it is so essential we should be constantly studying the New Testament and
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.200]   facing here the real thing, the real offer.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.600]   And that is what we are doing now.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.960]   Now I have suggested that you can classify the characteristics of this great life under
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.760]   two main headings.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:35.040]   Certain general characteristics of which the two chief ones are that it is something experimental.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.280]   Christianity is something experimental, something that you know that you have, something that
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.880]   you experience.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   It isn't something theoretical.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.320]   It isn't merely adherence to a philosophy or a point of view.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.520]   It is a life which does something in you.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.120]   Therefore it is essentially experimental.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.920]   And the second general characteristic is that it is obviously always intimately and closely
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.720]   associated with our blessed Lord himself.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.320]   If thou knowest the gift of God and who it is that speaketh unto thee, the water that
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:17.080]   I shall give him, this differentiates it from various false kinds of mysticism and from
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   the various cults that are offering to help people in the battle of life at the present
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   time.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.400]   But now we are at the moment dealing with the more particular characteristics of this
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   life.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   And what we have seen so far is this, that it is something inward, something within.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.480]   The water that I shall give him shall be in him, a well of water.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   We have dealt with this.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.160]   There is nothing more important than this, the inwardness of the Christian faith.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.240]   It is not something outside us.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.280]   That is where it is so different from morality and various schemes and ideas of life.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   It is within.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.680]   It is a heart religion.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.520]   And if we have not got a heart religion, we are not Christians, whatever else we may be.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.480]   You can be religious without being a Christian, and that is one of the best ways of telling
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   the difference.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.120]   Then we saw last Sunday morning that it is a power within us, a power which is working
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.680]   within us in a mighty manner.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.740]   And we must never forget that.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.640]   It is something that makes us become what we are, because it is the dynamic, as it were,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.000]   of the life.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.840]   It is like a well of water springing up within us.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.600]   So you do not have to force yourself.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.280]   It is not you who are doing things what you are doing.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.480]   You are doing because it is God that worketh in us both the will and to do of his good
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.640]   pleasure.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.960]   And we saw at the end what a mighty power it can be.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.280]   You remember how the Apostle Paul ends his great third chapter of the epistle to the
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.240]   Ephesians, for instance, with these tremendous words.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.320]   "Now unto him," he says, "who is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above all that
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.360]   we can ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.080]   Unto him be glory in the church, world without end."
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.480]   Now that is it.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.440]   But now I want to take that a step further and to point out that this is a power, this
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:32.440]   power that works within us, this well of water springing up into everlasting life, is something
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.760]   that changes our life in a radical manner.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   These points, you notice, follow logically one upon the other.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.520]   And it is important that we should take them in that way.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.640]   And this, of course, is again an extremely important point.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.880]   It's a point that is quite inevitable.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.720]   If this power that is working in us is the power of God, and we've seen that it is,
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:09.440]   well then it is obvious that it must be something that changes us in a radical sense, not in
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.160]   a superficial sense, not on the surface, not in the matter of appearances.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:22.800]   Obviously, if this is the life of God in the soul of man, it must produce the profoundest
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.600]   change conceivable.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.680]   And all the language and terminology that is employed concerning this in the New Testament
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.280]   is all, of course, designed to give us that impression of the radical character and nature
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.560]   of this profound change.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.360]   These are some of the terms that are used.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   It is called regeneration.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.000]   Now there's nothing that is profounder than that.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.960]   The Christian faith, Christianity, is not something that merely makes us a little bit
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.040]   better than we were, or improves the appearance, as I say, of the surface.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040]   No, no.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.620]   It is regeneration.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.560]   We have generated anew and afresh.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.760]   In other words, the commoner term used is a rebirth.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.160]   Now this was the essence, of course, of what we already have seen in the third chapter,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.320]   where our Lord, interrupting the speech of that great teacher in Israel, Nicodemus, said,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.800]   "You must be born again."
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:29.760]   You see, Nicodemus dropped into the customary fallacy of thinking that our Lord had just
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.680]   got something extra that he could give him, something that he, Nicodemus, could add on
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.200]   to what he'd already got.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.880]   "No, no," says our Lord.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   You don't understand it.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880]   That's quite wrong.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880]   You've got nothing.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.480]   You need to be born again.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.280]   You must go back to the very beginning.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.160]   The foundation needs to be changed.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.000]   It's as radical as that.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.360]   Now here, of course, is the difficulty that people fail to realize this.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.480]   We will turn Christianity into a religion, or into a philosophy, which we add on.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   But it isn't.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   It's within.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.400]   It's a power, and it's a power that changes us in this radical sense.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.040]   Well, elsewhere, it is compared to a new creation.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.960]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, "If any men be in Christ, he is a new creature,"
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   or a new creation.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.800]   "All things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.520]   Oh, you must have noticed in the reading of that sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:35.640]   Romans at the beginning, that there, the same point is put in this kind of way, that it
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.000]   is comparable to a death followed by a resurrection.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   The end of one life, the beginning of another.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.320]   "Reckon ye yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.880]   Christ our Lord."
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.320]   He uses the picture, the illustration of our Lord himself, crucified, dying upon the cross
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.760]   and his body buried in a grave.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.640]   Then the mighty resurrection in that new glorified life.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.560]   Now, he says that that is what happens to a Christian.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.200]   We've been crucified with Christ, we have died with him, but we've also risen with him
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.600]   in newness of life.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:25.680]   Now, it's impossible to conceive of any stronger comparisons or analogies than these.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.520]   A birth, a resurrection out of death.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:38.000]   Now, that is therefore the language which is implied in the scripture in order to bring
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.320]   out this radical character of the change.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.840]   And there's another one that I myself am very fond of, and which again, you noticed, Paul
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.720]   keeps on using in that sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, as he does in other
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   places.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   "Ye were, ye are."
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.320]   God be thanked that he were the servants of sin, but you have received, you are.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.640]   Now, this is not confined to the apostle Paul.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.920]   The apostle Peter does exactly the same thing.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.440]   He says to those gentle people who become Christians, he says there was a time when
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.680]   you were not a people, but you are now the people of God.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.600]   Here's the contrast.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.880]   Something that you were, something that you are, that you've become.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.360]   And the point is that it is a complete contrast.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.960]   And varieties of expression of this thing are really almost endless.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.840]   But that makes it all the more important that we should grasp the point.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.320]   Another way in which it's put is that it is all the difference between living a life
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.600]   after the flesh and living a life after the spirit.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.720]   They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.000]   the spirit, the things of the spirit.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.040]   And he goes on to remind the Romans in that eighth chapter, "But ye are not in the flesh,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.000]   but in the spirit.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.520]   If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   And so on.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.600]   Well now, there you see, I've given you a number of quotations to show the radical
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.280]   character of this change.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.880]   Perhaps it can all be summed up by putting it like this, that what happens to a man when
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.600]   he becomes a Christian is that he receives a new heart.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.440]   It is nothing less than a change of heart.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.480]   Now it's very important we should remember always that the way in which the Bible uses
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.200]   the term heart is a very special one.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.400]   We tend to think immediately when one uses the word heart of the affections, the emotions,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   the feelings.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.960]   But the scripture doesn't use the term heart in that sense.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.880]   It uses it in a much profounder sense.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.600]   It includes the feelings, but it contains much more than the feelings.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:05.840]   In the scripture, the heart stands for the center of the personality, the very core of
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   one's being.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.320]   There is to every man a center.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.200]   We've got various faculties, we have the body and its propensities and its characteristics,
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.760]   and we have our temperamental differences and so on.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.280]   But there is something at the center that is controlling all this.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.300]   Now that's what the scripture means by the heart, the very spring of life, that which
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.120]   controls what the person is and what the person does.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.800]   Now the older theologians had a very good term for this.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.760]   I know no better, well that's why I use it.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.280]   They talked about one's disposition.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.480]   And so they said that what happens when a man becomes a Christian is that there is a
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:59.560]   profound and a radical change in his disposition, and that he is one who has received a new
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   disposition.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   Now, I've sometimes used an illustration to bring out this point, and I think it's
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   helpful.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.160]   Think of it in terms of management.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.680]   Think of a man running his own business, perhaps employing a number of others to help him.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.240]   But he owns the business.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.760]   He has the direction and the control.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.680]   He is the ultimate authority, and he gives out his orders.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:34.040]   Then suddenly he's brought up or taken over by a big firm or someone else.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.080]   And he may still continue as the kind of manager in the shop.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.880]   And yet you see there is an essential difference here.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.920]   The ultimate central control has been changed.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.800]   The employees are there as before and are doing exactly what they did before, but there
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.840]   has been a change at the central control.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:01.440]   That is an illustration which helps to bring out this idea of what is meant by the disposition,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   that fundamental ultimate thing that controls everything else.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.080]   Now, this is the statement that is made here in this pictorial manner.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   life.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:24.080]   It is a new disposition, and it will govern everything else about this person.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:32.120]   In other words then, we've got to realize that it is a change of the whole of the personality.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.360]   Now I could easily show you that it is the failure to realize that that has accounted
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.560]   for many of the heresies of the past, for many of the freak religious movements of the
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.720]   past.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.240]   It is the failure to realize this that tends to lead us all astray.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.440]   We want to be put right intellectually only, or in the realm of feelings only, or in the
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   realm of activity only.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.240]   But that's not Christianity.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.120]   And it is when the personality is dealt with in a piecemeal manner rather than as a whole
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.320]   that you've got something which is spurious, and not the real Christian thing itself.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:16.800]   Very well then, here is the general statement that this life, this well of water that is
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.880]   put into us, this life of God in the soul, is going to manifest itself in the whole of
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   our personality.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:29.480]   And we've got to consider what these manifestations are.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.760]   Now let me say this, let someone be discouraged.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.800]   It is my business, of course, to represent this at its maximum, at its best, and at its
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.880]   highest.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.400]   The New Testament itself always does that.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.640]   But let no one think that he or she is not a Christian simply because you may find that
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.000]   you haven't got a hundred percent of what I describe.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.880]   All I am concerned about is this.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:02.040]   Are we able to say that on the whole, as a whole, this is true of us?
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:08.760]   If this essential change has taken place, it's bound to manifest itself in these various
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   ways.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.720]   But of course, there are variations in the degree to which it does so.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.120]   The same kind of variation that the Scripture itself teaches us when it says that we are
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.160]   born as babes in Christ, and we may be children.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.880]   Then we become young men, then we become adult, we become old men.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.960]   There is a progression, there is a maturing, there is a development as one goes on in the
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.600]   Christian life under the instruction of the Scripture and the influence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.960]   But in the various babes, there is this essential thing.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.160]   The life shows itself always in the same way.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.120]   And so we can analyze it like this.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:18:01.320]   There is obviously in the Christian a profound change in his mind, in his understanding.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:10.200]   Now here is something again which is illustrated and emphasized constantly in the New Testament.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.640]   This is one of the big differences between a Christian and a non-Christian, a different
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.680]   mind, different understanding, different outlook.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.040]   This is made plain in many, many places.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.440]   Our Lord himself, for instance, does it in his great high priestly prayer which is recorded
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.360]   in the seventeenth chapter of this Gospel according to St. John.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.120]   And he puts it like this.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.520]   He is praying now for these men whom he is going to leave behind him to carry on with
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   his work.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:46.640]   He says, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.280]   Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word."
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.840]   Now these are men that have been given to him out of the world.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.040]   They are separated people.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.400]   They were in the world like everybody else.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.580]   They have been given to him out of the world.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.000]   And he says that they have this characteristic, that they have kept thy word.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.480]   Now he says, "They have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.720]   For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them,
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.520]   and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   send me.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   I pray for them.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.720]   I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine."
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.800]   He then sums it all up at the end of that same prayer in the twenty-fifth verse when
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:43.200]   he says, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.680]   and these, his disciples, have known that thou hast sent me."
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.600]   Now there you see is this big differentiating point.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:01.160]   Here are people who have got this understanding concerning him and concerning his purpose
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   in the world.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.280]   The world in general, the world at large, doesn't have this.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.580]   It doesn't know this.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.760]   It doesn't recognize this.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.080]   Now this is such a vital matter.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:21.360]   If I may say so, I find it increasingly in my pastoral work as people come to me in difficulties
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.200]   about their spiritual or their Christian life.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   And I'm constantly finding myself having to quote these very statements.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.400]   People come to me and say, "You know, I don't think I am a Christian after all.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.280]   I don't think I've ever really been a Christian.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.360]   I have some sort of an experience, or I was forced under pressure in a meeting to say
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.880]   certain things, but you know, I don't think that I am a Christian."
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.240]   And they're distressed about this.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.840]   How can one help them?
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:56.080]   Well this is, I find, one of the best ways of all, is to show them that they've got
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.240]   a new mind, a new understanding.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.560]   Now I generally start by putting it to them like this.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.320]   I say, "Why have you come to see me?
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.120]   Why are you troubled about this?
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.440]   Can't you see that that's important in and of itself?"
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   If they're young people, I put it like this.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.920]   "Can't you see that you as a young person are doing something which is rather exceptional
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.880]   in this modern world?
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.400]   Think of your friends and associates.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.000]   Think of your fellow students or your fellow workers.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.760]   Are they concerned about this thing?
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.880]   Are they interviewing somebody like myself because they're troubled and they're unhappy
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.080]   about this thing and they want to know whether they're Christians or not?
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   Is that their attitude?"
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.080]   And they smile at me.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   "No," they say, "well of course not."
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.720]   I say, "They ridicule the whole thing and they probably think you're a little bit mad
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.400]   in that you are troubled about these things."
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.440]   Immediately I've established that there is a difference in outlook between these people
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   and the others.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   Now, I then take them on, of course, to the second chapter of Paul's First Epistle to
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.560]   the Corinthians where these things are put so plainly and so clearly.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.360]   The apostle is reminding these people that the wisdom which he is talking about in the
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.520]   Gospel is a mystery, the hidden wisdom, he says, "which none of the princes of this world
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.080]   knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   As it is written, 'I have not seen, nor heard, nor have entered the heart of men the things
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.040]   which God has prepared for them that love him.'
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:35.800]   God hath revealed them unto us," that's to say Christians, "by his Spirit.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:41.480]   For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.720]   He goes on, "We have received not the Spirit of the world that is of the world, but the
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.160]   Spirit which is of God, in order that we might know the things that are freely given to us
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.360]   of God, which things also we speak, not in the words which men's wisdom teacheth, but
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.440]   which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:10.200]   Then the crucial verse, "But the natural men," here's the man who's not a Christian, now
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.240]   he may be a very able man, he may be a very moral man, but he's the natural man, he hasn't
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.600]   got the Spirit in him, he hasn't got the well of water, he hasn't got the new life in him,
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.920]   he's a natural man, he may be the natural man at his best, but here's the truth, "The
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:32.160]   natural men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.080]   him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.280]   Now there it is you see.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:45.960]   I say to these people therefore who come to me in trouble, "You are concerned about this,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.400]   yes," they say, "you're troubled, yes.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:55.240]   Very well, you are anxious about these things, yes, you want to know these things, certainly."
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.440]   Well then I say, "You can't be a natural man."
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.680]   The natural men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.320]   unto him, neither can he know.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.880]   Are these things foolishness to you?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.640]   No, no, they say, "I want to know them."
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   Very well I say, you're not a natural man, and if you're not a natural man you must be
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.720]   a spiritual man.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.280]   There's no other possibility.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.280]   You are either natural or spiritual, you are either in the flesh or in the Spirit, and
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.160]   the proof of your being a spiritual person is that you don't regard these things as foolish,
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.440]   but you're anxious about them.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:35.040]   And then Paul goes on, "But he that is spiritual judgeth, hath understanding of all things,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.240]   yet he himself is judged of no man, for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.280]   instruct him?"
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.520]   But we have the mind of Christ.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.720]   Now there is a magnificent and perhaps the clearest of all the statements with respect
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   to this matter.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.400]   But let nobody think that this is just Pauline teaching.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.480]   The Apostle John says exactly the same thing.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:05.080]   Here he is as an old man writing his farewell letter to Christian people, and he's worried
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.840]   about them because he says that certain false teachers have gone abroad, antichrists.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.200]   You see, there were false teachers even in the first century in the early church.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.120]   Let me say once more, there is nothing so fatuous and so ridiculous about these people
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.400]   who pride themselves on their modernity as their ignorance and their failure to realize
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.240]   they're but the modern counterparts and very pale imitators of the false teachers even
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.780]   of the first century, the antichrists, the false teachers.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.680]   But John is quite happy about these people ultimately.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:43.560]   He says this, "They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.440]   of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:53.640]   But they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.320]   Here were people who belonged to the church, but they were now teaching heresy and they've
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.320]   gone.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.880]   And thereby, says John, they're giving proof that they don't really belong to us.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.720]   But then he goes on in the 20th verse of the second chapter of his first epistle, "But
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.400]   you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.240]   I have not written unto you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.000]   that no lie is of the truth."
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.080]   But the thing is, he says, "You've got an unction."
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   What's that mean?
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   Well, it isn't any natural ability.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.880]   It's something they've been given.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.360]   They've got this unction from the Holy One.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.000]   The Holy Spirit is within them.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   In the 27th verse he repeats it, "But the anointing which you have received of him,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.440]   from him, abideth in you."
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:45.320]   Isn't it reminiscent of our Lord's words to the woman of Samaria, "Whosoever drinketh
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:52.680]   the water that I shall give him, it shall become within him a well of water, springing
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.520]   up into everlasting life."
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.640]   The unction, the anointing that you have received of him, abideth in you.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.600]   And you need not that any man teach you, but the same anointing teacheth you of all things
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:12.440]   and is truth and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, you shall abide in him.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:21.600]   Now this, you see, is a perfect way of putting this very point about the change, the radical
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.280]   change in the mind and in the understanding.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:33.320]   This is the first profound manifestation of this new life that is within.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:41.040]   If you like, we can enforce it still further by putting it in terms of certain great contrasts.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.200]   And again the Apostle Paul does this in the fourth chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   in verses 17 and following.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:56.440]   "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you henceforth walk not as the
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.000]   other Gentiles walk."
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   How do they walk?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.160]   How is the world living this morning?
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.240]   What's the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.840]   What is the effect of having this well of water, this life of God within me, this new
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.240]   disposition that governs everything, and especially my mind?
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   Well, here it is, "You henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:27.320]   mind, emptiness of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:33.560]   the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.040]   heart."
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.600]   Could anything be clearer?
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   The trouble with a man who's not a Christian is that his understanding is darkened.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.880]   He's alienated from the life of God.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   Why?
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.560]   Well, because of the ignorance that is in him.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.720]   And that is the whole explanation of the state of the world this morning.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.280]   But now the Christian is a man of whom that is no longer true.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.160]   You are not to be like those people in any respect, says Paul.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   Why?
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.120]   Well, because your minds have been enlightened, you've received this anointing, you've
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.600]   got new life in you.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   You have put off concerning the former conversation the old man.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:19.840]   You've been renewed in the spirit of your mind, says Paul there in Ephesians 4.23.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:26.200]   Very well then, how does all this show itself in actual practice?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.760]   Well, it can be put like this, can't it?
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.600]   A Christian is a man who knows what the truth is.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.880]   You see, our Lord says to this woman of Samaria, "If thou knewest the gift of God and who it
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.760]   is that speaks to thee, but she didn't know."
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.840]   The Christian by definition is one who does know.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.720]   The Christian knows the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.240]   He knows the truth about himself.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:07.480]   The Christian is a man who knows that he is a sinner, a condemned sinner under the wrath
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.760]   of God, one who doesn't deserve anything but punishment and retribution.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.120]   He knows this, sees it quite clearly.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   And he sees this blessed truth that God has provided the way of salvation even in his
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.100]   only begotten Son and that he saves by dying on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.680]   He knows what the truth is.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.440]   He sees this truth.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.400]   He's got a measure of understanding concerning it.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.600]   Now, the point I want to emphasize is this.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.880]   I'm taking it for granted that we're all familiar with these great doctrines of the
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.040]   faith this morning.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.480]   And if any of you are not, I counsel you to come on Sunday night when I shall be preaching
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   more evangelistically and putting these things more plainly.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.360]   If you're in any doubt or trouble about yourself, come Sunday night.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.480]   And then you'll have a gospel direct and plain showing you these things.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.920]   The point I want to establish at the moment is this, that the Christian is a man who not
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:08.600]   only knows these things and sees them, he sees the inevitability of these things.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.820]   Well, I mean this.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.620]   The old difficulties which he used to have about these things have gone.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.440]   And his old opposition to them has gone completely.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.280]   You know what I mean, don't you?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.800]   You've known what it is to stumble at these truths.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.040]   And you are always arguing against them and fighting against them.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.640]   The moment you become a Christian, all that comes to an end.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.200]   Now, I'm not saying that the Christian understands everything.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   Of course he doesn't.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.480]   He's got to grow, he's got to develop.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:47.240]   But what has happened is this, there has been a shift, a change, in his whole position.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.520]   That's the thing that matters.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:55.280]   So that now though he fumbles still and stumbles and still doesn't understand and has got
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.800]   questions, he's on the side of truth.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.440]   He's not against it any longer.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.160]   Before, he was always trying to turn it down, putting his catch questions, watching every
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.000]   word, trying to trick the preacher or anybody, putting the Christian, trying to down it,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   arguments against it.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.880]   He's now in an entirely different position.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.720]   He wants to know, he wants to understand.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.400]   All his sympathies are on this side.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.200]   And when he comes across a difficulty, he doesn't immediately say, "Oh, there's
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   nothing in it after all."
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   No, no.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.640]   He says, "Now I'm defective somewhere here.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.880]   There must be an explanation.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.000]   I don't understand."
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.840]   That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.040]   He's a man who sees the inevitability of these things.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.320]   Now let me give you just one illustration of what I mean.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.880]   Take the great doctrine of the death of Christ, the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.640]   It's a great stumbling block to the unbeliever always.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.280]   The apostle tells us that it was a stumbling block to the Jews and to the Greeks.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.480]   It was foolishness.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.760]   And the modern men, the intellectual, he says in terms of righteousness and of morality
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.080]   that the whole notion is to him quite immoral.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.120]   And thereby, of course, he just tells us that he's not a Christian.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.440]   And he's not a Christian because he doesn't see his own need.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.040]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, his root difficulty with regard to the atonement
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   vanishes completely.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   Why?
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.120]   Well, he is by definition a man who's been enlightened.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.840]   He's come to see that he's a sinner and a heartless sinner and a condemned sinner.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.240]   He can do nothing at all.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.440]   He has some glimmer of understanding of the righteousness and the holiness and the justice
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.120]   of God.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.440]   That no longer troubles him.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.040]   He's not opposed to that he feels that's right and that the glory of God is that he
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.560]   is so essentially different from us, that he is righteous and just and holy and pure.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:57.360]   Well, then the question is, how can such a God forgive such a creature?
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.400]   And here is the answer in the atonement.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   It's a mystery.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   It's wonderful.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   It's amazing.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.800]   He doesn't understand it fully, but he can see now there was no other way.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.720]   There's an inevitability about it.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.480]   The whole position of the man has been changed.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.960]   There is this great shift.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   He's no longer against.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960]   He's in favor of.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   He's on the side of.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.340]   He wants understanding.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.340]   He wants help.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.340]   He doesn't resent it.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.600]   He's not simply there ever trying to turn it down as it were.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:31.520]   Now, this is, you see, what Paul sums up in that extraordinary statement, which I read
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.240]   just now at the end of the second chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.600]   We have the mind of Christ.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.500]   What a statement.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.920]   We used to have the mind of the world.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   We've now got the mind of Christ.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.520]   My dear friends, I'm putting this, therefore, as a general question to you.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.320]   Which side are you on this morning?
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   Which side are you on?
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.160]   Let me put it still more plainly.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.800]   What's your prejudice?
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.320]   Are you prejudiced against this?
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.800]   Are you prejudiced in its favor?
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.080]   What I am saying is that when a man has this new life put into him, this well of water
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.880]   springing up into everlasting life, that his whole disposition, his prejudice, his radical
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:21.680]   position is changed from the one to the other, translated from the kingdom of darkness into
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.280]   the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:32.120]   Therefore as Paul puts it in Romans 8, "They that are after the flesh do mind the things
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.920]   of the flesh, but they that are after the Spirit do mind the things of the Spirit."
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.360]   That's Romans 8, 5.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.240]   What does this word "mind" mean?
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.920]   It means "are interested in, concerned about, delighted."
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   That's the question.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:52.160]   Are these the things that we mind, that we're concerned about and interested in?
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.080]   If it isn't, sir, you're not a Christian.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.440]   Now again I say you can be a very good man, you can be doing a lot of good.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.920]   You want to make the world a better place and you're marching and protesting about
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:06.000]   a thousand and one things, but all I say to you is you're not a Christian.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.160]   The Christian minds these things of the soul and of the Spirit.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.560]   These have the priority in all his program.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:19.200]   This is what controls his entire outlook upon the whole of life.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.280]   And you've either got this or you haven't got it.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.120]   And if you haven't got it, you're not a Christian and you can never produce it.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.440]   It is the water that he has to give.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:38.840]   And all you and I can do is to drink the water and it becomes in us a well of water springing
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.360]   up into everlasting life.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:46.160]   Of course, this is the secret and the explanation of some of those amazing romantic stories
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.760]   that we can read of in the lives of the saints, the profound change that they've undergone.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:57.160]   It's all seen and exemplified to perfection in the Apostle Paul himself, who puts it like
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   this, "I verily thought with myself," he said, "that I should do many things contrary
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.800]   to the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth."
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   That's what he was.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:13.200]   He now becomes the Apostle of Jesus Christ and he glories in him and he desires to know
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.840]   nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:23.000]   What a profound change in the mind, the understanding, in the whole outlook and orientation.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.080]   But let me hurry on.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.880]   There is an equally profound change in the heart.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.080]   It's not only intellectual.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:36.420]   Again, you see, these things are quite inevitable.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.600]   If a man is a Christian, his feelings are bound to be engaged.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   His emotions are bound to be engaged.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.920]   There is no such thing as a theoretical Christian.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.660]   It's a contradiction in terms.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.160]   Why do I say that it's inevitable?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.980]   Well, for this reason.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.680]   If you really believe the things I've been referring to, you cannot remain unmoved.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.420]   It's impossible.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.960]   It's one of those things that just can't happen.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.120]   Of course, you can see these things intellectually and subscribe to them.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.480]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.640]   I'm talking about really believing them, really being governed by them.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:18.760]   So it follows, I say, inevitably, that the man who truly believes these things is moved
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.280]   by them, is moved by the truth.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.920]   Isn't this a note that is lacking?
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:32.720]   It's because it is lacking we tend to produce an artificial joviality so often.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.120]   Try and make, manufacture bright services and so on.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   What a travesty.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.400]   If the truth is in you, the truth will move you.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.720]   God be thanked, says the apostle again in Romans 6, 17, that he were the servants of
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:54.600]   sin but you have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine that was delivered you.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.800]   Of course.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.840]   The Christian is a man who rejoices in the truth.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.160]   He's not reluctantly in it.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.000]   He's not apologetically in it.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.480]   He's not half-heartedly in it.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.160]   It's everything to him.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   This is the biggest thing.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.840]   He's moved by it to the very depth of his being.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.400]   That's why you see, you read the apostle Paul's epistles and you are conscious of
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.200]   this giant intellect addressing you and writing and handling these marvelous periods and this
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.800]   profound logic and demonstration.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.880]   And then he bursts out, he smashes his own grammar, he forgets form and his heart begins
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.840]   to speak and he indulges in some great apostrophe.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   God forbid that I should glory, he says, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:48.720]   He's always talking about glorying and rejoicing and these things.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.160]   This is something again that follows inevitably.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.040]   I'm tempted to put it like this to you.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.240]   Do you come to listen to the exposition of God's word as a matter of duty?
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.360]   You come reluctantly.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   You come half-heartedly or do you come keenly?
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.960]   You come enthusiastically, excitedly, wanting to get more and more of it and rejoicing in
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.680]   it and knowing that there's nothing in the world that's comparable to it.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.280]   The second is the Christian.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.240]   There is nothing that has done so much harm to Christianity as a formal religion.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.680]   Part of the week's program, Sunday morning service, on condition that it isn't too long,
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.000]   doing it as a matter of form, out upon the whole suggestion.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.560]   That's not Christianity at all.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.040]   It doesn't know anything about it.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   That's religion.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   That's the law.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.600]   We are reminded that we are not under law but under grace.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.480]   And this is one of the ways in which you test that.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:51.400]   Is your heart engaged in the sense of your feelings now, your emotions?
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.920]   The apostle John puts this very perfectly.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.840]   In his first epistle he's got a number of tests which he applies to people that they
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.280]   may know whether they're Christians or not.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.380]   And this is one of the best of them.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.580]   His commandments are not grievous.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.600]   If you find the commandments of God grievous, you better examine yourself again.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.080]   But to the Christian, the commandments are not grievous.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.080]   Why?
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   Well, because they're inevitable.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:21.800]   You see, the Christian is a man who's got a love to God and a love to the Savior.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:27.720]   He says, "God so loved the world, he so loved me, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.840]   whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.680]   And believing that his heart is overflowing with praise and gratitude and thanksgiving
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   to God.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   It's inevitable.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.980]   The thing must follow as the night follows the day.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:48.040]   If you believe that God spared not his only Son but delivered him up for us all, how shall
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.240]   he not also with him freely give us all things?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   If you believe that, well, your heart wells up in gratitude and in praise and in thanksgiving.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.920]   And you're filled with a joy.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.240]   Yes, Peter defines the joy for us.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:07.000]   "Whom having not seen," he says, referring to the Lord Jesus Christ, "whom having not
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.600]   seen, you love.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:20.960]   In whom thou now ye see him not yet believing, you rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   of glory."
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   That's the Christian.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:31.000]   He's a man who finds himself bursting out and saying, "Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   gift."
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.400]   Or with Peter, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath begotten
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:43.920]   us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection from the dead," and so on, "of the Lord
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   Jesus Christ."
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   My friends, are your feelings engaged?
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.720]   Are your emotions engaged?
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.200]   Are you moved by the truth that you believe?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.880]   There's a new emotional aspect to the life of a man who's a Christian.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   And unless a man has been moved emotionally by these things, he's not a Christian.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:10.600]   There's nothing so contradictory, again, I would say, of the Christian position as
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:17.040]   for a man to be able to preach about these things without feeling or without emotion,
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.400]   with a kind of detachment, as if he were reading an essay, concerned about the form of his
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.960]   address, rather than the substance and the content.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:32.080]   Ah, the perfection that denies the true Christianity, what a terrible thing it is.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.800]   No, no.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.640]   There is a freedom here.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.480]   There is a joy, there is an abandon.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:45.040]   George Whitefield used to say to ministers always that a man should never preach except
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.600]   he preach a felt Christ.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.480]   Is it possible for a man who preaches the truth about Christ not to feel it?
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   It's impossible.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   No, no.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.560]   Rarely to see him and to know him and to believe him.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.960]   You must feel a felt Christ.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.160]   The feelings are engaged as much as the intellect and the understanding.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.660]   And the same thing, of course, applies to the will.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.600]   And again, note the inevitability.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   It's obvious.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.320]   A man who believes these things is moved by them, wants to do something about them.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.080]   He has a desire within him to obey.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.720]   It results from the understanding and the feeling.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.440]   It's not something theoretical.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.240]   It's not just a point of view.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.920]   It's not something that is imposed upon him.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   No, no.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.760]   He sees the whole thing.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.120]   He can reason like this.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.720]   He says, "Now I believe that Jesus Christ died for me on the cross on Calvary's Hill."
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.920]   Why did he die?
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   Why did he do that?
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.120]   Well, he died that I might be forgiven.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.680]   He died to reconcile me to God.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.960]   But was that all?
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.560]   Has he just provided me with some kind of insurance so that now I can go on sinning
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.160]   as much as I like, knowing that I'm covered by the blood of Christ?
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.960]   That's the very question Paul put in that first verse of Romans 6 that we read at the
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   beginning.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.720]   "Shall we then continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.600]   God forbids us, Paul.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.720]   If you say that, you haven't understood it at all.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   It's impossible.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   "Shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?"
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.840]   Or as he puts it to Titus, "Why did Christ die for us on the cross?"
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:29.040]   He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.240]   a peculiar people zealous of good works.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:40.880]   He died that we might be forgiven, but he died to make us good also.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.640]   His whole object is to destroy the works of the devil, is to produce a people worthy of
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.840]   their Father which is in heaven.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:54.120]   So you see, the moment a man has this new life in him, this well of water within him
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.960]   springing up, he doesn't live the Christian life reluctantly.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.520]   He doesn't object to the commandments as I say.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.000]   That's the whole difference between being religious or moral or ethical on the one hand
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.800]   and being truly Christian.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.440]   The moral man does these things, he does them grimly.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.520]   He forces himself, he has to restrain himself.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.400]   It's a rigid discipline.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   It's a kind of stoicism.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   But you see, the Christian is entirely different.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.280]   His attitude is positive.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.560]   He sees why all these things are happening.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.720]   He desires to be good.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.240]   He wants to please God.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.640]   He wants to show his gratitude.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.760]   This is the change that has taken place in the realm of his will.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.560]   He's all out for it now.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.640]   He's fighting against it.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.080]   He's not living as near as he can to the world just without getting over the border
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   and being punished.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   No, no.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.040]   He wants to be as far away as he can.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.320]   He wants to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.620]   And he's aware of a new ability within him.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.280]   You see, what happens when a man becomes a Christian is that this takes place in his
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.640]   will.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:03.960]   The trouble with the natural man is that his will is in a state of bondage.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.160]   When a man gets this new life, his will is set free.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.720]   This you see is something that is put so plainly by the apostle in his epistle to the Romans.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.280]   Sin, he says, shall not have dominion over you.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   Why not?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.720]   Well, because you are no longer under law, but under grace.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   You see the difference?
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.720]   Sin shan't have dominion over you.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.720]   It used to.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.880]   That's where the bondage of the will comes in.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:38.440]   The natural man is under the bondage and the serfdom of sin and of Satan.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.400]   He's in a state of bondage.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400]   But the Christian is not.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:47.160]   Paul says in Romans 8, 14, "God hath not given us the spirit of bondage again to fear,
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:54.080]   but he has given us the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father, the law of
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:00.440]   the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.'"
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.440]   That's the argument.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.440]   He'd been under the other.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:09.960]   He says in Romans 7, 5, he says, "When we were in the flesh, the motions of sin that
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:15.440]   were by the Lord did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:20.120]   But now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held, that we should
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.960]   serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter."
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:30.640]   And he says exactly the same thing in that great monolithic appeal at the beginning of
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.920]   Romans 12, and watch the word, "Therefore I beseech you, therefore brethren, by the
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.600]   mercies of God, that you present your bodies, a living sacrifice, wholly acceptable unto
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:48.760]   God which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:55.480]   by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.440]   perfect will of God."
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.000]   Very well.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.040]   You see, this is what happens to a man when he receives this new life.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.560]   The whole man is changed.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   The entire personality is changed.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.080]   There's a new disposition.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.320]   It is the disposition that governs the mind, the heart, and the will in every person, every
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.200]   human being.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.360]   In the man who is not a Christian, it is an evil disposition.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:29.080]   And his mind, his heart, and his will are working against God, against his own best
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.120]   interests, governed by the world, the flesh, and the devil.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:41.280]   But the man who drinks of this water receives a new life and a new disposition, gives him
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.040]   a new mind, a new feeling, a new understanding.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.920]   And it's all working in the direction of God and of the soul and of holiness and of
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.160]   heaven and of a joy which is unspeakable and full of joy.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.440]   Have you got this new life in you?
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.360]   Have you got the new disposition?
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:14.840]   Are you essentially different from the man who is not a Christian, the man you once were
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.120]   yourself?
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:27.440]   God give us grace to answer this profound question in the only way that matters, enabling
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:40.800]   us to say, "I am, but by the grace of God, I am what I am."
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
