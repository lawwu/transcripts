[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Good Wednesday morning.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.160]   Well, on Monday we looked at the topic of suffering, namely the divine design behind
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.400]   suffering.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.560]   What is God doing inside of us when trials hit?
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.880]   That was APJ 1852.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.040]   God is the great physician.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.920]   He knows how to use pain in our lives to kill inside of us the sin that robs us of the
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.520]   greatest pleasures, namely enjoying Christ as our greatest treasure.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.240]   That Monday episode was a deep exploration into why suffering is not paradoxical to the
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.420]   joy aims of Christian hedonists.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.520]   As a compliment to that episode, I want to play for you a sermon clip today, one that
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.440]   stands out to me.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.400]   In this clip, Pastor John explains how to prepare for suffering.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.760]   If we're going to suffer well, what groundwork must happen inside of us first?
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.280]   This is a crucial point to be made with principles drawn for Paul's own ministry in Philippians
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.680]   chapter 3 verses 1 to 11.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.160]   Here's Pastor John to explain the text.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.200]   You know this list, don't you?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.720]   He's listing off his distinctives that as an unbeliever, he really enjoyed.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.240]   Surprised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.320]   of Hebrews.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.040]   That's a pedigree, which in the Jewish culture was simply awesome.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   And when you got a good pedigree, you strut your pedigree, you get the praises and you
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.280]   bask in the pleasures of the admiration of being a man with a pedigree.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.080]   Mm, mm.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080]   Feels so good.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.180]   Feels so good.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.180]   This is satisfying.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.720]   I've got a pedigree and people know it.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.640]   That's the unbeliever's satisfaction.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   That's the Paul.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.560]   And then he adds, at the end of verse 5, "I've got three other things that make my life glorious.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:27.380]   I am Pharisee and there are no better law knowers and law keepers than Pharisees and
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.980]   I'm outstanding."
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.820]   It's said in another place, "I have exceeded all of my kinsmen in this."
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.660]   Oh, he had a lot going for him.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.860]   His total reputation.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.220]   And zeal-wise, I took on the church, this renegade sect that's undermining what I've
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.100]   lived for, calling this crucified criminal the Messiah.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   What a blasphemy.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.500]   And I'm taking it on from city to city and bring it down.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.620]   That's who I am.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.900]   That's my identity.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.260]   Has anybody got a zeal?
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.820]   I've got a zeal.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.340]   The rest of you cowards are afraid to take it on.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.380]   I'll take it on.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.780]   Oh, meaning, significance, purpose in life.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.780]   Yes.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.860]   And then he said, with regard to righteousness in the law, blameless.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.380]   I think Paul was by and large free in his conscience.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.640]   I know a lot of people try to say, "Oh, his conscience was killing him all the time because
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   of this and that."
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.060]   I said, "I'm not sure of that."
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.300]   He said, "I was blameless."
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.580]   He was blind, but he was blameless in his eyes.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:11.140]   Now he meets Christ, Acts chapter 9, on the Damascus Road, and suddenly his world collapses.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.840]   He was getting his meaning from a zeal, an allegiance to the law as he understood it,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.400]   a passion for God as he understood it, and at the core of it was the opposite, Jesus,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:42.160]   crucified, pretender, criminal, rightly executed, and people saying, "He's the Messiah."
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.720]   And there he was, alive, with a glory so bright, a greatness so great.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.200]   It blinded Paul, and all he could do was listen, "Why do you persecute me?"
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.640]   And his life was over.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.960]   How at that juncture did he prepare himself to suffer?
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:23.600]   Verse 7, he said, "Whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.880]   for the sake of Christ."
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.720]   That's what he did.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:36.680]   He looked at his life, and all that list, all that pedigree, all those achievements,
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.560]   all that reputation.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.080]   He said, "Now, I will regard that as loss.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.360]   I will regard that as loss."
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:01.280]   In other words, I have now consciously reversed, turned upside down my value system.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.800]   This is how you prepare to suffer.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   You turn upside down your value system.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.480]   So before he was a Christian, he had a ledger, all right?
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.520]   Loss column, profit column, gain, gain-loss, two columns.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:30.800]   Over here in the column of gain, profit was Hebrew of Hebrews, astonishing pedigree.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.360]   Pharisee, zeal, blameless, off the charts.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.320]   What a gain column he had.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.880]   And over here in loss was this horrible opposition and the possibility that Christ Jesus might
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.280]   be the Messiah, and that's not going to happen.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.600]   And then he meets Jesus, and what does he do?
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:04.200]   Takes out a big red pencil, and on this gain column over here, he writes L-O-S-S.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:12.920]   And over here in the Jesus column, G-A-I-N, and everything is reversed in his life.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.560]   Has that happened to you?
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   That's what it means to become a Christian, right?
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.800]   Matthew 13, 44, shortest parable, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who found a treasure
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.040]   hidden in a field.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:36.800]   And in his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, counts it as loss that he might have
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   the treasure."
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.920]   It was just a field before, just walking through a field on his way to his treasure, and he
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.520]   stumbles over King Jesus in glory.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   It's full of diamonds.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's full of gold, full of silver.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.680]   God opened his eyes, and now everything else, loss.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.240]   Then your mind makes that transition.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.920]   Your mind considers it that way.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.560]   That's how you prepare to suffer.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.960]   You get up in the morning, and you consider it that way.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.720]   That's what he says, "I consider, I regard it.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:26.680]   I consciously, mentally am looking at all the goods in my life and regarding them compared
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.040]   to Jesus as loss.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.720]   They're in the loss column, and Jesus is in the gain column."
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.080]   And if you think, "Well, that was just Paul."
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.600]   He says in verse 17, "Brethren, join in imitating me.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.680]   Join in my example."
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.840]   This is normal Christianity, every believer.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:58.680]   Jesus said, Luke 14.33, "No one of you can be my disciple who does not renounce all that
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   he has."
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   Period.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.560]   I'll say it again.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.600]   This is Luke 14.33.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:17.880]   "No one can be my disciple who does not renounce all his possessions."
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.280]   Now you've got clothes on, probably got a car out in the snowy parking lot, might have
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.680]   an apartment or a house, and other possessions.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   You probably have an iPhone or computer.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   So you own things.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:42.040]   And this text says you can't be a follower of Jesus if you don't renounce those.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.960]   Check out different translations on that word.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.440]   Wouldn't that be the same as Paul saying, "Count them as loss."
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.360]   So this is mine, right?
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.960]   I think my wife bought it for me.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   This is mine.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   This coat is mine.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.320]   This is my preaching coat.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.240]   And I should count this as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Jesus.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.080]   As a humorous and simple illustration of a bigger point that we all must learn and embrace
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.320]   to look at our lives and our possessions and our successes and our pedigree and our achievements
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:27.460]   and our reputation and to see all of it as loss compared to knowing Christ.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.200]   That is profound.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.640]   This was from John Piper's sermon titled "Preparing to Know Christ Deeply Through Suffering."
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.760]   It was preached on March 2nd, 2014.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.120]   And of course it is online right now.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.600]   Have a sermon clip to share with us?
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   Send me an email.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.520]   Name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.440]   And make a note of what stands out to you in the clip.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.640]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.720]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.600]   Well Christian unity is important.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.400]   It's really important.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.040]   But Christian unity is not uniformity.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.280]   So if we are not the same in every way, how do we strive for unity with other believers?
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.620]   Three steps.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.400]   Christian unity in three steps.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.200]   Pastor John will explain next time.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   I'm your host Tony Reiki.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.160]   We'll rejoin in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.660]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.660]   [END]
