[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.700]   All right, let's move on here.
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.860]   What do we got for our next question?
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.760]   - Hi, this is kind of random,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.600]   but we actually have another question from Grant
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.860]   who also just moved to DC,
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.020]   but he has a question about specifically
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.720]   establishing KPIs for his career goals.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.520]   - This is a tech guy, isn't it?
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.720]   - He works with Google ads.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.360]   - Yeah, I know the tech guys when I hear them.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.460]   - We'll take a listen.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.940]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Grant.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.660]   I work as a embedded software engineer.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.220]   I'm also very interested in DIY electronics
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.140]   in the maker community.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.380]   In college, it was easy for me to sit down
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.220]   and work on personal projects that involved coding,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.020]   simple PCB and circuit design, et cetera.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.900]   Now, even though I do have mental energy
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.380]   when I end my workday,
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.820]   I find it difficult to sit down and do more coding.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.620]   You briefly mentioned coding as a hobby
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.980]   in your book "Digital Minimalism",
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.820]   but you then go on to describe
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.940]   more traditional offline hobbies
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.980]   to get your mind off of social media and the internet.
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.900]   I've tried some of these things first thing in the morning,
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.220]   but I find it to be a little bit unsustainable,
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.540]   and more than that, this is supposed to be a hobby
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.500]   to take my mind off of things after work
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.380]   so that I don't end up just binging Netflix.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.100]   Is this hobby destined to fall out of my life
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.940]   just because I happen to also do something similar full time
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.980]   or is there a way I can find a happy medium
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.820]   for both personal and professional coding?
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.660]   Thanks.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.300]   - Well, Grant, that's a good question.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.700]   It hits home.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.300]   That's actually a specifically a hobby
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.460]   I'm interested in as well.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.940]   I would like to do more DIY electronics
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.100]   projects and I've actually had a hard time
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.300]   just like you getting this up and running.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.220]   The time just isn't there right now.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.740]   I'm finding I don't quite have the time.
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.180]   I'm not getting the right momentum going.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.580]   I've had computer programming hobbies before.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.700]   So a couple of years ago,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.780]   I used to build computer games for my older boys
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.260]   and I kind of got in a groove on that,
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.340]   computer game programming,
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.460]   even though I was working on computers all day.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.340]   So I've had a hard time getting this up and running.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.980]   I was working on computers all day.
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.900]   So I feel you.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.260]   Because I'm struggling to get the exact same hobby going
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.900]   and not haven't been that successful at it.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.340]   I have four things to suggest that might make this helpful.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.500]   Underscoring everything I'm gonna say here, however,
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.300]   is don't sweat it.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.100]   Like ultimately hobbies are hobbies, right?
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.220]   Like it's not the end of the world
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.740]   that you have this working tomorrow
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.100]   that you have your own channel on tested.com by next week.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.660]   It's a hobby, nothing bad is gonna happen.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.980]   If in the end it's you're busy or you're exhausted
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.940]   or it's not quite clicking and nothing happens, you're fine.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.140]   There's no bonus points for having hobbies.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.780]   It's just, you wanna do things that are interesting.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.060]   You wanna live deep.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.540]   You wanna avoid the shallow distractions.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.820]   Okay, so let's not sweat.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.700]   Like we have to get this hobby up and going right away.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.580]   But here's four things that would help.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.780]   One is project choice.
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.980]   I think that really matters.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.300]   For me, when I struggle with a new hobby,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.780]   it's I don't have the right project that has gripped me.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.820]   And so nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.380]   And the right project grips me
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.420]   and I find myself fighting to make time to work on it.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.900]   I definitely had this experience
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.060]   with the computer game programming projects
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.900]   I would be doing.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   It had to be the right level of difficulty.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.540]   If it was too hard, nothing would happen.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.860]   If it was too easy, I'd be bored.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.980]   But if it was the right level of difficulty,
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.620]   I'd have to force myself to get started.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.940]   But then I would begin to make some progress.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.180]   And then I would find myself putting aside time
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.060]   just to work on it.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.500]   Like looking forward to like,
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.100]   okay, you're putting the kids to bed tonight,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.500]   then I'm gonna go work on the program.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.460]   So it was all about having the right product,
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.500]   the right project.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.540]   Like the last game I did, for example,
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.420]   was I wanted to do a ray casting 3D engine.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.140]   I was using Python and using the PyGames library
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.020]   for some simple low performance graphics, right?
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.300]   And I wanted to make a game where my boys could
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.340]   in 2D create a maze.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.500]   And then you could jump into that maze in 3D
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.060]   and actually try to navigate it.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.740]   So I had to build a 3D engine
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.020]   so you could actually build the maze.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.300]   I was like, let me just do a Wolfenstein 3D style
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.260]   ray casting engine, where you literally are
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.060]   casting rays from the virtual camera location
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.500]   and seeing where it hits walls
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.700]   and how far away that wall is.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.620]   So we can figure out how high to draw
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.900]   that particular piece of the wall.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.620]   There's a lot of geometry, basically.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.500]   Slow, slow, slow until I got that first screen
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.940]   of something is drawing that kind of looks 3D.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.220]   And then I couldn't not work on it.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.660]   So project selection, don't underestimate that.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.780]   That's my issue right now with Maker electronics.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.980]   I don't have the right project with the right equipment
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.540]   where like I know how to do it
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.780]   and I can see progress right away.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.140]   I just don't have the right project yet,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.420]   but I think it's gonna roll quick when I do.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.580]   Two, community.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.940]   Get connected if possible to a community
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.220]   of people who are working on this, that changes a lot.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.100]   There are, I'm sure there's robust Maker communities
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.620]   in the Washington DC area.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.180]   You get involved with some other people
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.500]   that have some equipment, you make it social as well.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.860]   That makes all the difference in the world.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.260]   Start one up and I'll come to it, okay?
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.580]   How about that?
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.300]   You get it going and I will come to it
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.380]   and we'll build some DIY electronics.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.700]   Work less would be my third recommendation.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.540]   So yeah, do less work at work.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.100]   Give yourself some more surplus energy.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.580]   I know that's a bold thing to say in the abstract,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.220]   but here on this podcast, we know how to get that done.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.900]   I mean, we know how to actually apply time management
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.020]   theories that actually are incredibly effective.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.020]   Go back, go to the YouTube channel,
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.580]   watch the core ideas video from the core ideas playlist
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.020]   on time management.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.900]   And I will walk you through the principles
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.980]   of how I organize my time.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.980]   If you're doing those types of things,
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.580]   you can claw back a bunch of time.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.220]   And still, as far as your bosses are concerned,
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   be an incredibly productive person that they can count on.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.700]   Don't be worried about doing that.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.020]   Don't be ashamed about doing that.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.980]   If you get more productive, that is your benefit.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.780]   You know, if right now you're producing work
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.900]   that everyone's happy with, and you find a way to do that
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   in two less hours a day, that is not a problem.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.660]   That is a benefit you should cash in on.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.260]   So consider working less.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.380]   Take some products off your plate
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.140]   and get much more organized about the work you have.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.100]   Free up more energy, more time,
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.940]   so that you have that energy and time
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.860]   to actually work on the project.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.300]   And finally, do the physical first.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.300]   The number one hobby you need to do,
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.140]   and by hobby, I mean activity outside of work,
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.620]   is make sure you have a lot of physical activity.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.700]   You're outside, you're moving, you're exercising,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.620]   you're training for something,
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.300]   just like I was talking about earlier in the show
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.780]   that I'm doing in my own life right now for "The Last Caller".
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.340]   Do that too, because that's a separation
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.900]   between your work and your non-work life,
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.540]   and it's gonna get your energy back up much higher
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.820]   than if you're just coming home from work
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.940]   and sitting on the couch and saying,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.220]   "I guess I should bring out another screen."
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.780]   All right, so those would be the four things
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.420]   I would suggest, but all of this is built
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.420]   on the underlying foundation of don't over-sweat this.
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.500]   If you're really busy right now,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.540]   if you're really tired right now,
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.260]   if you're really mentally struggling with whatever,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.700]   pandemic, et cetera, it's okay.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.660]   It's okay, we'll take our time.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.700]   I'm taking my time, you're taking your time.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.900]   We'll give ourselves a few months,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.700]   but then I wanna be in a really cool maker lab
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.940]   that you ran building cool electronics.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.820]   [Music]
