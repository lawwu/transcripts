[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I love the way that you look at things that we take for granted as operating one way through
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.260]   this different perspective.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.760]   Our mutual friend, Allie Crump, told me the story that at one point she was in a conversation
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.960]   with you and you said, "Well, maybe exercise and all its effects on our health is just
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960]   an epiphenomenon."
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.240]   I mean, could you talk a little bit more about that?
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.100]   I think first of all, I don't think most people are familiar with what epiphenomena are, but
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.180]   this idea of looking at things through a different portal seems so valuable, regardless of what
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.940]   the experimental outcome turned out to be, and perhaps we should touch on that experimental
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.860]   outcome about labor versus non-labor.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.660]   There's so much there, I don't know where to go.
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.500]   I mean, we want to talk about that, the research.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.500]   Let's talk about the study.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.020]   Before we go to the study, though, let's go to the reason for the study, way back when.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.100]   Okay, so there's so many paths I can take here.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.100]   Let's take them all.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.380]   Okay, we'll start with one.
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.060]   So I did some research back in the '70s with people in nursing homes, and why did I do
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.060]   that?
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.300]   Because I had somebody in the family who was in a nursing home, it was very distressing
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.540]   to see people just sitting there doing nothing and barely existing.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.900]   And so we had the idea that if we gave people choices, that might get them more engaged
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.860]   in their living.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.860]   And so we did that.
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.980]   We gave people encouragement to decide where to see people, whether to visit them in your
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.980]   room, in the lounge.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.780]   You have to remember, you can't go into an establishment, a business, and turn the whole
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.540]   power structure around.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.100]   So within reason, we came up with choices people could make.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.820]   We gave them an opportunity to see a movie, you could see it on Tuesday or Thursday.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.060]   We gave them a plant to take care of.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.700]   The comparison group, the tender loving care group, we told them, "People will be visiting
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.100]   you and we'll set it up so you'll be visiting in the lounge."
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   Everything was controlled in that way.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.300]   "You're going to see a movie, and we'll let you know if you're going to see it on Tuesday
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.500]   or Thursday, here's a plant, and the nurses will care for it for you."
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.780]   So we do this.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.420]   We come back, I think it was three weeks, actually, I don't remember, it's been so long.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.900]   18 months later, first we took initial measures, come back 18 months later, those people who
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.660]   were given these choices live longer.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.340]   And that was the beginning of all of my work on health in some sense.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.700]   How could it be that making choices results in a longer life?
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.820]   All right, so what is there about choice making?
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.900]   And then the choices were Mickey Mouse choices, you know, and you always have choice available
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.900]   too.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.900]   You can turn on a light switch.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.340]   You can do it with your right hand, your right hand, your left hand, one finger, three fingers,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.340]   lift your foot, so many choices that you can bring to the table.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.500]   If choice making is good for you, why don't people do this?
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.180]   And that got me more into the mindlessness and mindfulness work now.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.000]   So we have people living longer.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.700]   How can it be that you're making choices, your mind is active, and your body complies?
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.940]   And so then I thought about it, not in one fell swoop, but realized that this whole notion
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.620]   of mind and body, these are just words.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.620]   We come together, here I am, all of me, my fingers, my shoulders, my thoughts, as one
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.620]   thing.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.420]   And if we put the mind and body back together, then the amount of control we have is enormous,
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.420]   right?
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.300]   So wherever I put my mind, I'm also putting my body.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.340]   So in the Mindful Body, which started off as a memoir, I have lots of stories that show
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.420]   the leading up to this idea.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.940]   Let me just tell you two very quickly.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.960]   One was I got married, Andrew, you won't believe it, I was obscenely young.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.180]   And you'll find that if you read the book, I was even younger than admitted, because
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.700]   I was secretly married years before that.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.700]   Okay.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.020]   So I go, I'm 19 years old, I think.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.380]   I go to Paris on my honeymoon, we go into this restaurant, I order a mixed grill.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.060]   One of the foods there was a pancreas.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.380]   My then-husband, who was more sophisticated than I, more worldly, I said, "Which of these
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.380]   is the pancreas?"
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.380]   He says, "That."
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.980]   I said, "So I eat everything, I'm a big eater."
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.500]   Now comes the moment of truth.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.380]   Can I eat the pancreas?
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.420]   Why I thought that being married meant I had to eat the pancreas, I still haven't figured
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.420]   out.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.140]   So anyway, I start eating it, and he starts laughing.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.260]   Not good for newlyweds.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.780]   And I ask him, "Why are you laughing?"
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.700]   He said, "Because that's chicken.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.260]   You ate the pancreas a long time ago."
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.900]   So I made myself sick.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.980]   The other side of that, my mother had breast cancer that had metastasized to her pancreas,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.500]   and then magically it was gone.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.980]   Somehow she had made herself well.
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.700]   So I had many of these sorts of experiences, and talk about, I've been talking about this
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.860]   since, gosh, when did we first, since '79.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.860]   So now people are talking about mind-body connection.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.920]   It's not a connection.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.220]   If you're talking about a connection between two things that says they're separate, and
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.500]   you still have to deal with what's connecting them, and you've put them back together, it's
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.580]   one thing, you don't have to deal with that mediator.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.780]   And so the study you're asking me about, which I'm surprised, I'm having a junior moment
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.620]   that I actually remembered the question you asked, rather than a senior moment, that before
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.300]   I tell you about the study with Allie, the first study we did testing this mind-body
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.500]   unity was a counterclockwise study.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.940]   So here what we did was we took elderly men, we were going to have them live in a retreat
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.620]   that had been retrofitted to 20 years earlier, and had them live there as if they were their
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.940]   younger selves.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.020]   So they talked about things from the past as if they were just unfolding.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.140]   The results were incredible.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.440]   Their vision improved, their hearing improved, their memory, their strength, and they looked
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.300]   noticeably younger.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.980]   So that was very exciting and began all this mind-body unity work.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:56.620]   Now comes the study that you're talking about with Allie, where in a conversation that she
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:04.540]   and I had, she was my student, and she made proclamations about exercise and any proclamation,
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.060]   this is the short answer to your question, anybody proclaims anything, my mind immediately
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.020]   goes, "So when might not that be true?"
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.140]   I'm starting to pick up on that.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.340]   It's a gimmick, I guess.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.220]   It's a gift, is what it is.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:27.520]   So the question was that how important was the understanding of exercise to the effects
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.900]   of exercise?
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.620]   So we take chambermaids, and interestingly, the first question we asked is, "How much
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.540]   exercise do you get?"
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.260]   And they say they don't get very much exercise because to them, exercise is what you do after
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.260]   work.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.100]   It's like a surgeon general who sits behind a desk all day.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.980]   So you would imagine whether they realized they were getting exercise or not, since they're
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.780]   getting so much exercise, that they're going to be healthier than other people who are
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.980]   not getting them, and they weren't.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.980]   That's interesting.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.620]   So now we divide them into two groups, very simple study, randomly divide them into two
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.620]   groups.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.940]   In one group, we simply teach them their work is exercise.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.620]   Making a bed is like working in this machine at the gym, doing the windows, whatever.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:19.700]   So you have two groups, one who thinks their work is exercise, one who doesn't realize.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.580]   We take many, many measures, and they're not eating any differently, one group from the
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.580]   other.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.540]   They're not working any harder.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.300]   Nevertheless, the group that changed their mind and now saw their work as exercise lost
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   weight.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.180]   They made a change in waist to hip ratio, body mass index, and their blood pressure
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.040]   came down.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:48.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
