[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Matt Kaporal from Dawsonville, Georgia writes in, "Pastor John,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480]   I have read several of your books and followed you for a while now.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.500]   I would just like to share with you that this past year at the T4G conference, after you preached,
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.920]   I was able to see you when you went backstage.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.360]   I saw you weeping and the Lord used that greatly in my life.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.040]   It was refreshing to see a man who does not put up a front on stage,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.200]   but a man broken and humble before the Lord backstage.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.880]   Here's my question.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.960]   What is the one thing you would say to a man about to be, for the first time, a father of a son?"
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:51.720]   Well, I'm not sure the connection that Matt sees between tears behind stage
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.440]   and a question about what to say to a father of a new son.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:11.000]   But one does not have to look far to find connections between tears and fathering a son.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.560]   So the way he asked the question triggers the way I'm answering the question.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.760]   Maybe the first thing to say to this dad would be, "Are you ready to weep?"
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.040]   That is, "Are you ready to love?"
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.920]   There is no love in this world without tears.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.060]   None.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.680]   It is a world of sin and sickness and futility and calamity and suffering and death.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.960]   All that will touch your son and yourself through your son.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.240]   Of course, you will laugh and rejoice.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.360]   You will laugh more than you have ever laughed, and he will make you happy.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.000]   But you need little preparation for that, right?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.200]   What you need preparation for is the sorrows.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.360]   He will be sick, and you won't be able to fix it.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.160]   He will have behaviors you cannot comprehend.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.680]   Right across the spectrum from oddities to autism.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.440]   And he can't comprehend them either sometimes.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   He will be rejected by his friends, and he will endure sadness so deep
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.200]   that you'd do anything to lift the darkness for him.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.640]   He will suffer losses, and you will hold him on your shoulder as he heaves with sobs.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.360]   He will lose his job or worse, and you won't have the power to give it back.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.040]   And worst of all, he may lose his faith and lose his respect for his father.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.760]   You will wonder what you have done.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.320]   So my first word to Matt is, "Are you ready to weep?"
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.400]   Because if you're about to have a son, get ready to love and get ready to weep.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.760]   Get a vision of the sovereignty of God and the grace of God that will support you
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.600]   in the saddest times of your life, for that's what family means.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.800]   The happiest and the saddest times of your life are on the way.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.520]   Second, I would say to this new father, "Love God with all your heart and soul and mind and strength.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.880]   Above all, love him with your heart."
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.000]   That is, enjoy knowing God.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.040]   Enjoy belonging to God.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.520]   Enjoy being created and bought and owned by God.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.360]   Enjoy being addressed by God in his word.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.080]   Let your boy see you reveling in the word of God.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.040]   Enjoy being guided by God.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:11.000]   Let the boy see you, you too, are ignorant and need a father to give you counsel in his word.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.840]   Enjoy being strengthened by God and let the boy see you are weak and need a father to help you.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.480]   Let your whole life be full of God and full of glad responses to God.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.760]   And let this son of yours see God in your enjoyment of God.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.920]   Let him see that God has standards how to live, but let him see that it's an easy yoke
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.880]   and it's a light burden as his dad experiences to walk in these standards because of the work
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.440]   of Christ and because of the presence of the Holy Spirit and because of the hope of everlasting joy.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.480]   So out rejoice all those who commend to your son other gods.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.080]   That's number two.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.040]   Number three, I would say to this father, love your wife.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   This boy will learn to be a man by watching you and at the heart of manhood is how a man loves
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:28.600]   his wife. Cherish her obviously, verbally, manifestly with your hands and face and arms
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.280]   and the direction you lean and pull in.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.560]   Lavish her with affection and let him see it.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.400]   Let him see daddy really likes mommy.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.040]   Daddy enjoys mommy.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.960]   Daddy respects mommy.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.040]   Daddy helps mommy.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   Daddy protects mommy.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.280]   Daddy leads mommy.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.320]   Daddy is really happy to have mommy for his wife.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   Don't put on any shows for this kid.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.840]   He will know the difference.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.400]   Really love her.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.360]   Love her.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.400]   Treasure her manifestly.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.840]   Number four, I had two more.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.600]   I would say to this new father of a new son, love the church.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.560]   Love the people of God.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.640]   Speak well of the saints.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.800]   Speak with joyful thankfulness of the history of the saints and the work of the saints and
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   the fellowship of the saints.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   Lift up the heroes of the saints dead and alive.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.120]   Celebrate God's faithfulness in the lives of saints.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.440]   Take your son to church and love doing it.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.880]   When he is tiny, a tiny tot, take him into the worship service.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   Don't send him off to children's church.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.840]   Take him with you and let him see you from the earliest years, three or four years old.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.200]   Let him see you.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.080]   Hold him.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.440]   Let him see you worshiping.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.840]   Let him feel your chest as you sing.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.200]   The mighty fortress is our God.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:21.160]   Let him see you lift your other hand that's not holding him so he can feel your praises.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.400]   Let him see you bow your head in sorrow for your sin and rise triumphant in the assurance
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.920]   of pardon.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.040]   Let him see you hang on the pastor's words and write things down.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.600]   And then when you go home, speak well of the leaders of your church and let him see you
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.040]   love the church.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.160]   And the last thing I would say to this dad is love your enemies.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:54.120]   Let bitterness and anger and murmuring and grumbling be put away from you.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.000]   Pray for those who disagree with you.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.280]   Count others more significant than yourselves, friends and foes.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.040]   Count them as worthy of your service.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   Let your son see you serving the people you don't like.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.360]   Have the mind of Christ who came to serve his enemies.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.320]   And he came a long way down.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.200]   He came to die and to save his enemies.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:28.360]   Let the boy see that it is a glorious thing to love your enemies.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:35.960]   Let him see the difference between a wishy-washy spineless compromise and real love of those
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.720]   you disagree with.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:45.800]   In other words, I would say to this dad, be happy, loving, be a weeping, happy, loving
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.080]   father full of God, full of truth, full of joy.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.800]   Wonderful and sobering.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.160]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those wise words for all of us fathers of sons.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   Out rejoice all of those who are commending your sons other gods.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.680]   That's so good.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.320]   So helpful.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.560]   There's another episode on father's parenting toward joy, which is episode number 255,
