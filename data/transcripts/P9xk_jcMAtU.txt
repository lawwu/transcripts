[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   We're joined one more time by Burke Parsons, who is the editor of Table Talk Magazine,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.040]   the monthly magazine of Ligonier Ministries, and senior pastor of St. Andrew's Chapel
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.600]   in Sanford, Florida, a church founded in 1997 by R.C. Sproul himself.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.040]   R.C., of course, passed into glory 38 weeks ago now, back on December 14th.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.280]   Burke, today I would love for you to share with us the legacy of R.C. on your own ministry,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.980]   and what it's like now for you pastoring without your friend alongside you. Maybe you begin
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.960]   by telling us where you first came in contact with R.C. himself.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:52.120]   I first came across R.C. Sproul and began to sit under his teaching in 1992. I first
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:02.360]   met him, if I'm not mistaken, in 1997, and then began working for him in 1999. Now, before
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.520]   meeting R.C., and it's very important, is in all our lives, we have numerous men and
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960]   women that the Lord has raised up to help us and come alongside and encourage us and
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.320]   mentor us. And I had numerous men from the time I was converted to the time I went on
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.520]   staff of a Baptist church at the age of 19. I had numerous men, not only from the Baptist
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.560]   church, but even from some sort of Pentecostal churches, an independent fundamentalist Baptist
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.480]   church, and then numerous godly men that mentored and shepherded me from the Mennonite church.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.560]   And so not growing up in any one tradition and not growing up really in the church at
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.240]   all, I came in and was immediately surrounded by godly, loving, gracious men that mentored
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.000]   and taught me. And so when I came to hear R.C. and sit under his ministry, I thought,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.680]   you know, this is a guy that I believe. You know, I had begun to listen to a lot of different
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.520]   pastors and preachers and had begun to study and to read. And of course, there are many
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.800]   fine men that God had raised up and has raised up. But there was something about R.C. when
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.400]   I heard him and read him, I thought, I believe this guy. He's the real thing. He doesn't
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.440]   care at the end of the day. He doesn't care at the end of the day if he offends men so
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.040]   long as he honors the Lord. He cares about, he cared about what people thought, of course,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.880]   but he was less concerned about offending men than he was offending God. And so in 1999,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   I went to work under him at Ligonier Ministries. In 2001, went on staff at St. Andrew's Chapel.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.680]   2004, was ordained to the gospel ministry of the pastorate. And really from that point
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.860]   on, we were preaching together and leading worship together and the church continued
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.080]   to grow and the Lord continued to add to our number as we just really, honestly, Tony,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.680]   as we just strive to be faithful to very ordinary things. And what we say is the ordinary means
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   of grace, the word and prayer and baptism in the Lord's supper, not being really a program
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.620]   driven church or an attractional church, really just striving to be faithful to those ordinary
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.160]   means of grace that the Lord has given us and trusting the sovereignty in their use
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.200]   in the church. And so as I began to serve under him, then over the years, what became
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.120]   very strange for me is I began to sort of serve along beside him. And so that was a
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.360]   very strange thing, especially for such a young man, young in ministry, learning to
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   preach, learning a whole host of things about life, growing into adulthood, really, in my
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.920]   twenties of course. And so learning under him, he really became not just a mentor and
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.840]   then in some ways like a father, and Vesta like a mother to me. He really then in time,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.120]   as I got older and as I grew and as we became closer friends, he really became more and
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:19.640]   more of just a buddy. And honestly, Tony, it's been a number of months now, over six
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.400]   months now since RC went to be with the Lord. And I felt that it's just been recently where
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.000]   I've begun to really talk about him because it's like, I didn't just lose a mentor,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.440]   a father, I lost a friend, I lost a buddy. And we would get together throughout the week
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.860]   and we were of course together on Sundays and we were together for lunch on Mondays.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.280]   And that was such an encouraging time because as any pastors listening to this podcast,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.800]   as any pastors know, Mondays are very difficult. The emotional roller coasters that we're on,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.080]   what the devil is trying to do to us and getting us to doubt and getting us to feel the shame
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.840]   and the weight and the burden of everything. Meeting with RC and Vesta on Mondays was really
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   such a great encouragement to me over the many, many years that we did that. And so
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.940]   to your question regarding RC's sort of impact on my ministry and life, I mean, it's so hard
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.360]   to even put into a few words because the truth of the matter is, is that I've been so impacted
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.000]   and influenced by him. And of course, by many others, many other preachers and many other
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.960]   teachers and many other pastors. Sinclair Ferguson has been a long time friend and mentor
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.080]   of mine. And at the end of the day, if I could sort of sum it up and boil it down into just
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:51.260]   a few words, RC's life and his example gave me the picture of a man striving to be faithful
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.220]   with the stewardship that God has entrusted to him, doing what he was gifted to do and
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.100]   called to do by the Holy Spirit, striving to help people and to point people, not to
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:10.900]   himself, but to Jesus Christ, to get eyes off of him and to get eyes on Jesus, to help
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.900]   those that we're serving, those that we're teaching, to get their eyes on the Lord, our
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.580]   holy, gracious, loving and sovereign Lord, to know him and to love him more and more
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.540]   with all their heart, souls, mind and strength, and to love their neighbor as themselves so
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.420]   that people would really feel free, assured as they're resting in the finished work of
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:43.380]   Jesus Christ. You know, it's really very simple. And RC lived that very simple life of a pastor,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.980]   churchman, theologian, striving to work with any that he could at the same time, being
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.200]   willing to draw the line and do what needed to be done to say what needed to be said at
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.240]   times where I believe, and I believe rightly, things needed to be said, where lines needed
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.940]   to be drawn in the sand to say, "This is right. This is biblical." Or even the antithesis,
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.660]   which is much harder to do, to say, "This is not right. This is not biblical. This is
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.980]   not in accord with our confessional standards and with the faith once delivered to the saints."
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:27.500]   But that tension that RC had, or if you will, that balance that RC had of striving to be
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:36.180]   at peace with others, striving to have a unity of spirit and a bond of peace while at the
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.100]   same time contending earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints. That example,
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:49.120]   that legacy of RC's, I think is going to be passed down by the work of the Lord and by
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.980]   the power of the Holy Spirit, not just to me, hopefully, but to thousands and hundreds
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.580]   of thousands of men and women throughout the world.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:05.820]   One of the chief aims of RC in his life, in his ministry, in his preaching and teaching
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:14.140]   was to give God the glory. That God would be the one glorified and not the man, not
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:20.500]   the messenger. That in preaching the word of God and the whole counsel of God in season
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:27.460]   and out of season and not wavering, but remaining steadfast and on course, that the Lord would
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:36.600]   use RC and that the Lord would use all faithful ministers to draw the attention to the Lord.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:45.040]   And so, RC detested this idea, as do I, all this language and all these notions of the
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   celebrity pastor. No good pastor, no faithful pastor likes that or idealizes that. Every
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.480]   faithful pastor wants to get the eyes of all people upon Jesus Christ and not upon himself.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:06.080]   Amen. RC did that and he was a gift and his legacy carries on in men like yourself. Brooke
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.120]   Parsons, thank you so much for your time today.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   Thank you, Tony. It's great to be with you, brother.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.920]   Amen. That was Brooke Parsons, senior pastor of St. Andrew's Chapel in Sanford, Florida,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.680]   editor of Table Talk Monthly Magazine of Ligonier Ministries. And he's on Twitter and he's
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.120]   really good at Twitter too. You should check him out on social media if you haven't. I
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.000]   really appreciate Brooke and am grateful for his time.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.760]   Next week, John Piper is back in the studio with us. And on Monday, he'll talk with us
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.200]   about the five types of biblical promises we can hold onto when depression hits our
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.800]   lives. I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you on Monday. Have a great weekend.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.300]   [END]
