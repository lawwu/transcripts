[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720]   - Hey everyone, and welcome to this special episode
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.720]   of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.560]   It seems right to address some aspects
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.800]   of the current coronavirus pandemic here,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.800]   but as it stands, not a lot of attention
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.360]   will be devoted to it.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.600]   But I think there are a few aspects we need to address
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120]   based on what you, the listeners,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.560]   have emailed us over the past few days.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.440]   But first, Pastor John, I suspect a lot of people
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.160]   just wanna know how you're doing physically in this season,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   and I presume you're spending a lot of time
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.200]   at home right now.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600]   - We are at home a lot.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.040]   (both laughing)
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.080]   Well, who knows?
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.880]   On December 20th, 2006, I thought I was fine,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.000]   and on 2006, December 21, I had cancer.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   So I have no idea how I am, but I feel fine,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.800]   and I don't think we're sick,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.860]   and I don't anticipate getting sick, but the Lord reigns.
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.880]   Worship is different, of course.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.600]   Bethlehem is doing it online.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   So two Sundays ago, we met with a group of 10,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200]   and we sang in the Livingston's basement
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.960]   and watching a video of the service as it went,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.880]   and this time, it was just Noel and me.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.360]   And I'll tell you, if a husband and wife
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.320]   have never sat in two chairs,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.940]   worshiping with their church,
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.940]   and singing alone by themselves, you should try it.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.600]   It will sweeten, it will sweeten.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.440]   If you can get over the embarrassment.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.360]   (both laughing)
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.600]   This is my wife, bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   If you can get over this, then it will be sweet.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.560]   And it was sweet.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560]   So that's been different.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.040]   My treadmill doesn't change.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.900]   It's up in the attic.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.600]   I'm still getting the same kind of exercise.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.360]   I always get, I'm doing all kinds of video conferencing.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.680]   I was on there with T4G today.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.800]   I was on there with a leadership team with you, Tony,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.980]   on the internet doing our Zoom video things.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.880]   I got 60 look at the books done
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.360]   on the first chapter of Ephesians.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.200]   - Amazing.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.640]   - I mean, we're not goofing off here in the meantime.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.480]   - No, there's a lot of work to do.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   - But it is sober.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   I mean, we really, really,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   I desire people be very, very sober-minded about this
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.960]   and not make light of it,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.760]   because I think God is in charge.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.300]   He is saying something.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.200]   We need to ask, what is God saying?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.120]   Because he's in charge.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.560]   He doesn't do things like this willy-nilly.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.280]   He has purposes.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.320]   And so I'm very trustful of him
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.100]   and eager to discern what he wants us to say.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.940]   - Amen.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.480]   So much of the work at DG continues on as normal for us,
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.840]   even in this pandemic.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.300]   Obviously, we can't travel.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.400]   That's the biggest change so far.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.080]   I just finished a string of travel teaching in Frisco, Texas,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.240]   and then in Austin,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.040]   and was in Seattle two weeks ago today
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.600]   as the city was shutting down.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.960]   And I know your big Southeast Asia trip
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.640]   that was planned got canceled in light of all of this.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.560]   - Yeah, that's why I've gotten
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.720]   so much "Look at the Book" done,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.240]   because we just said,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.120]   okay, let's do a deep dive on "Look at the Book"
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.840]   when we should have been in Asia.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.720]   - Well, it's great to hear that you and Noel are healthy.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.560]   Same here.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.380]   The family's healthy,
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.200]   and things seem to be going really well
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.080]   from all outward appearances, at least.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.920]   - Great.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.740]   - Well, as you know,
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.980]   there's an overwhelming sense of fear right now, Pastor John,
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.700]   and we're seeing it in the many emails
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.780]   coming in from listeners in the US now.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.280]   The headlines are ominous.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.080]   The Dow is dropping 1,000 points per day, it seems.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.180]   The consumer market has largely frozen.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.160]   Airlines are slowing and may halt soon.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.700]   And with the stoppages has come the loss of income,
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.060]   and even the loss of jobs.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.420]   We're hearing now from DG Partners,
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.340]   our donors who are faced with new struggles
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.980]   in the marketplace, facing shutdowns,
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.020]   the inability to work as normal,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   and even the harsh reality of now letting go of employees
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.820]   they can't put to work.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.980]   Meanwhile, on TV,
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.140]   politicians are holding live press conferences all day
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.220]   with the latest news, infection stats,
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.700]   and to convince people to stay home.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.020]   Outbreaks of the virus continue to spike in Italy,
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.000]   Spain, Germany,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.300]   but have also moved in much closer to home
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.980]   in states like New York and New Jersey.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.520]   Every state in America now has cases,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.620]   and our hospitals are starting to feel the surge.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.260]   Older citizens know they're in the bullseye of this,
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.980]   and the virus is causing lung failure
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.540]   in a younger demographic than was previously expected.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.740]   It seems like the elderly are stressed,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.780]   adults of all ages are stressed,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.900]   kids are stressed, parents are stressed,
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.700]   business owners are stressed,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.020]   dads who provide are stressed.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.320]   Few of us know if this virus will infect us personally,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.140]   but its ripple effects have really impacted
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140]   every single one of us,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.700]   and now we're being told that this could all last
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.180]   for months.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.140]   So to the many listeners who are fighting for faith
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.180]   right now and fighting against fear right now,
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.100]   whether it's physical or financial,
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   Pastor John, what would you say to them?
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.900]   When I think of the preciousness,
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.540]   the precious experience of being free from fear,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.340]   free from anxiety, full of peace,
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.340]   full of contentment in the face of danger,
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.340]   my question is, who is it that can have a warranted,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.020]   well-founded, justifiable, God-given,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.700]   God-sustained freedom from fear
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.920]   and freedom from anxiety and unshakable peace
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.500]   and sweet, abiding contentment?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   Who can lay a rightful claim to these treasures?
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.940]   It's crystal clear in God's Word
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.900]   that He commands and He offers
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.740]   a life of fearlessness and peace.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.260]   Hebrews 13, 6, "The Lord is my helper.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.340]   I will not fear.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.980]   What can man do to me?"
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   And Philippians 4, 6, "Do not be anxious about anything,
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.820]   but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.780]   with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God,
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.620]   and the peace of God, of God,
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.620]   will surpass all understanding
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.200]   and guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.020]   And Philippians 4, 11, "I have learned
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.060]   in whatever situation I am,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.780]   coronavirus or not, to be content."
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.420]   No fear, no anxiety, supernatural peace,
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.620]   supernatural contentment in every circumstance,
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.660]   horrible or happy, that's what God offers.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.020]   And the question is, to whom is such an amazing,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.260]   supernatural experience of fearlessness and peace given?
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.500]   In other words, I'm not interested, Tony.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.060]   I'm not interested in corona time or any time
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.400]   in the mere psychological experience of fearlessness
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.060]   and contentment that is not based on reality.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.080]   The aim of our lives is not to have
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.620]   a psychological state of mind that is pleasant
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.740]   without reference to reality.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.740]   The aim is to have for ourselves and for others
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.420]   through us psychological, spiritual,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.300]   physical states of happiness
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.060]   that are based on reality, that make much of our maker,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.740]   and that will be true in a million years.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.420]   That's the only kind of fearlessness
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.580]   and contentment I care about.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.500]   So the kind of fearlessness that you see in movies,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.260]   where the cocky heroes keep their cool
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.820]   in dangerous situations and flaunt their boldness,
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.260]   has no interest to me at all, none,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.300]   because it's not based on reality.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.660]   God is real, sin is real, hell is real,
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.440]   Jesus Christ is real, the blood he shed
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.220]   in the crucifixion is real, the Holy Spirit is real,
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.340]   faith and the absence of faith are real,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.940]   heaven is real, the human soul that will exist forever
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.780]   in heaven or in hell is real.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.660]   Those are the great realities of the universe,
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.620]   and none of the fearlessness that you see in the movies
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.080]   is based on any of them.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.460]   Therefore, it's worthless as something to admire
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.180]   or to aspire to.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.020]   What God is doing, among a million other things
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   in the coronavirus, is forcing the issue of reality.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.340]   And one of the litmus tests of whether your life
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.340]   is based on reality or based on the mirage
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.300]   of God ignoring pillars holding up
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.560]   the cultural temple of secularism,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.400]   one of the litmus tests is fear.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.060]   The test of the foundations of your life is fear.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.980]   Oh, what a precious gift God is giving to us
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.900]   to discover while we still have time
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.180]   that the pillars holding up our peace are hollow
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.460]   and made of paper mache.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.100]   That's a gift.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.360]   So I don't want to just start saying
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.740]   when you ask me about fear,
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.060]   fear not everybody, fear not everybody,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.460]   fear not everybody, when for all I know,
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.580]   the people listening to this should fear
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.300]   because the pillars of their lives are paper mache.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.140]   Their lives are not based on reality.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.020]   I don't know.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.540]   I'd sure like to help it not be so.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:45.540]   There are glorious, rock solid, indestructible reasons
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.100]   and warrants and grounds and foundations
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.420]   for not being afraid of what the coronavirus can do
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.760]   to your health or your business or your family
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.600]   or the economy or to Western civilization
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.120]   or to history as we know it.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   There are foundations in reality not to fear any of this.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.420]   So my question is, who is it that can have warranted,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.420]   well-founded, justifiable, God-given, God-sustained freedom
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.480]   from fear and unshakable, sweet, abiding contentment?
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.860]   And the answer is given in one verse,
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.200]   one of the most sweeping, all-encompassing,
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.720]   stabilizing, precious, well-known promises in the Bible,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   namely, we know, we know that for those who love God,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.360]   all things work together for good,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   for those who are called according to His purpose,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.920]   Romans 8:28.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   So who is it that should enjoy the fearlessness and peace
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.460]   that absolutely everything around this coronavirus
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.420]   is working together for their eternal good, everything?
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.460]   And the answer is those who love God
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.380]   and those who are called according to His purpose.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.300]   So here's one of the 10,000 things God is doing
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.260]   through this horrific virus.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.460]   He is saying to the world, He is saying to us
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.100]   what He said to Peter in John 21, 16, "Do you love me?"
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.460]   That's what He's saying.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.960]   And Jesus made it more plain in Matthew 10, 37,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.940]   "Do you love me more than anything, more than these,
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.580]   "more than your mother or father,
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.820]   "child or son or daughter?"
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.480]   And second, He is saying what He said through Peter
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   in 2 Peter 1, 10, "Be diligent to confirm your calling
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.980]   "and your election."
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   The coronavirus is a wake-up question to the world,
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.020]   especially Christians.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:59.020]   Is your life a confirmation that God has called you
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.100]   out of darkness into His marvelous light?
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.100]   These are the people, the called and the lovers of God,
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.600]   these are the people who have a warrant, a ground,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.380]   a foundation in reality not to be afraid,
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.060]   but to be steadied by unshakable peace.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.500]   And Romans 8, the great eight that I think everybody
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.340]   in this isolation period should be memorizing,
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.060]   I'm making that as a suggestion,
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.020]   best thing you could do with your time.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:34.940]   Romans 8 gives greater foundations for this fearlessness
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.300]   than anything in the world, anything the world has to offer.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.060]   I just, I mentioned four.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.060]   Number one, "For the called who love God in Jesus Christ,
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.940]   "all of God's righteous condemnation toward you
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.720]   "was put on Jesus, and there is now no condemnation,
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.700]   "no punishment for those who are in Christ."
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.900]   Verse three, "By sending His own Son in the likeness
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.900]   "of sinful flesh and for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.100]   Condemnation for those who are in Christ is over.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.060]   It happened at Calvary.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.900]   That is wonderful.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.900]   Number two, "God's willingness to sacrifice His only Son
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.080]   "for the called ones who love Him means He not only died
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.800]   "in their place, but will not withhold anything from them
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.340]   "for their eternal good."
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.900]   Verse 32, "He who did not spare His own Son,
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.060]   "but gave Him up for us all,
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.860]   "how will He not with Him graciously give us all things?"
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.740]   So everything we need to glorify God
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.740]   and to have everlasting joy, He guarantees in the cross
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.460]   for us during coronavirus time.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.360]   Number three, "Nobody who is called by God
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.760]   "will fail to attain eternal glory."
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.500]   There is a golden, unbreakable chain of covenant commitment
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.820]   that God will keep His called ones forever.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.340]   Verse 30, "Those whom He predestined, He called,
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.360]   "and those whom He called, He justified,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.740]   "and those whom He justified, He glorified.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:20.180]   "None of the called is lost ever."
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:25.180]   And number four, finally, this means, verses 35, 37,
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.020]   "Neither tribulation, nor distress, nor persecution,
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.120]   "nor famine, nor nakedness, nor danger, nor sword,
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.260]   "nor coronavirus, nor economic collapse,
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.960]   "or total anarchy, or the end of the world
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.220]   "can separate us from the love of Christ."
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.660]   And that includes death, especially death,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.720]   because verse 36 says, "For your sake,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.520]   "we are being killed all day long."
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.420]   And it doesn't matter whether we're being killed
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.180]   by coronavirus or anti-Christian mobs,
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.180]   nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.380]   in all these things, He says,
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.580]   "We are more than conquerors through Him who loved us,
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.640]   "therefore, Christian, therefore, Christian,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.660]   "lover of God, called out of darkness
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.560]   "into His marvelous light, lift up your head,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.120]   "put a song in your mouth, love your neighbor,
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.440]   "and do not be afraid."
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.280]   Those are some rock solid pillars under the Christian life.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.680]   And yes, what a precious gift God is giving to us
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.560]   to discover while we still have time
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.100]   that the pillars holding up our peace
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.740]   are often hollow and made of paper mache.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.580]   Wow, what a word for this season.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.980]   Well, as we mentioned earlier,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.180]   much of our labors at DG continue on as normal,
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.460]   and that includes this podcast, Ask Pastor John.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.220]   And Lord willing, as God sustains us,
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.140]   we'll keep up our regular schedule of episodes
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.080]   on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.740]   and then when we have episodes related to this virus
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.460]   or other unfolding events,
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.260]   we'll release those as bonus episodes in the week.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.220]   So stay tuned for more.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.180]   And thank you for listening.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.380]   Keep sending us your questions.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.540]   Do that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.980]   Thanks for listening and being with us.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.340]   We'll see you next time.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
