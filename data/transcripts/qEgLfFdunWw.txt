[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   So we're seeing this alarming increase in colon cancer in young people, and it's probably due to
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.500]   lots of stuff. I'm sure the food is contributing, but having a large bowel movement about the size
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.760]   of a banana is really protective against colon cancer because it means that you have sufficient
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.280]   fiber in your diet that you're having this really good elimination. And you want it to be a good
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.640]   chocolatey color, like not necessarily a dark chocolate, and you want it to have some form.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.220]   It's okay if it breaks apart. When it falls into the bowl, it should retain its form. It shouldn't
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.180]   then fall apart. And a little on the soft side is good. It's totally normal to see a little flex
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.820]   of fibrous foods. If you had a big kale salad the night before and you see a little bit of green,
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.720]   that's totally normal. If you are having diarrhea and you're seeing undigested food, like rice grains
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.940]   and stuff, that's a problem. That means that maybe you're not digesting the food properly. Maybe you're
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.340]   not absorbing it properly, or maybe the transit time is too fast. It could be any one of those things.
