[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.200]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.960]   For episode number four, I wanted to talk about critical race theory.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.240]   The reason I wanted to talk about this particular subject is because much of the social justice
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.680]   movement today, and even the worldview held by the masses, is seeped in this thinking.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.000]   Most people who have their thoughts shaped by critical race theory, which I'm going to
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.200]   refer to as CRT, don't even realize it.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.880]   And that's why it's so important to bring it to light.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.220]   I am not stating that everyone who advocates for some type of justice reform is a critical
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.220]   race theorist.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.920]   And I'm not saying they should be silenced.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.640]   However, ideologies do the most harm when they are hidden in the midst of unconsciousness
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.440]   because they are working within your worldview and you don't even realize it.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   Therefore, it is important to pin these very slithery ideologies as much as possible so
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.600]   that they can be revealed for what they are.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.040]   If they're helpful, they should remain.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   If they aren't, they should be thrown to the wayside.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.200]   What is interesting and common with many of these ideologies like CRT, and even the term
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.920]   social justice, is that there really is no consensus definition.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.400]   There really is no consensus origin.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.960]   I know because I actually did my research.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.720]   You have to look at the body of evidence concerning these movements, concerning these ideologies,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.600]   and seek out the common denominators to ascertain what these ideologies espouse and then based
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.100]   on that make explicit statements.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.560]   That is why these ideologies are so deceptive and so manipulative.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:46.080]   They could amorphously transform into different ideologies when they fall out of favor.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.440]   CRT sees everything within a power dynamic.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.840]   All human relationships begin and end within a power dynamic.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.720]   There are two groups and everyone is divided into these two groups.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.280]   You are either the oppressor or the oppressed.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.760]   The oppressor is always oppressing the oppressed, so if you belong in that category, even if
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.200]   you're not intentionally oppressing the oppressed, you are doing so.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.560]   The way we determine who is in what category is based largely on categorizations of race,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.960]   gender, sex, sexuality, religion, and even ideology.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.060]   So depending on how many markers you check off the box, that will determine your level
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.820]   of oppression.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.260]   One could simultaneously be in an oppressor category and an oppressed category.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.300]   So there is no exact formula in terms of grouping people.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.120]   Much of it is relative.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.220]   I'll give you an example of being simultaneously in an oppressor category and in an oppressed
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.220]   category.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:20.680]   A white, straight, female atheist is more oppressed than a white, male Christian.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:29.400]   However, the white, straight, female atheist is less oppressed compared to, let's say,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.520]   the brown, straight, female atheist.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.640]   In the example I just gave you, being white is being part of the oppressor category.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.000]   But there are other oppressed categories that the same person fell under.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.040]   Neil Shenvey has outlined four premises within Critical Race Theory, within CRT, that is
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.600]   helpful in understanding CRT as a worldview.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.940]   Neil Shenvey defines worldview as a comprehensive and systematic framework that one uses to
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.680]   view reality.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.780]   A worldview is a comprehensive and systematic framework that one uses to view reality.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.520]   That is a concise definition of worldview that is extremely helpful.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   Now I am quoting Neil Shenvey and dropping his name because I think he is a brilliant
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.280]   anthropologist, just a brilliant mind.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.840]   He has written extensively on this particular topic and others.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:43.360]   He has contributed greatly to advancing and uncovering what Critical Race Theory really
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.060]   is.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.120]   So he gives these four premises and I think if you have the time, you should definitely
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   check them out.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.540]   If you just Google Neil Shenvey, N-E-I-L, space, Shenvey is S-H-E-N-V-I.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.240]   Premise #1.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.840]   Human relationships should be fundamentally understood in terms of power dynamics, which
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.520]   differentiates groups into oppressors and the oppressed.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   That's premise #1.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.640]   Premise #2.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.040]   Our identity as individuals is inseparable from our group identity, especially our categorization
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.360]   as oppressor or oppressed with respect to a particular identity marker.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.720]   Premise #3.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:38.440]   All oppressed groups find their fundamental unity in their common experience of oppression.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.480]   Premise #4.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.440]   The fundamental human project is liberation from all forms of oppression.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:54.200]   Consequently, the fundamental virtue is standing in solidarity against the oppressor.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.840]   There is another term called intersectionality, I've already talked about it without explicitly
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.760]   referring to it, but intersectionality determines whether someone is an oppressor or oppressed.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.280]   And those are the markers, those are the boxes that we check off.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.880]   And those were the race, sex, gender, religion, ideology, sexuality, and more.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:26.200]   So all of this, critical race theory as a worldview, and intersectionality, which tells
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.520]   us which category that we are in, all of this is united within the conversation of moral
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.720]   authority.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:45.440]   The more oppressed you are, the more moral authority you have to speak on categories
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.080]   of right/wrong, justice/injustice.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   Any pushback is going to be stonewalled by stating that the difference of opinion is
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.120]   not rooted in objective fact, but rather the inability of the lived experience.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:18.680]   For example, if a white heterosexual male has a sincere disagreement about policing,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:27.280]   a common retort is a lot of times, "Well, because you're a white heterosexual male,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.640]   that is why you really can't speak on this issue."
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:41.440]   Now, it might be that this white heterosexual male might have grown up in a dense urban
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.000]   area with no white friends.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.080]   Maybe he has all Hispanic friends, or all black friends, or all Asian friends.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:58.080]   But those other factors do not come into play within critical race theory.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:06.280]   What comes into play is merely the intersectionality identity markers.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.080]   So the common retort to this white heterosexual male who has a sincere disagreement about
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.320]   policing would just be, "Well, whatever you say carries no weight by virtue of the
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.840]   fact that you are a white heterosexual male."
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.280]   I'll give you another example.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.760]   Let's say under this worldview.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:36.480]   Let's say you are the son of a rich athlete or celebrity who also happens to be black.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:45.160]   You are then more oppressed than the white male heterosexual who grew up in, let's
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:53.160]   say, a trailer park, born to a single white myth addict mother.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:03.480]   So the son of, let's say, a famous baseball or basketball player who also happens to be
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:13.160]   black would be more oppressed than my buddy who grew up in Detroit, Michigan in a trailer
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.960]   park to a single white myth addict mother.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:29.160]   It is under this framework that we could have even someone like the former first lady, Michelle
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:37.080]   Obama, the former first lady of the United States, it is under this framework that she
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.120]   can say things like, "White people don't see me."
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.400]   And someone like LeBron James who could say that he is oppressed.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.120]   And quoting LeBron James not too long ago, he stated, and I quote, "No matter how much
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.320]   money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.400]   black in America is tough.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:09.460]   We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.440]   equal in America."
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:19.000]   Now I want to say this, I am not saying that Michelle Obama has never experienced racism.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.320]   I'm not saying that.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:27.480]   I am not saying that LeBron James has never experienced oppression.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:34.960]   What I am saying, however, is that the former first lady, Michelle Obama, and LeBron James,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.840]   and I happen to be an avid Lakers fan.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.280]   I've been so since 1988.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.840]   I was eight years old back then.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.640]   I'm dating myself, but I've been so since 1988.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:54.980]   I'm actually quite thankful for LeBron James coming to LA and giving us another championship.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:09.760]   At the very same time, these are two extremely privileged people who are adored by the masses.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.600]   And when Michelle Obama stated in a podcast why people don't see me, and when LeBron James
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:23.720]   talked about how it's hard for him to be black in America, they're not talking about a past
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.600]   episode.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:32.680]   They're talking about within the current state that they are in.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:39.440]   Contrast this with someone like Marcellus Wiley, again, who also happens to be black.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.480]   Marcellus Wiley stated the following on his show, Speak for Yourself.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:50.720]   It's a talk radio show in reference to the organization called Black Lives Matter.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.080]   He stated this, and I quote, "In 2020, white supremacy is the mission."
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.200]   That's a lot of digging through minutia right there.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.560]   I'm on a show that I'm hosting along with another black guy who is hosting with me who
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.440]   replaced another black guy, and that's just one example of it.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.760]   So I understand.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.800]   I respect your space.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:21.340]   I respect what you're protesting for, but will you respect others who do not support
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.800]   that same protest?
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.440]   Marcellus Wiley was also disagreeing with the disruption of the nuclear family that
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.240]   the organization called BLM formally had on their page earlier in the same conversation
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.880]   I just quoted to you.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.840]   In the example of someone who would be considered part of the oppressed category, but doesn't
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:52.240]   toe the line, again, Marcellus Wiley happens to be black, Marcellus Wiley would be typically
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.640]   canceled.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.560]   He would be canceled.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.480]   Another example of this is Ice Cube.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:09.320]   Ice Cube is not someone who is a Republican, or even likes Republicans.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.360]   In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that he hates the Republican Party.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.760]   However, prior to the election, he had offered to work with the Democratic or Republican
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.000]   Party.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   The Democratic Party chose not to work with him, stating that they would reach out to
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:33.660]   him after the 2020 presidential election, while the Republicans worked with him before.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.680]   This came to light later, and when Ice Cube was asked why he was willing to work with
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.120]   Republicans, his simple reply was that he would be willing to work with any party that
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.560]   would be willing to advance the interests of the black community.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:54.260]   After that, if you know, the media began to shun Ice Cube, and Ice Cube was subsequently
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.000]   mocked on SNL.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.960]   If you don't know who Ice Cube is, he is one of the founders of gangster rap, wrote
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:11.040]   songs vilifying the police, and was a vocal critic of the Republican Party, still is.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:20.080]   Ice Cube's only sin was being impartial for one moment in time.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.680]   In my opinion, you're seeing the same phenomenon with Ellen DeGeneres, who happens to be a
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:34.100]   white female lesbian, and one of the first lesbians to come out in Hollywood.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:40.680]   And you're also seeing this with JK Rowling, a white female feminist who just happened
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:47.360]   to draw the line when it came to transgenderism.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:57.000]   So going back to CRT, if the difference of opinion is based on lived experience and the
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.940]   withholding of certain ideologies, you could never question the validity of the other.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:15.880]   Any pushback will be because of the lack of lived experience based on the markers of intersectionality.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:27.280]   A white male could never stop being a white male, a black female could never stop being
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:36.160]   a black female, an Asian male could never stop being an Asian male, and so forth.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:43.440]   The other thing to point out is that in this framework, we are missing the doctrine of
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.000]   the depravity of man.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We're missing that.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.560]   How are we missing that?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.520]   Within CRT, some are oppressed and some are the oppressor.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.040]   Within CRT, some are depraved and some are enlightened.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.420]   If you belong in the oppressor category, there is no forgiveness for you.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:15.800]   There is only going to be continual penance without absolution.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:25.440]   So if you are in the oppressor category, you are depraved.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:32.160]   If you are in the oppressed category, you are not depraved.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:38.640]   And that's where the uniting of moral authority comes in.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:48.920]   And that is why if you belong to the oppressor category, you have no credit to speak on justice
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.880]   or injustice issues.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.660]   This goes beyond weeping with those who weep.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.680]   This goes beyond merely being sympathetic or considerate, which all people should be.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.960]   All people should be.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:17.560]   If you see someone in pain, the idea of being sympathetic towards another's pain is a directive
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.600]   that we should all follow, without a doubt.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:33.320]   My point is, Critical Race Theory goes beyond merely weeping with those who weep.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:41.880]   Critical Race Theory is redefining what we see as objective morality.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.720]   And because under this worldview, under this framework, we are seeking the liberation of
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:57.480]   the oppressed group, methods such as censoring, insulting, and humiliating are acceptable
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.000]   for the greater good.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.400]   This is the same reason why we're afraid to post anything remotely controversial, anything
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.000]   remotely conservative.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.640]   We're even afraid to like such posts.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:25.440]   However, if you belong in the oppressed category, there is room for you to post that and even
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.720]   insult other people who disagree with you.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:36.440]   Now, I'm not saying that people who subscribe to being in the oppressed category have never
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.020]   been insulted.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.600]   That is not what I'm saying.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:52.440]   What I am saying is if you look at the landscape of Hollywood, the media, and social media,
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.680]   that is absolutely true.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:07.280]   Again, it doesn't mean that there aren't wingnuts on "the right."
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:16.680]   It doesn't mean that there aren't wingnuts from "the right" who insult other people.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:27.440]   What I am speaking of, however, is the masses and when it comes to this idea of the silent
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:37.920]   majority, the silent majority, that's where it comes from.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.760]   Being against this worldview, being against critical race theory, it doesn't mean the
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.760]   following.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.600]   I will not deal with this right now.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:56.160]   Being against critical race theory does not mean you believe that racism does not exist.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.280]   Racism clearly exists.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.400]   It doesn't mean that you do not think sexism exists.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.440]   Sexism clearly exists.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:14.120]   The same for misogyny, ageism, and every other ism.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:22.040]   Being against critical race theory doesn't mean I do not believe discrimination in other
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.880]   forms and in every form does not exist.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.760]   Clearly they exist.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:40.360]   It also does not mean that you do not acknowledge the despicable institution of slavery that
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:46.000]   existed in American history or Jim Crow.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.240]   It doesn't mean that you don't acknowledge that.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:57.520]   Clearly they existed, clearly it was despicable, and it was codified.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:08.760]   Being against CRT does not mean that one has to assume everything I stated does not exist.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:17.840]   In fact, under the doctrine of the depravity of man, we are not at all surprised that something
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:24.280]   so sinister could have actually been carried out.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.320]   The Bible states that all have sinned, that all fall short of the glory of God, that all
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.920]   of us are inherently broken.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:41.720]   What I am saying, though, is that that is not the view that critical race theory, that
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.760]   CRT, adopts.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:53.240]   Let me say that again, in CRT, the oppressed are enlightened.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   The oppressed are enlightened, they are not depraved, while the oppressors must become
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.760]   enlightened and are depraved, but they will never truly be.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:14.080]   The oppressors must become allies in order to engage independence, which is activism,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.600]   but they will never receive true absolution.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:28.640]   They can only continue in their penance endlessly in order to merit an acceptance by the oppressed.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:42.040]   Now you can see why this is so inherently dangerous for any society and also the church.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:50.400]   You will never have unity if you constantly assume the worst of another person who looks
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.160]   and thinks differently than you.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:02.040]   If you always assume the worst of a person, they will become the villain, and anything
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:12.880]   they do or everything they say, you will assume the worst, and that is not healthy.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:23.720]   That is not healthy, not only for the beholder, but also for the one that's being perceived.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.640]   I want to park right here, just for a little bit.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:37.000]   I'm hoping to devote an episode on what I'm about to say in the future by doing some book
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.300]   reviews on the subject, by amalgamating what on the surface might seem to be contradictory
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.720]   books but are really not.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:56.920]   I think there are some books out there that will give you a fuller view of not only American
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:04.840]   history in general, but American history as it relates to where we are today.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:11.320]   So if I had to recommend a set of books to you, I would recommend to you Up From Slavery
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:20.000]   by Booker T. Washington, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass by Frederick Douglass,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.580]   and/or My Bondage and My Freedom by Frederick Douglass, Strength to Love by MLK Jr., Letters
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:33.560]   from a Birmingham Jail by MLK Jr., The Color of Law by Richard Rothstein, Intellectuals
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:39.920]   and Race by Thomas Sowell, Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell, Discrimination and Disparities
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.160]   by Thomas Sowell, and White Guilt by Shelby Steele.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:52.360]   There are other books out there, but I think if you do want to do a deep dive into American
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:26:00.280]   history as it relates to some of the issues that we're facing today, that would be my
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.840]   starter pack that I would recommend to you.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:08.200]   To the extent that it matters to you, Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele are both black and
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.160]   as far as I know are not Christian.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:17.320]   Thomas Sowell is probably the greatest economist of our generation, maybe ever, and he is a
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.080]   scholar over at the Hoover Institute at Stanford.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:27.720]   Shelby Steele is also an academician and has written considerably on race issues.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:34.240]   Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass were both former slaves.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:41.440]   Along with this, I would also highly recommend that if possible, you just build relationships
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.000]   with people maybe you normally wouldn't have a relationship with, even if it means being
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.200]   completely outside of your comfort zone.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.360]   People, after all, are not confined to merely books.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   People are not just a collection of facts.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:17.160]   And let me say, seeing people merely as synthetic classifications like race, gender, sexuality,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:22.760]   and the like has been much more harmful than beneficial.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:29.820]   To put it bluntly another way and more specifically, and hopefully this doesn't surprise you,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:36.740]   not all black people think alike, much in the same way that not all white people think
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:42.960]   alike, or all brown people think alike, or all Asian people think alike, or all men think
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.340]   alike, or all women think alike, or all young people think alike, or all old people think
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:55.240]   alike, or insert whatever classification you want to here.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.500]   Black people are not a monolith.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:12.060]   And I know for many it is out of compassion that you want to act and formulate your ideas
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.240]   a certain way.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:21.200]   But be careful that you do not infantilize any group of people or any other synthetic
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.020]   classification of people.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:32.220]   I say this because in some conversations I can tell, again unintentionally, many are
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.620]   using black people and poor people interchangeably.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:47.420]   Now, it's nearly universally out of compassion, but nonetheless the equivocation is many times
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.460]   more harmful than you might see.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:29:02.260]   Just because famous politicians state such derisory ideas does not make it so.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:09.960]   If you do believe that, you've probably never been to Baldwin Hills, Ladera Heights, or
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.100]   Windsor Hills.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:19.680]   Now, circling back, why is this dangerous for the church and society, in particular
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.640]   to the church?
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:32.740]   It's dangerous because it is a worldview that will cause you to literally disobey God's
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.960]   commands.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.320]   And that's the irony of it all.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:46.780]   Out of compassion and a misguided notion to obey God, you end up disobeying God, and many
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:53.920]   times hurting the very people you are trying to help and/or others.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   It's a compassion without knowledge.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.680]   It's a zeal without sound doctrine.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.000]   I want to take some time to illustrate that.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.080]   We are not to bear false witness or report, right?
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.920]   We are not to bear false witness or report.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:20.360]   Christians in particular shouldn't say, "Well, I don't care whose fault it really is.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.800]   I want to be kind and gracious, so I'm just going to blame cops.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.040]   I don't care about the facts."
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.860]   Christians of all people should not be doing that.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:37.920]   But how many times have we heard or seen on social media some form of wanting to stand
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.200]   in solidarity with a group of people?
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:48.300]   So we'll hasten to blast our moral judgments without understanding the totality of what
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:55.880]   actually occurred, thereby contributing to the disinformation going out there.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:04.240]   Somehow we think it is noble to have some sentiment of doing away with objective facts
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.680]   in order to, again, stand in solidarity.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.360]   Don't get me wrong, like I said earlier, we should weep with those who weep, but we do
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.540]   not sacrifice truth in the process.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:25.600]   We should weep with those who weep, but we should not violate God's commands in the process.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.120]   Love rejoices with the truth.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.040]   Exodus 23, 1-2 states this, "You shall not bear a false report.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:39.280]   Do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:46.960]   You shall not follow the masses in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert justice, nor shall you be partial to a poor
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.640]   man in his dispute."
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.240]   Exodus 20, 16, "You shall not bear a false witness against your neighbor."
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:07.020]   So in Exodus 23, 1-2, you are not to bear a false report.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:14.860]   You are not to join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:23.040]   But if you rush to judgment without knowing all the facts, and you're wrong, isn't that
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.160]   exactly what you're doing?
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.560]   Exodus 23, 2, "You shall not follow the masses in doing evil.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.040]   You shall not follow the masses in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.480]   turn aside after a multitude."
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:46.180]   Don't follow the masses, and do not follow the multitude in order to pervert justice.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:57.880]   And that happens digitally, and I understand, for many, it is simply out of compassion.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:09.440]   But in particular, as Christians who have the Word of God, we should not sacrifice truth
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:16.560]   in order to accomplish some perceived noble end.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.720]   "We are not to be partial to the great or to the poor."
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:29.520]   Leviticus 19, 15, "You shall do no injustice in judgment.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:34.980]   You shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   fairly."
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.980]   Let me say that again.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.580]   Leviticus 19, 15, "You shall do no injustice in judgment.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:46.500]   You shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.740]   fairly."
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:54.540]   Imagine how passionate God is concerning partiality, that He would tell us not to even be partial
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.900]   to the poor.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:05.180]   You would think that if there's one group where we could be partial to, it would be
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.660]   to the poor.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:15.500]   But God says in Leviticus 19, 15, that you are not to be partial even to the poor nor
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.100]   defer to the great.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:24.060]   This is echoed in Deuteronomy 1, 16-18, "Then I charge your judges at the time, saying,
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:29.280]   'Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.900]   fellow countrymen, or the alien who is with him.'
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.580]   You shall not show partiality in judgment.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.500]   You shall hear the small and the great alike.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.700]   You shall not fear men, for the judgment is God's.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.660]   The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:51.940]   I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do."
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.820]   We are to judge righteously.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:59.100]   Verse 17, "You shall not show partiality in judgment."
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.380]   Do not show partiality in judgment.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:08.300]   Again in verse 17, "Do not fear man."
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.220]   Leviticus 19, 16 states that we are not to hate our countrymen.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:19.100]   You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you are not to act against
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.340]   the life of your neighbor.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.580]   I am the Lord.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.060]   You are not to go about as a slanderer among your people.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.300]   There's a lot of slandering now, isn't there?
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:35.060]   One half of the country is slandering the other half of the country.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.780]   Because one person thinks differently than you, you slander them.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.020]   Democrats hate Republicans.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.660]   Republicans hate Democrats.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.500]   We hate each other.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:57.700]   So right here in Leviticus 19, 16, God tells us to not go about as a slanderer among your
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.380]   people.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:11.260]   You see how this worldview could cause us, out of compassion, to disobey God's word?
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.260]   Isn't that ironic?
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.620]   I'm going to go on here.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:19.220]   Ezekiel 18, 19-20 says, "The son shall not bear the father's iniquity."
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:25.340]   Ezekiel 18, 19-20, "Yet you say, 'Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father's
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.780]   iniquity?
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.660]   When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all my statutes and done
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.020]   them, he shall surely live.'
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.660]   The person who sins will die.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:41.340]   The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.620]   the punishment for the son's iniquity.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.900]   The righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.460]   will be upon himself."
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.500]   How much of today's talk is exactly that?
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.180]   The son bearing the iniquity of the father?
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.640]   How much of it is based on that?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:11.260]   How much of our hatred within this country is based on what the father did?
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:17.860]   And what's interesting in Ezekiel 18, 19 is that even at that time, the mindset was to
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.900]   blame the father.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:26.780]   In verse 19 it says, "Yet you say, 'Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father's
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.620]   iniquity?
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.180]   Why shouldn't he?'"
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:40.660]   That type of incorrect thinking is exactly what has got a hold of this entire country.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:47.140]   The entire country is saying, and this worldview, CRT, is saying, "The son should bear the punishment
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.780]   for the father's iniquity."
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:56.260]   But God says, "When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:01.380]   all my statutes and done them, he shall surely live."
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:10.540]   So if you're black, white, yellow, red, brown, or whatever other color, whatever other gender,
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:18.420]   whatever else, what other synthetic classification that we group ourselves in, if you have observed
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.980]   all the statutes, he shall surely live.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.940]   The person who sins will die.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:30.900]   That's what God says in Ezekiel 18, verse 20.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.740]   We are also to forgive and love.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.940]   We are also to forgive and love.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:42.540]   Mark 11, 25, "Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone,
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.580]   so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions."
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.300]   Ephesians 4, 32, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.340]   God in Christ has also forgiven you."
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:02.900]   But under this worldview, forgiveness is not high up on the list.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:08.500]   It is not high up on the list.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.980]   What about elements of love?
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.980]   First Corinthians 13, 4-7, "Love is patient, love is kind, and is not jealous.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.380]   Love does not brag, and is not arrogant.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:21.340]   Does not act unbecomingly, does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:31.420]   a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth, bears all things,
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:37.260]   gives all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:42.620]   Are you bearing all things, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:53.660]   if you automatically assume an action taken by another person is due to some evil intent?
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:59.340]   If you automatically assume that, are you practicing love?
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:05.020]   Or are you taking into account a wrong suffered?
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:15.780]   Are we rejoicing with the truth if we say, "Screw the facts"?
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.540]   We're also to pray.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:24.820]   We're also to pray for, love, and evangelize even to the hated in our society, Mark 2,
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:25.820]   15.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.820]   "Notice even that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.740]   and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.600]   For there were many of them, and they were following him."
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.580]   In Christianity, we are not united against another race together.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.340]   We are in fact one people.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:51.820]   Now, keep in mind here, when it talks about the sinners and the tax collectors, they were
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:58.500]   the hated in society, but they actually did commit transgressions.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:04.700]   It's not as if the tax collectors and the sinners were completely innocent and society
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   hated them.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:17.980]   They in fact did commit wrongdoing, but for these people, there was no mechanism of forgiveness.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:28.420]   In the eyes of society at the time, it was okay to hate them and not extend forgiveness.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:35.300]   Are there a group of people in our society that the culture says is okay to hate, and
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.060]   we just go along with it out of pressure to conform?
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:47.780]   I'm going to say something controversial here to make my point.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.100]   If you're a Christian and you're listening to this, and most of you listening to this
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:42:01.900]   are Christian, if not everyone, Derek Chauvin, the cop who put his knee on George Floyd,
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:11.820]   who should be prosecuted for what he did, who should receive justice, and by justice,
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.340]   I mean a guilty conviction.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.340]   He should.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:23.140]   But let me ask you, anyone praying for him?
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.180]   Anyone praying for him?
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:36.700]   According to the Bible, shouldn't we be praying for people like him who committed
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:47.500]   a grievous wrong, who should go through the criminal justice system, who should receive
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:58.140]   a conviction for his crimes, but even someone like him, shouldn't we be praying that he
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:10.940]   comes to know God, that he comes to know our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:16.300]   You know what else illustrates this, and as I'm just kind of speaking into the mic, it
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.660]   comes to mind?
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   Amber Geiger.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.820]   She was the female cop.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:30.380]   Amber Geiger walked in on someone else's apartment, thinking it's her own, shot and
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.180]   killed a black man.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:44.220]   His brother, his brother at the sentencing, told Amber Geiger, who's a white female cop,
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.180]   "I forgive you.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.180]   I forgive you."
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.180]   This was the younger brother.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.380]   "I forgive you.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.980]   I forgive you."
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:00.660]   And then he went and he hugged her.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:09.820]   And people were criticizing him for not continuing to hate on Amber Geiger.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:20.460]   Now if I was the brother, if I were him, and I continued to hate on Amber Geiger, I don't
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.860]   think anyone can blame me.
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.900]   I wouldn't blame him if he just continued to hate on Amber Geiger.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.580]   I wouldn't say, "Oh my gosh, what's wrong with that guy?"
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.460]   I would understand.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:37.220]   I would completely understand having a brother myself.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:52.660]   At the very same time, I am incredibly encouraged, uplifted and fed by that man's actions.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:45:04.380]   And he told her that he was able to forgive because of the power he has in Jesus Christ.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.420]   I was blown away by that.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.940]   I was extremely blown away by that.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:17.460]   And I want to get you his name.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.460]   I have to type it in.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:25.780]   It was Botham Jean was the victim.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:36.160]   And the brother was Brandt Jean, B-R-A-N-T-T, Jean, J-E-A-N.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:43.980]   I was blown away by what Brandt Jean did.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.980]   So I want to say this.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.780]   I want to say this.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:57.060]   Luke 5:32, "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:05.540]   "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:16.940]   Just like the tax collector who couldn't even look up to heaven versus the religious priest
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:23.700]   who inwardly said, "I am so thankful that I am not like the other."
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:32.900]   It was the tax collector who went home justified.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:40.140]   Colossians 1 19-22 says this, "For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:45.860]   to dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:52.100]   the blood of His cross, through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.660]   And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:01.620]   He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:07.700]   Him holy and blameless beyond reproach."
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:14.180]   When we are reconciled to God, we are reconciled to each other.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:20.700]   And it was Daryl Harrison, Virgil Walker, Monique Dusson over at the Center for Biblical
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:26.660]   Unity, Daryl Harrison and Virgil Walker over at the Just Thinking Podcast.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.060]   Races do not reconcile, hearts do.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:38.980]   Races do not reconcile, hearts do.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:46.780]   Colossians 2 8-9 "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.140]   According to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world,
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:55.500]   rather than according to Christ, for in Him all fullness of the deity dwells in bodily
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:02.820]   form, we are not to be captive to godless ideologies.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:08.540]   We are not to be captive to the world's philosophy.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:20.500]   We are not to be captive to every new wind of doctrine or every new phenomenon.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.820]   We are not.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:29.460]   We are not to lose sight of the gospel.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:35.460]   We're not to be in just some state of being.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.420]   We are to magnify the hope of mankind through the gospel.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:47.740]   Our good works should adorn our message and not silence it."
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:56.460]   I bring this up because one thing I've noticed embedded in the secular social justice movement,
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.280]   along with many others, is that it is completely anti-Christ in nature.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:09.700]   If you don't believe me, try going to a rally and sharing the gospel, telling people you're
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.060]   a Christian.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.060]   Try doing that.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.740]   Test to see how well received your message will be.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:25.980]   I'm not sure if you've seen the clip of a group of protesters in DC, but there are a
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:35.500]   group of white BLM protesters who invade a diner, and there are patrons outside of this
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:44.060]   diner, and these white BLM protesters begin shouting in the face of a female patron who
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.340]   is eating outside.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:53.420]   They are trying by force to have her raise her hand in solidarity with them, but she
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:59.880]   is politely refusing to do so, but they're getting pretty violent.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:06.760]   They're not hurting her, but they are shouting at the top of her lungs, surrounding her,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:13.160]   and there are maybe 50 of them surrounding her, shouting at her, where her own voice
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.620]   is being drowned out.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:24.700]   The ironic thing is, a week prior to that, she was marching for their cause, and inexplicably,
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:30.900]   she would later state that even though she agreed with their cause and their ideology,
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.780]   in general, she couldn't bring herself to raise her fist in that moment because she
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.820]   was being forced to.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:43.220]   In that moment, she just knew it was wrong.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:49.660]   So in any case, as she's refusing to raise her fist politely, one of the white female
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:57.700]   BLM protesters shouts in her face, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:04.380]   Let me tell you, that is not coincidental.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:11.060]   That is not coincidental.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:20.860]   If you don't believe me, go ahead to a search engine and you'll find that clip.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:35.940]   Anything, any worldview, any phenomenon that takes you away from Matthew 28, 19 to 20,
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:42.860]   if it takes you away from that, shouldn't it give you some pause?
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:48.500]   Matthew 28, 19 to 20, "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:53.860]   in the name of the Father, the Son, of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.380]   that I commanded you.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:01.980]   And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:11.140]   That was the last thing our Lord stated before He ascended.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:18.620]   Perhaps we should give it its proper weight.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.460]   Perhaps we should give it its proper weight.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.620]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:29.480]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.340]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
