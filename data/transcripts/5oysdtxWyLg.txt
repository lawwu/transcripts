[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Pastor John's new book is about the precious doctrine of God's providence
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   and the title is simply "Providence." God sustains
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and governs over everything that he made, leading all things to their
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   appointed end. And he reveals this remarkable truth
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   to us in thousands of texts in the Bible. It's all over the place.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   By welcoming us into this incredible, revealed reality,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   God calls us to see and savor this for ourselves. He wants
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   us to treasure his providence. He wants us to treasure his providence
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   so much that it brings tangible changes to how we live
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and how we think and how we pray. On Wednesdays, we
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   focus on these implications. We're looking at 10 of them. Last time, in episode 1592,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   we looked at how treasuring God's providence is a spiritual
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and theological vaccination against man-centered theology.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   That was implication number 7, episode 1592.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Today, we turn to prayer. Here with implication number 8
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   is Pastor John to explain. We're talking about
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   the effects or the benefits
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   or blessings of seeing and savoring the providence
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   of God. Even though, in my experience, they are
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   all wonderful, nevertheless, it
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   feels to me that this one that I'm going to talk about
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   right now is one of the most amazing and precious
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and wonderful effects of knowing and loving
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   the all-pervading providence of God.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's this. It gives us
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   the confidence that God has the right
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and the power to answer prayer,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   especially prayer that asks for people's hearts
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and minds to be changed.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   In his New Testament letter, James says, "You do not have
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   because you do not ask. You ask and
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   it on your passions." That's James 4, verse 2.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That means that things really do not
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   happen that would have happened if we
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   had prayed. In other words, God has ordained
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   that we pray, that we ask, and he has
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   ordained that things happen because
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   we ask, precisely because we ask.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Not coincidence, but cause. You don't
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   have because you don't ask. Prayer is one of the great
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   wonders of the world. That God would plan
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   for his own sovereign hand to be moved by the
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   prayers of his creatures is amazing.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   There are mysteries in it, but these mysteries have
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   never stopped the simplest saint or the most highly
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   educated Christian scholar from weaving the
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   thread of prayer into the whole fabric
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   of their lives. As Paul said, "Pray without ceasing."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   There have always been simple folk and highly
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   educated folk who have done this without
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   ceasing kind of weaving and praying in their lives.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Maybe you can tell that I am taking
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   one of the common objections to God's providence and
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   turning it upside down into a wonderful blessing of
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   providence. Maybe you noticed that. The objection says,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   "Well, there's no point in praying since, according
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   to the doctrine of providence, God has all things
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   planned anyway." But just a little thought
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   would show you that God has planned
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   millions of human acts every day
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that cause other acts to
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   happen and without which those other acts would
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   not happen. A carpenter's nail
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   sinks into the board flush because
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   God planned for a hammer to hit it
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   soundly. A student makes an A on a test
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   because God planned for the student to study.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   A jet flies from New York
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   to Los Angeles because God planned for fuel to be
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   available and wings to stay put and
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   engines to thrust and a pilot to know what he's doing.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   In none of these cases do we say
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   that the cause was pointless. The hammer,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   the studying, the fuel, the wing, the engine, the pilot,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   neither is prayer pointless.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It's one of the God-ordained causes
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   of things that God plans to do.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Prayer is part of the plan for
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   how God accomplishes his purposes in the world.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   In fact, the all-embracing, all-pervasive,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   unstoppable providence of God is the
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   only hope for making our most
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   heartfelt prayers effective. Let me say that again.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's our only hope. The providence of God is our only hope
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   for making our most heartfelt prayers
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   effective. If God doesn't have the
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   power and the right and the authority to change
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   things, like people's hearts, what's the point
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   in praying about the things that matter
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   most to us? It's precisely his providence
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   that gives us hope that he has the right to do this.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   What's your greatest longing? What's your most heartfelt
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   desire or prayer? My guess is
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   that for almost all of us it involves
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   somebody's change.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Probably it is the salvation of someone you love.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   At least that's the case for many of us. Or it
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   may be the liberation of your own soul from
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   some sinful bondage. When you pray that
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   God would save your loved one or liberate you
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   from bondage to sin, what are you
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   asking God to do? You are asking him
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to do what he promised to do in the new covenant,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   which Jesus, according to Luke 2220,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   bought, secured, guaranteed with his own
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   blood. Which is, by the way, why we pray all of
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   our prayers in Jesus' name. We pray, God,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   take out of their flesh the heart of stone and give them
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   a heart of flesh, Ezekiel 1119. We pray
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Deuteronomy 30, verse 6, "Lord, circumcise
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   their hearts." Circumcise my heart so
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   that they will love you, so that I will love you.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   We pray Ezekiel 36, 27, "Father, put your
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   spirit within them and cause them to walk in your statutes." We pray
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   2 Timothy 2, 25, "Lord, grant them repentance
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and the knowledge of the truth so that they may escape
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   from the snare of the devil." We pray Acts 16, 14,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   "Father, open their hearts so that they
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   may believe the gospel." The only people
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   who can pray like that consistently
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   are people who believe that saving faith,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   sanctifying faith, transforming faith,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   liberating faith, is a gift, a work
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   of providence. Many people do not believe
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   this. Millions of Americans have been taught
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   not to believe this because they believe that
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   human beings have the power of ultimate
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   self-determination at the point of conversion.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   God doesn't have it; they have it. In other words,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   God can woo sinners like a man
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   woos a fiancé. God can woo
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   sinners, but he cannot create their faith, they say.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Man must have the final, decisive
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   say. They say at the point when
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   faith comes into existence, man, not
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   God, is decisive. I don't
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   believe that. I don't believe that's what the Bible teaches. I believe in the providence
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   of God at that very point and its decisive
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   sovereign power. My point here
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   is that people who believe that false
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   teaching cannot consistently pray
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that God would convert unbelieving sinners.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Why? Because if they pray for divine influence
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   in a sinner's life, they are either praying
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   for an effective influence, a successful
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   influence, which takes away the sinner's
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   ultimate self-determination—not their accountability,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   just their ultimate self-determination—or
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   they are praying for a less-than-effective
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   how should we say it, a non-successful
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   influence, some kind of nudging, but don't take
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   over, God. Don't be decisive. Don't be sovereign.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Just do some wooing, but don't be
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   effective, which of course is not
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   praying for their conversion. So, they
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   must either give up these prayers, these
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   people who pray that way. They must give up praying that
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   God would convert people or give up ultimate human
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   self-determination or go on acting inconsistently,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   which millions do praise God. Many people pray
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   way better than they believe. Prayer is a
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   spectacular gift. No one believed more firmly
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   than Paul that humans do not have the final say
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   in their conversion. We don't. God does. It is
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   all of grace, sovereign grace. He said in Romans 9:16,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   "It depends not on human will or exertion,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   but on God who has mercy." Nevertheless,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   probably no one prayed with
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   more tears and more urgency than Paul
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   for the conversion of sinners.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   "I have great sorrow and unceasing
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   anguish in my heart," he said, "for the sake of my
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   brothers, my kinsmen, according to the flesh. My heart's desire
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and prayer to God for them is that they may
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   be saved." That was Romans 9,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   2, and 10, 1.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   He prayed this way because he knew
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   that the new birth is not a mere decision
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   of humans, but a miracle from God.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   "With man this is impossible," Jesus
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   said, "but with God all things are possible," Matthew 19,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   26. So my conclusion is
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   the all-embracing providence of God does not make
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   prayer a problem. It makes prayer powerful.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It makes prayer the wonderful gift
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   that it is. Oh, let us be
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   a praying people.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Amen. What a great call. God's providence gives us the confidence that God
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   has the right and the power to answer prayer.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   That is so, so relevant and so important. Thank you for listening to the podcast.

[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   We are going to end the week with one of the most perplexing
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   questions in all of the Bible. If he knew, if he knew that he
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   would betray him in the end, why did Jesus choose
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Judas as a disciple to begin with?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   It's a great question. We get it all the time. We're finally going to address it. I'm your host, Tony
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Rehnke, and we'll see you back here on Friday for that.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   [end]
