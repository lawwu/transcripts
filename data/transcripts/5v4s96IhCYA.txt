[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Pastor John, what role does our church family play and our Christian friends
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.000]   play around us in the continuation of our faith and us preserving to the end?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.500]   Tony, just yesterday I was reading in 1 John on my way through the Bible,
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.500]   and I've often said that eternal security is a community project
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.500]   rather than something that's individualistic, merely and automatic.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500]   God uses means to keep us eternally for himself.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500]   It's not like a vaccination against hell.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.500]   It's more like a committed therapist who unfailingly--this is God unfailingly seeing to it--
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.500]   that we hold to the health regimen that brings us to everlasting glory.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500]   I totally believe in eternal security.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.500]   Jesus said, "I give them eternal life. They will never perish.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.500]   No one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father is great.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500]   No one can snatch them out of my Father's hand."
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.500]   But I've also said that this keeping, this divine keeping,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   is a community project in which God uses people.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   "Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   because we have come to share in Christ if we hold our original confidence firm to the end."
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   So our exhorting one another every day is one of the instruments,
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500]   one of the means by which God keeps us in Christ to the end of time.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   Yesterday in 1 John, here's what I read, and I saw that it's in a totally fresh way.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   1 John 5:16, "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin, not leading to death,
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   he shall ask, and God will give him life."
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   So I had never paused to think, "You mean the life that we need to make it to the end,
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   the eternal life, is given when I see a brother sinning,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   and I pause and I ask God, 'Oh God, bring him to repentance,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   bring him to the point of confession,'
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   and God will use that prayer as a means of preserving that person's eternal life."
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   So there is a kind of sinning that shows God has given a person over to depravity.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   John tells us that. There is sinning that is unto death.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   It's like Esau's sin in Hebrews 12, 17.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   He sought repentance and he couldn't find it, even though he sought it with tears,
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   which is a fearful prospect that we could ever sin so long God would just give us up.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   But 1 John is mainly devoted to helping us see that there is sin that is not unto death.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   We write these things to you that you may not sin, but if anyone does sin, we have an advocate.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   That's 2 John 2, or if we confess our sins, he's faithful and just and will forgive our sins.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   So John is so eager to help Christians not despair that if they sin,
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   they are proving themselves to be unregenerate.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   And what I hadn't noticed before in 1 John is that God says one of the means
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   by which he will preserve us in Christ is when we pray for each other.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he'll ask and God will give him life.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   So eternal life is sure for the bride of Christ and for those who are called and justified.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   But it's not automatic like a vaccination.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   It involves exhortations from Hebrews 3 and it involves prayers like this one in 1 John 5, 16.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   And then just as I was pondering that, the Lord brought to mind James 5, 20,
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   where it says, "Let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death."
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   And I thought, "Okay, how do you bring back a sinner from wandering?"
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   And you do it at least in those two ways, don't you?
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   Hebrews 3, exhort him and 1 John 5, 16, pray for him and the Lord will give him life.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   So here's the personal impact it had on me.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   I'm out here in the middle of nowhere in Tennessee and that's a scary place to be, isn't it?
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   Because this says, in essence, don't separate yourselves from the very people
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   who could be the means of your life, be the means of your preservation.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   So I just hope that everyone who's listening to this won't leave the fellowship of believers.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   They'll keep themselves grafted into believers who can pray for them,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   that they won't lose their life, and who will exhort them to hold true to the end,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   and that they'll do that for others.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   And I hope people will pray for me, that God will reveal to me any sins that I may have in my family
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   or in relationships that if I spot them, I could repent of them, get forgiveness for them,
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   and thus be preserved.
