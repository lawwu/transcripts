[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:11.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:22.200]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.720]   the show where we get questions straight from you,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.600]   the viewer, and even some feedback
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.520]   that we're gonna go over today.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.280]   Ask the Compound show at gmail.com,
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.520]   that's your email here.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.160]   Today's show is sponsored by Fabric by Gerber Life.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.800]   Fabric by Gerber Life was designed by parents for parents,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.480]   I'm a parent so I can understand,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.440]   to help you get a high quality, surprisingly affordable
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.240]   term of life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.760]   We're gonna talk term of life at some point
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.720]   in Ask the Compound in an upcoming episode,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.120]   I think at the end of this month.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.740]   So they say go start to cover it in less than 10 minutes,
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.320]   no health exam required, thousands of parents use it,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.500]   you protect your family.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500]   It's fabric.com/atc, sorry, meetfabric.com/atc.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.100]   I checked it out, it's great.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.900]   You just put in your age, male, female, what's date,
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.220]   do you use tobacco, how's your health?
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.640]   It's funny, you watch early 90s movies
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.940]   and everyone's smoking, it doesn't happen anymore, right?
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.020]   It's almost weird to see someone smoking.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.980]   - In Europe there's still a lot of smoking.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.860]   - I can see that.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460]   So, policy is issued by Western Southern Life
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.540]   insurance company, not available in certain states,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.260]   prices are subject to underwriting and health questions,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.300]   but this is the kind of thing that,
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.980]   especially if you're a parent, you have to check that box.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.140]   My wife is a constant worrier, I'm not the worrier.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.140]   She does, so she makes sure this kind of stuff
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.020]   is taken care of.
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.980]   I'm gonna have to introduce her to fabric, pretty cool.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.580]   - Mr. Spreadsheet is not the worrier, interesting.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.500]   - It is kind of funny, yeah.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.020]   I'm more of a things will work out kind of guy.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.500]   My wife is a worrier, so we balance each other out.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.420]   All right, Duncan, last week we talked to trucks, right?
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.660]   And I got some good feedback from people.
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.580]   A lot of people actually who are truck drivers
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.420]   drew to me.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.580]   Daniel, throw the first one up here.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.540]   We got a good feedback here.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.300]   32 year old truck guy here, he says,
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.100]   "This is exactly why I waited 10 plus years
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.540]   "to buy my dream truck.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.640]   "I waited until dividend income could cover the payment."
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.300]   That's even further than I went.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.960]   "Also made sure he had a cash flowing business
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.020]   "to run with the truck."
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.580]   So he's using the truck for a business,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.100]   not just driving it because it looks nice.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.180]   He said he definitely advised the same to younger people.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.620]   That's all I was saying last week,
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.380]   is that just wait a little bit, right?
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.500]   Wait till you can actually cover it.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.180]   I don't care if you drive a big truck,
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.980]   just make sure you can afford it.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.340]   - When I met a lot of truck people
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.700]   totally agree with what we were saying.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.580]   I mean, it can't be more annoying
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.500]   to have someone who actually needs a truck
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.960]   to have to pay more for a truck
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.300]   because a bunch of people want them for vanity sake.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.220]   - Yes, I had another one say,
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.820]   "Listen, I drove junky old trucks my entire career
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.040]   "and that allowed me to retire early
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.360]   "'cause I wasn't paying for the newest top of the line one."
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.200]   I think it makes sense.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.180]   One more piece of feedback.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.060]   Daniel, throw the next one up.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.280]   This is someone coming to Duncan's defense.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.160]   He says, "We all have our Oatleys in our portfolio
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.380]   "and the guys give Duncan a decent amount of grief for it.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.060]   "I want to know what their Oatleys are, past or present."
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.300]   Fair question.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.140]   We do.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.460]   I also told you to watch the first 10 minutes of Curb,
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.820]   your enthusiasm, the new one.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.100]   Did you see what Larry David did?
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.920]   - I saw, I saw.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.780]   - He switched from what, soy milk to, or almond milk?
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.980]   - Almond milk to oat milk, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.700]   - All right, see, you've been waiting for it.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.900]   - It's a sign. - It's coming into,
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.500]   it's a sign.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.180]   I got a couple of easy ones here.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.060]   The easiest one for me,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.420]   and I think it's a good lesson too in understanding,
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.340]   you can be totally right on the thesis
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.500]   and still get wrong on the stock price.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.020]   So the one for me today that finally round-tripped for me
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.420]   for the first time since 2019 is Disney.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.820]   My whole thesis was Disney+ is going to be huge,
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.320]   and I said that because I have kids.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.780]   And it was a grand slam in terms of,
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.180]   they got way more subscribers
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.300]   than they ever thought imaginable,
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.780]   but they lost so much money that it didn't matter.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.800]   And so I looked today, I think I bought it in 2019.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.720]   Since 2019, Disney is essentially flat,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.660]   which after today, Disney's up nice.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.600]   It's back to break even for me, basically.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.260]   And the S&P's up like 105% of that time.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.020]   So it's not that I was down,
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.220]   just that I was down 30% at one point or something.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.440]   It's the opportunity cost that the market itself
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.140]   just totally left it behind.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.020]   - See, this is why I wish they'd bring back shareholder perks.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.980]   You know, it wouldn't feel so bad
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.820]   if you got like a little discount at Disney
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.140]   or on Disney items or Disney+.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.180]   - Give me a free lightning lane.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.660]   - Yeah, there you go, yeah.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.480]   - Something like that.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   The other one for me was Zillow.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.580]   I was bullish on the U.S. housing market,
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.940]   and I have been for years.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.260]   And after 2021, Zillow fell like 30%,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.140]   and I'm like, oh, perfect timing.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.060]   I'm gonna get in on this.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.660]   I'm bullish on the housing market.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.500]   I bought in Zillow,
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.820]   and it fell like another 60% from there or something.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.780]   - That one's a little bad for you.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.980]   - I'm still way underwater on that.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.260]   I've been buying more,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.060]   'cause I'm still positive on home ownership
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.160]   because of young people.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.340]   But that one didn't work out too well for me.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.620]   See, so yeah, those are my recent Oatleys.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.520]   Is that fair?
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.580]   - Yeah, and I mean, it's all about
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.140]   when you get into a stock, right?
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.840]   I mean, you mentioned recently,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.100]   Oatley's up a bunch over the last couple of months.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.060]   If you've been holding it since the IPO like me,
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.340]   then things aren't great.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   But yeah, it's all about when you're in.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.260]   - Just cut off that first part of the holding period.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.780]   All right, let's get into questions.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.180]   - Okay.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.400]   Up first today, we have a question from YouTube.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.420]   - Yes, this was a YouTube question from last week.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.940]   I think I pulled it right from the comments.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.560]   - Okay, let me see where we are here.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.740]   Okay, so actually, I don't have it pulled up here.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.100]   - All right, just read it. - I'm just gonna read it.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.540]   Okay, "Investing at all-time highs is counterintuitive.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.840]   "Does it produce great returns
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.500]   "because the market is forward-looking
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.400]   "and investors are momentum investors?
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.740]   "It doesn't seem to make sense to buy
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.720]   "just before a long, severe bear market."
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.980]   - All right, so I understand the worry here.
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.240]   The worry is, it's scary that we're back at all-time highs
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.940]   because literally every crash in history
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.860]   has started from all-time highs.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.660]   So that means it's going to happen again.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.700]   And we heard the same thing in 2013 when that happened.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.100]   And I get it, it's been two years or so
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.540]   since we've had all-time highs.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.140]   We already actually hit, if we do it today,
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.580]   it'll be nine all-time highs.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.620]   Otherwise, through the close on Wednesday,
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.240]   we've had eight all-time highs this year alone already.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.820]   So my point is, the thing you have to understand
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.720]   about markets is they're always and forever cyclical.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.940]   And sometimes those cycles turn on a dime,
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.460]   but most of the time, they tend to go longer
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.900]   than you can think in either direction.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.660]   The pendulum swings from one side to the other way too far.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.060]   And the reason for this is because humans
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.020]   control the markets.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.500]   And when things are going really well or really crappy,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.180]   our emotions tend to get the best of us.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.580]   And so that's why volatility
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.940]   tends to cluster during downturns.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.580]   I've talked about this before on this show.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.700]   But new all-time highs tend to cluster during upturns.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.260]   So Daniel, give us a chart on,
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.940]   this is S&P 500 all-time highs since 1950 in chart form.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.740]   And you can see the blue is just the price.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.840]   And then those little green dots on there,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.980]   which I had Sean, a research guy, put in for us,
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.900]   is all-time highs.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.740]   And look at how they cluster.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.660]   It's very rare that you see one all-time high
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.500]   and then a crash.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.540]   The only time it really happened was in 2007.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.220]   I think it was like nine all-time highs.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.080]   The dot-com crash happened, stocks fell 50%,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.900]   worked our way back from the bottom in 2003
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.740]   back up to 2007, and then you had the peak
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.540]   that led into the great financial crisis.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.180]   But since 1950, you can do a chart off, Daniel,
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.700]   there have been all-time highs on 6.7% of all trading days.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.580]   But during bull markets, those percentages are higher.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.500]   So in the '90s, it was 12% of all trading days.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.340]   And it took from 1929 to 1954 to take out those highs.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.020]   It was forever from the Great Depression.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.460]   But if you start from 1954 through the rest of that decade
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.500]   when it was a huge bull market,
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.260]   it was one out of every 10 trading days.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.700]   From 2013 to 2019, it was 14% of all trading days
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.540]   that you hit an all-time high.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.580]   So these things tend to cluster around each other, right?
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.540]   The new all-time highs tend to lead to new all-time highs.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.500]   I know it seems scary, 'cause one of those
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.140]   is going to be the one that gets you.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.900]   But most of the time, it's fine.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.460]   And obviously, no guarantees with this stuff.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.460]   But new all-time highs are actually relatively bullish.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.140]   Daniel, next chart on, this is from J.P. Morgan.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.860]   J.P. Morgan did a study where they found
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.180]   if you had invested on any random day,
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.340]   going back to 1988, throw a dart at the board, pick a day,
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.340]   your average return one year later would have been
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.020]   roughly 12%, a little less than 12%.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.660]   But had you invested just on the days
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.500]   when the stock market hit all-time highs,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.660]   one year later, your returns were nearly 15%.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.780]   And they were higher three and five years later as well
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.660]   on a total return basis, investing dividends,
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.300]   which is totally counterintuitive to people.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.020]   The average returns are better from all-time highs.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.180]   - Yeah, I can't wrap my head around that math,
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.620]   how that works.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.380]   - Because bull markets tend to last longer
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.500]   than bear markets, that's the whole thing, right?
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.140]   And so, I think the reason these results
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.820]   are so counterintuitive is because,
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.860]   I think it's just like behaviorally based.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.180]   And so, like the research, I can take
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.460]   all the Daniel Kahneman behavioral biases.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.020]   So the research shows investors hold on
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.300]   to losing stocks too long and hopes
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.220]   they're gonna come back, right?
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.420]   This is Oatly for you, Disney for me, Zillow for me.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.140]   But people also sell winners too soon, right?
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.660]   Oh God, I got a huge return in a month.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.460]   So we also anchor to recent results, right?
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.740]   There's this anchoring bias.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.820]   So people underreact initially to news.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.460]   And then once that news becomes more apparent,
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.460]   then they overreact.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.300]   That's why I think, that's why the pendulum swings
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.420]   to the upside and the downside,
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.860]   because people tend to overreact.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.220]   So you add in all the fear, the greed,
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.580]   the overconfidence, the confirmation bias,
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.580]   all this stuff, this is what causes it.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.380]   And that's why these trends tend to persist
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.260]   longer than people think,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.900]   and why this stuff tends to cluster together.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.100]   The good times tend to go on
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.300]   for a little longer than you'd think.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.940]   The bad times tend to go a little lower than you think.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.940]   So, and the simple explanation too,
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.200]   is just that, guess what?
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.860]   The stock market goes up most of the time, right?
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.700]   Three out of every four years,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.700]   on average, the stock market is up.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.060]   So that's why all-time highs
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.620]   are actually perfectly normal.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.580]   If you're a long-term investor,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.060]   you're gonna see plenty of all-time highs
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.900]   throughout your career.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.260]   There's gonna be times where there's gonna be breaks.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.900]   Again, we had two-plus years
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.340]   between time for an all-time high.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.820]   But, you know, a handful of new all-time highs
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.660]   will lead to a crash.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.740]   Most of them will lead to more highs.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.580]   - The market usually goes up,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.100]   but how many single stocks end up going down or going away?
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.340]   It's a lot, right?
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.160]   - It's a lot, more than--
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.000]   - We've talked about before.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.840]   - Well, yes.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.680]   - Right, yeah.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.160]   So yeah, that's why it's like,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.020]   don't do drugs and don't pick individual stocks.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.620]   - Well, that's the thing.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.500]   This works for the stock market as a whole.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.460]   This does not necessarily work
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.620]   for individual stocks themselves.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.660]   - Right, yeah.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.300]   - All right, next question.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.180]   - Hey, up next we have a question from, who is this?
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.380]   Brian.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.840]   I'm in my mid-30s and married
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.460]   with a second child on the way.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.440]   My wife is quitting her job at the end of the year
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.180]   to be a stay-at-home mom for the foreseeable future.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.500]   We max out our Roths, get the max 401(k) match,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.540]   put a couple hundred towards a 529 each month,
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.460]   send money to support my mom, and put the rest in savings.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.100]   We've saved $125,000 in a high-yield savings account
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.500]   as a sort of emergency fund
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.500]   or future house/vacation, car, et cetera fund.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.060]   Savings have mostly come from my wife's income
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.860]   and we live off of my income.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.460]   When we transition to a single income,
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.900]   should we save as much as we do now
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.120]   and just reduce our discretionary expenses,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.100]   or should we maintain our current spending
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.900]   and save nothing for the time being?
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.940]   The thought is that maybe we make up some ground
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.900]   in the future with promotions and raises,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.280]   or if my wife goes back to work.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.540]   - All right, great question.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.380]   - This doesn't sound like it has to be
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.500]   in either or, though, right?
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.340]   That's my first--
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.460]   - No, so the way that I see it, though,
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.340]   if you don't have a grandparent willing to step up,
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.420]   and Brian is sending money to his mother,
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.500]   so maybe his mother will pay him back a little bit
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.980]   if she lives close by and help pick up the childcare,
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.740]   but you basically have two choices.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.900]   You pay up for daycare, and daycare's really expensive,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.780]   as I mentioned on the show before, right?
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.860]   I said that it's pretty close to paying for college
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.060]   without having 18 years to save for college,
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.780]   and number two is you have one of the parents stop working,
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.380]   so one of the ways, you're either shelling out money
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.780]   or you're making less money,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.500]   unless you have someone who's willing to help
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.340]   or you have a really flexible work schedule, right?
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.940]   So we had three at one time for a couple of years in daycare
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.220]   and it was just brutal, but here's the thing.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.260]   That situation is temporary, right?
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.700]   And we knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.060]   so for a couple of years there,
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.620]   we had to rein in our savings a little bit,
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.340]   but I knew that light at the end of the tunnel,
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.020]   all three kids going into public school
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.340]   was probably the biggest raise I've ever got in my career,
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.760]   because that line item was off of the book,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.160]   so I realized, yeah, we're gonna have to cut back
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.420]   for a couple of years because the kids are in daycare,
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.260]   but then once they go to school,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.440]   then that money, you can make it back up.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.180]   So I would say, see how it goes in terms of cutting back.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.760]   It's probably gonna be hard to cut back with two kids,
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.140]   'cause kids can be expensive.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.860]   Everyone always talks about how expensive they are.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.940]   One of the things is you don't spend
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.400]   as much money on yourself, but yeah,
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.460]   having two young kids is gonna be expensive.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.420]   The diapers and the wipes and all that stuff,
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   and clothes, and it's a lot.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.100]   But it sounds to me like Brian and his wife
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.700]   are way ahead of the game in terms of saving already.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.220]   They have a 125K bank,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.460]   they've been maxing out their retirement accounts.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.400]   The way that I did it is I actually saved enough money
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.420]   to pay for the first full year of daycare
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.260]   when our twins were coming,
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.500]   because I did not wanna have to deal with that
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.840]   hanging over our heads.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.800]   So it was there, it was taken care of,
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.980]   we didn't have to alter anything,
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.820]   and then we had to alter things
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.860]   down the line a little bit.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.740]   So Brian's already shown the ability to save.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.580]   Maybe his savings takes--
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.260]   - Can you use a 529 for daycare?
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.900]   - Would be nice, wouldn't it?
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.220]   So maybe his savings takes a hit for a couple years
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.460]   while his wife's home with the kids,
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.320]   but I don't know, the personal finance side of your brain
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.220]   is gonna go, "No, no, no, we can't do this."
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.580]   But I don't know, that sounds like
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.860]   a pretty rational trade-off to me.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.000]   Two young kids at home.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.100]   Once the kids are a little older,
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.620]   maybe your wife can go back to work,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.260]   or as you said, you might be getting raises
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.420]   and making more money, your income's higher
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.260]   and you can save more.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.460]   So I think you'd probably do the catch-up thing.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.940]   Your financial life would be way easier
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.020]   if everything worked linearly.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.380]   Easier said than done.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.420]   That if everything worked in a straight line,
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.600]   you could save the same amount every year,
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.780]   but sometimes you're gonna have to cut back.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.820]   Life events get in the way.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.740]   It's happened to me before.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.020]   You buy a house, you remodel your basement,
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.540]   you have something like this come into play,
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.080]   you have a wedding, whatever it is.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.500]   Making more money certainly helps,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.180]   but having an expiration date in your childcare expenses
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.100]   and maybe your wife going back to work, that's okay.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.820]   And also, it's okay to change your financial plan.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.220]   I think that's where I kind of fall on this.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.980]   'Cause it's gonna be temporary.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.060]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.260]   Sounds like good advice.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.300]   - All right, next question.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.900]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Eric.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.540]   We moved to Florida from New Jersey in 2011.
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.500]   In 13 years, we've only had $8,000 in claims
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.820]   on our home insurance.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.780]   In the past four years alone, our rates have tripled.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.740]   Our auto insurance has doubled.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.580]   We love living here, great weather,
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.700]   good schools, beaches, et cetera.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.860]   But what are we supposed to do?
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.980]   Self-insure, move somewhere else,
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.620]   suck it up and pay the higher rates?
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.700]   - Okay, so this is some feedback we got from Animal Spirits
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.200]   because Michael and I have been talking about this,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.780]   that the highest home insurance premiums
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.020]   in the country are Florida.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.460]   I think they said the annual average is like $9,200, right?
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.380]   And the number was, I think, something like 15 to 20%
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.460]   of people in Florida are choosing
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.340]   to forego paying insurance.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.480]   And we actually got some good feedback on this
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.420]   from a colleague of ours.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.140]   Bill Duke, he actually wrote a blog post at the Bell Curve.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.380]   Bring Blair in here.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.860]   - Hey, guys. - Hey, Blair.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.700]   - You checked with Michael and I,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.380]   you said, "I wanna do some feedback on this,"
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.340]   'cause you had a lot of thoughts.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.180]   And it's interesting 'cause the feedback we heard
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.780]   from people was, first was, tell them to suck it up
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.140]   and just do it, it is what it is.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.800]   You're taking a risk by living in an area like this.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.920]   And some of the people were saying,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.940]   "No, I would take the risk and not pay the insurance."
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.940]   So you live in New Orleans, which is a place
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.540]   that had some natural disaster in the past.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.220]   So where do you fall on this?
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.200]   'Cause some people say,
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.780]   "I could never go without home insurance.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.460]   "It would just scare the daylights out of me.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.460]   "I can't even imagine."
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.580]   Other people are more willing.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.140]   - Yeah, so I feel the pain from this question
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.220]   because Louisiana must be number two
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.340]   in the nation for homeowners insurance rates.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.140]   We've also seen a tripling of rates in the last few years.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.500]   And there's reason to believe that hurricanes,
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.620]   at least, are still cyclical.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.700]   So there might be some relief coming up soon.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.940]   So if we wanna pull up a chart
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.700]   of the most costliest hurricane seasons in history,
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.340]   three of the top 10 were 2020, 2021, and 2022, right?
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.980]   So three in a row was really tough
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.180]   for the overall insurance market.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.940]   Insurance companies buy reinsurance,
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.400]   which is insurance that kicks in
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.080]   after they hit certain amounts.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.200]   And the reinsurance market was really tapped out.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.820]   So that's a lot of the pressures we're seeing.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.540]   Then we had the double whammy of,
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.900]   it costs more because of recent inflation, right?
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.980]   It costs more to buy the materials to replace the house,
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.360]   and it costs more for labor.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.080]   So double whammy with insurance.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.300]   We had a really bad string of bad storms.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.360]   2023 was a year where we got a little bit of reprieve.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.020]   So there may be some more insurers
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.060]   that can come into the market.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.300]   At the end of the day, though,
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.060]   the market is telling us something.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.540]   It's expensive to live in these areas.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.740]   And so you really have basically four choices as I see it.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.920]   Suck it up and pay the higher rates.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.860]   You can sell your house and try to rent
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.460]   and see if you can push some of those costs
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.900]   off to the landlord.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.260]   You can move away.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.660]   And it's hard to imagine for people
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.020]   who don't live in these areas what it's like.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.760]   They say, "Oh, that's just easy to live somewhere else."
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.860]   But that's not what we wanna do for the most part.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.500]   You could self-insure, but most people cannot self-insure.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.700]   The bank is not gonna let you self-insure
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.620]   if you have a mortgage.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.900]   They need protection for that mortgage loan.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.460]   - Yeah, so you gave an example in your post
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.520]   about someone who decided to forego the insurance.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.400]   Why don't you tell us how that one worked out
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.920]   and what the thought process was.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.760]   - Exactly.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.360]   The other thing is you can't self-insure
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.440]   if your home equity is part of your financial plan
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.040]   because you have to be willing to lose
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.120]   some of that equity to self-insure in a total loss.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.920]   So I was at an event in New Orleans.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.040]   I met an elderly woman.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.080]   She's been in her home for over 40 years.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.440]   There's no mortgage.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.280]   The amount of money that she paid for her home
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.720]   is way below what it's worth.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.920]   It's below even lot value, okay?
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.000]   So she's on a fixed income.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.520]   Her insurance on this $300,000, $400,000 house
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.240]   was jacked up to $9,000 or $10,000 a year.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.900]   She just doesn't have the money to pay for it
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.040]   and she's willing to accept that risk.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.480]   She's gonna pocket that money
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.660]   that she would put in insurance in a savings account
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.360]   or an investment account.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.200]   Hopefully she'll have many years
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.860]   or maybe never have a claim,
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.120]   but hopefully she'll bank some savings.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.440]   If she does have some damage from a storm,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.200]   she'll be able to pay for it.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.700]   And in a total loss situation,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.400]   she is willing to walk away and sell the lot
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.920]   and move somewhere else.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.600]   And that's a risk that she's willing to take
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.220]   in order to stay in her home.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.080]   But again, she doesn't have a mortgage.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.920]   She doesn't have huge,
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.600]   she didn't have a lot of money that she paid for the house.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.840]   The house value is not predicated
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.860]   on success of her financial plan.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.520]   Very, very few people fall into that category.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.080]   So it is an option in some cases,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.800]   but you have to be willing to take that risk
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.920]   and you have to be financially able to take that risk.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.080]   So otherwise, yeah.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.840]   - And maybe do something to those savings.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.920]   Like the point, especially if you have a really old house,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.120]   I can see it making more sense
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.040]   and your mortgage is paid off
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.320]   because then the land is probably worth
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.920]   more than the house anyway.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.400]   - Or at least enough to recoup
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.880]   what you paid for the house, right?
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.520]   So it all depends.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.940]   You've got to run your own numbers.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.120]   Most people are not gonna be able to self-insure,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.600]   but there really are instances where it might make sense
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.200]   because if you're insuring for the 100-year plan,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.840]   your insurance should be about 1%
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.720]   of the fair market value of your home.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.100]   If it's running higher than that,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.200]   which it is in a lot of areas,
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.040]   if you don't have a mortgage and you can take a loss,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.200]   you might wanna consider it.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.480]   Most people are not in that situation.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.280]   - So Michael in the chat here says he's also from New Orleans
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.000]   and he said that his insurance is more than his mortgage now.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.520]   - I could see how that's the case.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.120]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.280]   It's wild and it's mind-blowing to people
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.360]   who don't live in these areas,
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.380]   but that's the reality we deal with.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.560]   Unfortunately, the market is telling us something.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.720]   These weather events, whether it's fires, floods, storms,
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.880]   it looks like they're gonna be here to stay.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.280]   And so you also have to think long-term.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.400]   We think about this as well.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.560]   We definitely wanna raise our kids
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.720]   through high school in New Orleans,
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.520]   but we may not be long-term owners
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.120]   of expensive property in New Orleans, just saying.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.860]   - Is it worth it to shop around at all
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.440]   or are the rates pretty similar anywhere you go?
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.680]   - I got to a situation where I'm on the insurer
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.360]   of last resort through the state
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.800]   because I have an old slate roof.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   So in some cases, insurers are dropping out of the market.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.580]   You don't even have any alternatives.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.720]   The one caveat is if you can get in,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.160]   USAA actually still has fair rates,
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.680]   but of course you have to qualify to be a member.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.520]   - Okay.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.440]   - I think the scariest part of this to me is yeah,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.280]   what, you know, insurance, they've done their research.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.580]   They, so they're kind of telling you
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.480]   if they're not willing to insure or they're charging a lot,
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.320]   that's a little scary, right?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.860]   - Yeah, they're pretty good at weighing the risks, right?
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.840]   They run the numbers.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.000]   - Yeah, so.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.040]   - Yeah, interesting.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   All right, let's do another question.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.240]   - Okay, up next we have my mother passed away
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.920]   and each of my brothers will get $300,000 to $400,000
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.240]   from the estate.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.120]   Sorry for your loss, just to start off here.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.600]   My brother is 35 single and has a good job
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   making 75,000 Canadian dollars, but it's not permanent.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.980]   He has $5,000 in retirement savings
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.380]   and previously worked in restaurants
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.520]   making 40 to 50 K a year.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.000]   He has a rent controlled unit at about $1,100 a month.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.160]   I worry about his financial security,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.000]   but to his credit the past few years,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.320]   he's been investing and eliminating debt.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.680]   He could buy into a co-op or older condo
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.120]   for $200,000 to $400,000 and not have a mortgage,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.620]   been saved for retirement.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.320]   This would essentially eliminate any concern
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.840]   with unemployment, homelessness, or retirement.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.860]   All he would have to worry about is maintenance.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.800]   Or he could stay where he is, rent,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.120]   and have a very good nest egg for retirement.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.040]   What do you think he should do?
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.760]   - All right, so a lot of stuff going on in this one.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.600]   We've had clients like this in the past
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.160]   who have come into money, if parents pass away,
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.600]   and then it ends up being one of the siblings
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.800]   kind of ends up being the person overseeing everything.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.880]   So how do you think about this in terms of
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.720]   not only managing this money for yourself,
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.760]   but managing money for someone else potentially
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.040]   and trying to help them,
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.560]   especially if their financial habits
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.780]   aren't in the best shape?
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.600]   So how do you think about even starting
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   to help someone in that situation?
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.720]   - Yeah, the concept of sudden money,
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.960]   which is what we have here, right?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.240]   Sudden big chunk of money that's coming to you
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.440]   through an unfortunate event,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.300]   a family member has passed away.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.240]   People tend to not make the greatest decisions
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.440]   when faced with this.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.200]   I am personally not a fan of putting a huge chunk of money
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.980]   into real estate versus investing it,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.880]   because I just ran quick numbers.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.320]   If you invested 300,000, he's 35,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.060]   let's say he works until the retirement age of 65,
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.400]   just at a 6% return, it's gonna be over $1.7 million.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.520]   And buying a condo or a co-op doesn't solve the problem
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.480]   of joblessness or homelessness.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.460]   It still costs money to own property.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.460]   You have to pay the taxes,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.100]   the insurance that we just talked about,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.060]   there's upkeep.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.840]   So that's not gonna necessarily solve the problem.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.120]   - You lose your liquidity, yeah.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.000]   - Exactly.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.120]   So I would be more of a fan of invested for the long term,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.720]   use it to supplement some of the problems
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.680]   that might come along.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   But at the end of the day,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.460]   I think he's gonna be way better off
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.140]   by investing this money than spending it
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.920]   on something like a property or any other thing
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.380]   that you might be tempted, of course,
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.920]   to spend sudden money on.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.600]   - How helpful is something like a financial advisor
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   in this case, where it's someone who's coming
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.800]   into this new money to help provide some guardrails?
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.760]   - If willing, a financial advisor can be great,
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.120]   but all we can do is lead the horse to water.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   We can't make them drink.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.240]   So you have to be truly willing to accept that advice.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.120]   And if the financial advisor is the thing
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.320]   that's gonna help keep you accountable, absolutely.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.860]   - Yeah, and I've even seen cases
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.340]   where there's a trust involved or something
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.860]   where they kind of dole out the money more slowly
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.060]   and it acts as almost an income stream
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.740]   and it's invested as opposed to just having
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.860]   this big pool of money, like you said,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.740]   that can be really tempting to do something with right away
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.940]   and you blow it and then what?
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.780]   - Exactly.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.180]   Most people do this on the front end
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.780]   if they have children and grandchildren
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.500]   that they know they're gonna leave large sums of money to.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.180]   They go ahead and title that in a trust
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.940]   or a trust that comes from their will.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.320]   It's giving you, the person who's passing on the money
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.800]   to your heirs, control past the grave, essentially,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.360]   and helping them with guidance, putting a trustee in place
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.600]   and rules and parameters as to when
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   and where the money can be spent and how.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   That's great estate planning 101 basics for anybody.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.080]   It looks like it's too late for this one,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.160]   but at the end of the day, it's a good thing
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.040]   to have a financial windfall.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.680]   And if treated properly, this could really set him up,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.240]   even with no additional savings.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.180]   We're talking about almost $1.8 million
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.100]   at a pretty conservative 6% rate of return in 30 years.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.700]   - Yeah, I'd say rule number one here is do no harm.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.300]   Just don't screw it up.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.140]   - Exactly.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.580]   - That's how I look at it.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.420]   All right, one more question.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.260]   - It sounds like they're pretty concerned
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.580]   about their sibling here.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.140]   Is this kind of like the airplane thing?
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.860]   You've got to secure your own oxygen mask
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.580]   before taking care of other people?
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.100]   Is that the way you have to kind of think about this stuff?
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.220]   - Certainly, you have to look out for yourself first.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.980]   Family dynamics are really tough,
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.360]   especially when people are dying and passing away,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.240]   and there's complications around money.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.520]   It's a whole topic.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.580]   There have been books written about this.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.760]   It happens in lots of families.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.980]   I feel for them.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.440]   At the end of the day, you can't do something
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.360]   for your sibling that they're not gonna do for themselves.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.360]   So as much as you want to help,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.600]   you're gonna have to let them stand on their own two feet.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.960]   - And some people don't like to be lectured to,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.980]   even if they are bad with their finances.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.320]   So it's a tricky situation if you're almost policing them.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.980]   It's kind of, you're walking a fine line.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.480]   - Yeah, don't let money ruin your relationship either.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.320]   - Right.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.140]   - Good advice.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:27.320]   Okay, up next, we have kind of a tone shift from that one.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.120]   We have Jack writing in, starting off with,
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.240]   my wife, in parentheses, Borat voice.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.320]   - You have to do it, Duncan.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.800]   - My wife, I can't do it.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.640]   Is it okay to imitate a made-up comedy character?
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   - I think that's fair.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.860]   - Okay.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.320]   Anyway, so my wife and I recently--
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.600]   - I didn't know we were still doing Borat jokes,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.520]   but not bad.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.040]   - No, I mean, classic, right?
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:50.880]   It's a classic.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.720]   - That's true.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.320]   - My wife and I recently married.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.200]   We have steady government jobs that we expect to keep
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.760]   for the foreseeable future.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.560]   Our combined annual income is 180K.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.160]   Naturally, we're thinking about buying a house.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.480]   I like how he says naturally,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.040]   because it's true, everyone is trying to buy a house.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.000]   - Yeah, that's the next step.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.160]   - We want to continue to live in the college town
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.840]   where we've been for a few years, but housing is limited.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.800]   Someone at a local credit union told us
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.900]   the median home price was $850,000,
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.500]   and they put in parentheses,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.500]   "Honestly, I thought it would be higher,"
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.680]   which is out of our price range,
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.980]   unless Oatly stock makes a run pretty soon.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:31.020]   I conservatively expect to put up a down payment of 125,000,
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.860]   but I'm worried it's still not enough.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.120]   I'm considering borrowing about $7,000
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.280]   against my retirement plan through the state,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.300]   but there are pros and cons for sure.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.480]   Dan, next slide.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.660]   On the one hand, this account will have time
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.900]   to grow for 30 more years,
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.780]   but a loan at 9% variable interest over 15 years
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.380]   sounds painful if it won't make that much of a difference
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.220]   in the down payment.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.660]   Am I missing something?
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.180]   We're better off than most people our age,
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.400]   but I still fear we're gonna miss the last helicopter
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.660]   out of Saigon boat if rates go down
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.140]   and we're crowded out of the market.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.340]   They have a way with words.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.260]   - Yeah, this is a well thought out email.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.660]   So actually, this is from Jack,
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.900]   and Jack wrote us in and said,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.480]   "Hey, I thought you were gonna use my question.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.640]   "I decided not to borrow against a 457."
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.640]   So they already are having, you know,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   six figures in a down payment.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   I think people overestimate the amount they need
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.160]   for a down payment sometimes.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.080]   I think a lot of it depends on the bank you're working with,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.520]   but even if they got up to 850,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.200]   which he said might be too high for them,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.920]   that's what a 15% down payment for 125.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.160]   That seems plenty to me.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.360]   People don't, unless the bank is forcing you
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.520]   to come up with the money
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.760]   because you have a poor credit score or something,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   you don't have to go to 20%, right?
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.160]   What do you think about coming up with smaller down?
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.880]   I think my first house, I did a 5% down payment.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.920]   - Yeah, I think it's more about the income
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.200]   to debt payment ratios here
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.160]   than the down payment necessarily.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.740]   There are different loan programs,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.600]   depending on the age of the house
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.280]   and all different down payments that are available,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.640]   but I just ran some quick numbers
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.320]   and I'm trying to figure out which college town you're in.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.120]   I don't think it's Palo Alto or Berkeley.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   I think that's a little higher,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.480]   but it's certainly not Tuscaloosa or Athens, Georgia.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   So I'm just trying to figure out
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.320]   where the median home price--
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.160]   - A little cheaper in the South, huh?
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.920]   It could be Ann Arbor, it's pretty expensive there.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.280]   - It might be, yeah, you're right.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.240]   So if we're looking at the median purchase price of 850,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.320]   and I put some numbers together on a very simple spreadsheet
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.280]   and a down payment of 175,
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.060]   that means you're borrowing 675 to buy the house.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.200]   I looked up 30-year mortgage rates yesterday,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.120]   6.375 was the rate that I was seeing.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.240]   That means your monthly principal and interest payment
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.360]   on the note is gonna be just under $4,200.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.520]   Now, you're gonna have to do these numbers yourself.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.080]   I don't know what your insurance rates are,
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.640]   I don't know what your taxes are.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.000]   I used one half of 1% annualized on insurance, 1% on taxes.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.560]   That gives you a total monthly payment
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.280]   to be in the house of just over $5,200.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.800]   If we look at your income,
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.160]   and you said you have steady jobs, steady government jobs,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.200]   gross monthly pay here, if you're making 180,000,
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.560]   is 15,000 a month.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.200]   I don't know what your effective tax rate is,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.960]   so you're gonna have to go in and do some work here.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.440]   But let's just say it's 20%,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.040]   and your net pay is $12,000 a year.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.640]   If you're just looking at the mortgage note
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.820]   for this 850 house, you're a little over
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.760]   what we use as a rule of thumb,
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.380]   which is housing shouldn't be more than a third
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.040]   of your take-home pay.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.960]   But when you add in insurance and property tax,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.020]   you're way over the line.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.000]   So I think it's more about the purchase price of the house,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.220]   especially if 175 is a stretch for you on a down payment.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.440]   Because you don't want 43% of your take-home pay
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.160]   going towards just living in the house.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.440]   - That's pushing it pretty high as far as the budget goes.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.400]   - Exactly.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.700]   So I ran another scenario.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.280]   What if your house price is a little lower?
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.860]   And I think I'd use 650 if we wanna put that up, Dan,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.160]   with the same down payment.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.800]   And that's gonna be a much higher percentage down payment,
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.120]   same mortgage rate.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   Your monthly payment drops total in this analysis
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.440]   to about 4,100.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.580]   And if we look at that compared to your net take-home pay,
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.120]   your numbers are a little more in line.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.040]   That was a $700,000, sorry.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.320]   Your numbers are a little more in line.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.680]   Even with your property tax and insurance,
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.860]   you're close to that third.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.100]   Government jobs are stable,
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.160]   but you're probably not gonna get huge raises.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   But over time, I think you would grow
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.440]   into a house like this.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.340]   So that's kind of the way I would think about it,
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.040]   more so than how much of a down payment you can put down.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.520]   - Yeah, and I do wonder if the bank likes
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.480]   that more stable government income as well,
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.940]   where that will be kind of helpful
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.400]   for getting a loan as well.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.360]   - They just want you to have those W-2s in place, honestly.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.920]   They just wanna prove the income.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.880]   They're gonna be willing to lend you way more money
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.440]   than those numbers I just showed you.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.080]   They will lend you up to 38% of your gross income.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.480]   So don't take the maximum loan that the banks will allow.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.680]   - I feel like everyone does that, though.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.640]   They give you a range,
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.600]   and everyone always says the highest, whatever it is,
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.760]   that's where we're going.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.840]   - Yeah. - That's our range.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.080]   - I like that this is all kind of in the hands of Ovaly,
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.560]   you know, based on what they said here.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.240]   I like, I like-- - It's a lot of pressure
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.080]   on you, Duncan. - I like depending
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.480]   on what I stock. - And roll the dice.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.360]   - And someone in the chat did say,
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.620]   like, listen, the reason a lot of people
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.280]   do wanna put 20% down,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.560]   and we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show,
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.080]   it's a private mortgage insurance.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.240]   If you don't put 20% down, you have to pay that.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.480]   I did look at the process. - I hear a lot of people
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.600]   very afraid of that.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.820]   Like, a lot of people - It's low.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.020]   - find that as a deal breaker. - Yeah, it's not very much.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.400]   - It's like $100 a month.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.720]   It's not a lot of money.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.420]   - Yeah, it's not terrible. - If you put down, yeah.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.080]   It's not terrible.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.640]   And then you can grow out of it,
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.420]   and you don't necessarily have to pay off
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.120]   the full whatever percent,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.200]   because your home price will appreciate over time,
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.720]   so you can get a new appraisal.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.760]   So I would not be afraid of private mortgage insurance.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.120]   - Yeah. - But on the other hand,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.920]   you should be buying a house that you're gonna live in
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.800]   for the foreseeable future,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.560]   because you don't wanna put 5% down,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.760]   need to sell it in three years,
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.100]   and the housing market's actually down,
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.200]   because there's a 5% commission to sell it,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.040]   yada, yada, yada.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.160]   You don't wanna put yourself in a situation
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.320]   where you're underwater on a house.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.160]   - Yes. - Speaking on behalf--
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.980]   - Make sure you're gonna be in this
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.400]   for like seven to 10 years.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.880]   - Speaking on behalf of millennials,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   I just have to say, this is why young people are mad.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.860]   The idea that $125,000 down payment isn't enough
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.260]   to be able to get a decent house somewhere
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.380]   is kind of infuriating. - Yes, I get it.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.700]   And to his point here, he made it sound like naturally,
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.260]   we have to buy a house, and I get that feeling,
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.060]   but I would run the numbers on does it make sense
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.100]   to rent a little longer too?
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.500]   You don't have to buy a house
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.540]   just because you think you have to.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.220]   No one's forcing your hand here that you have to buy a house.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.040]   - Nope. - True.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.420]   - It's not for everyone. - It's not required.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   - Yeah, you could find maybe better places
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.260]   to use that $125,000 to invest the difference
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.860]   if you're gonna keep renting,
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.620]   and you don't have to.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.700]   - Yeah, if you are a homeowner
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.020]   and you ever wanna make yourself sick,
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.420]   especially if you've bought in the last 15 years,
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.780]   take your down payment and see what it would've been worth
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.180]   if it had been invested in the S&P 500.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.140]   I bet that will give you a little bit of heartburn.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.820]   - True, but yes, I feel like this whole episode
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.900]   is kind of like a PSA against home ownership
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.460]   because insurance costs are rising.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.980]   - It's too expensive. - Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.460]   - Don't do it. - But yeah,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.460]   but that's the thing is you really have to run the numbers.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.740]   You can't just say I'm gonna do this
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.380]   because everyone else is doing it around me
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.300]   and I have to because it's the biggest investment
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.140]   I'll ever make.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.900]   You have to run the numbers and make sure it works for you,
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.700]   and if it doesn't, then it's not worth it.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.100]   - Yeah, on the flip side, I love my house.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.420]   It was worth every stretch,
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.420]   everything I don't get to spend money on,
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.220]   but you have to just weigh the pros and the cons.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.820]   - Yeah, I feel like it's more about the control, right?
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.820]   The finances, I think, in a lot of cases,
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.820]   you guys have proven,
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.900]   it doesn't actually make more sense to buy,
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.520]   but just the peace of mind of this is mine.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.740]   I don't know, I can do whatever I want.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.700]   - The psychic income.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.260]   - It weighs on you, but yeah,
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.280]   you don't wanna get in over your head
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.380]   and totally regret it
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.860]   'cause you can't do anything else in your life
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.940]   'cause the house is eating up everything.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.220]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.660]   Well, I gotta go, guys.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.880]   It's Mardi Gras.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.180]   I'm gonna put on my beads.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.100]   It's Mardi Gras here in New Orleans,
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.140]   so we're gonna have fun, but thanks for having me on.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:50.960]   I really enjoyed it. - It's fine.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.700]   - Speaking of fun, I was gonna ask,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.220]   are you gonna organize a firm-wide trip to the sphere
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.620]   to see the dead?
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.380]   I don't know if you saw it.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.740]   - I wanna talk about that presale.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.380]   It was really tough, but if the firm wants to cover it,
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.040]   I will definitely be the team lead.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.540]   - I think we should push. - And we'll all go out there
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.820]   and we'll have a great time.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.420]   - All right, well, have fun at Mardi Gras.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.260]   I'm jealous. - Thank you.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.680]   - I've never done it before.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.020]   Thanks to Blair for coming on.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.480]   New TCAF tomorrow, as always.
