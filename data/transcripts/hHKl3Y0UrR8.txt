[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   [Christmas music]
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.300]   Well, Christmas anticipation is thick in the air.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.300]   Christmas music dominates the airwaves, and the smell of pumpkin spice permeates everything.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.500]   Beautiful lights brighten the night sky, and in less than one week from today, Christmas will be done.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.200]   All the gifts will be unwrapped and worn or played with, or returned to the store for cash or credit.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   And we're going to take the trees down and the lights down, and we'll toss them out or we'll box them up for another year.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.100]   And it happens every year. There's this subtle sense, this subtle pang of letdown.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.900]   And you can call me a Scrooge to bring it up this time of the year, but I find this sensation rather predictable.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.500]   Perhaps it's because we have overspent and underslept and maybe overeaten.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.300]   Whatever the cause is, Christmas never seems to live up to the buildup.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.600]   So why is that? To answer this question, a couple of years back, Pastor Matt Chandler preached an Advent sermon on Zephaniah 3,
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.800]   verses 14 to 20, in a sermon titled "God's Protection and Delight."
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.700]   And the sermon includes an insightful and helpful meditation on this point to ready us and to steady us for this season.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.400]   Here now is a little clip from Pastor Matt Chandler, a survivor of brain cancer, preaching from Zephaniah chapter 3.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.500]   In verse 15, the text says, "Why do we sing and shout and clap and rejoice with all our hearts?
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.800]   Because according to verse 15, our punishment has been removed."
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.200]   And that's awesome. Like our punishment has been removed.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.300]   We are lawbreakers. We have rebelled against God.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800]   And in Christ, all of our punishment has been removed.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.900]   That's true right now. That your judgment day, Christian, has already occurred.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100]   Now you will stand in front of God and you will give an account.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.400]   And I don't know, for illustration points only, when they open up that file and pull your file out and slap it down,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.100]   it will be dripping with the blood of Christ.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.200]   And when they open up the first page, it will say, "Holy, spotless, blameless."
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.100]   Not because of you, but because of Christ.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.800]   There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.700]   Yeah, I'm preaching. You can clap.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.800]   Right? This is what God has done.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.700]   This is why we look back upon the first coming of Christ and we sing and we shout and we rejoice with all our hearts
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.600]   in the God of our salvation.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.900]   And because there is no punishment for us, we will never again fear harm.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.800]   Now again, we're in the space between. We're in the already, but not yet.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.900]   It's a scary thing to live in a Genesis 3 world.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.100]   I had to go get an MRI this past week. It was nerve-wracking.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.600]   Why though, right?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.400]   I mean, if I die, don't I gain?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.700]   Yeah, but I was still nervous.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.900]   I had no control over it. I was still nervous.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.200]   Met with a woman last night and her teenagers whose husband died Tuesday morning.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.600]   There's some fear there, right?
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.000]   So we're in this space between. We're in the already, but not yet.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   We know what Christ has purchased.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.300]   He's refining us, working us, moving in us, revealing in us,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.400]   churning our hearts, stirring up affection.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.000]   And so we look forward to the second coming of Christ where all of this has been consummated completely.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So we rejoice because punishment has been removed and we will never fear harm.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.800]   And then I love the verse 17. Our God is a mighty warrior who saves.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.600]   I love the imagery of God being a mighty warrior.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.800]   Think about that. God killed death.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   That's incredible.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   What enemy could you and I have that the warrior God of the universe wouldn't smirk at?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.900]   Our God is a warrior. He takes great delight in you.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.300]   According to the text, he will no longer rebuke you.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.500]   And then I love this. I've just got a question about it.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.600]   It says God rejoices over us in singing.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.700]   So quick question. I don't have an answer to but it's a great question.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.300]   If the spoken word of God created the expanse of the universe,
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.700]   so powerful was the let there be light,
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.200]   that the universe continues to this day to expand in every direction.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.300]   What does the singing of God do over the hearts of men and women?
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.400]   In verse 18, we see that there'll be no mourning. In verse 19, there's no more oppression.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   The lame will be rescued. The exiles will be gathered.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.400]   And then in verse 20, we will all be brought home.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.000]   I love verse 20. See, if we're honest, that all of us have a bit of a restless heart, right?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.700]   We have this anticipation that one day that restlessness will end.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.400]   And so we've been paying it forward our whole lives, have we not?
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.300]   You just can't wait to get to high school.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.100]   And then you can't wait to get a car. And then you can't wait to get out of high school.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.700]   And then you can't wait to get to college. And then you can't wait to get out of college.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.200]   And then you can't wait to get a good job.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.700]   You can't wait to find a man or a woman to marry.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.500]   You can't wait to make a certain amount of money.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.300]   You can't wait to buy your first home. Can't wait to have a kid.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.400]   Can't wait for that kid to go to school. Can't wait for that kid to get out of your house.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.500]   Can't wait to, right? You just keep paying it forward.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.700]   And yet, that I'm not quite there yet is persistent.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.600]   And it just doesn't go away. Like Bono nailed it, didn't he?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.800]   And I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.600]   And then some Christians grabbed that and brutalized great theology.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.100]   They sang, "And I finally found what I'm looking for."
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.100]   No, no, no. You're ignoring the theology of the song.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.600]   The theology of the song is that we're in the space between.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.300]   That all this is true about us right now in Christ.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.700]   And yet in the space between, the refining fire of God's love is purifying,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.400]   transforming, working for our good.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.100]   What we long for is the second advent.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.400]   And in the coming of Christ, his life, death, and resurrection,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   our hearts have found their home.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.700]   They breathe. They rest while we anticipate the coming of Christ.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   And listen, this is what Christmas is all about.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.700]   So we're Chandler Manor is decked out.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.600]   All right, stockings are up. Trees are up.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.700]   Trees, plural. Lost that fight about eight years ago.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.100]   I don't even get in anymore. I'm just like, "All right, how many?
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.600]   Just two? Okay, let's go get them."
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.100]   And so trees are up.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.900]   It honestly looks like Christmas vacation vomited in my house.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.400]   So we're ready to roll.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   And my 10-year-old, for whatever it's him right now, is just geeked out of his mind.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   A couple of times a day, we'll get asked, "How many more days?"
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.400]   So there's a couple of presents wrapped.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.300]   They're under the tree.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.800]   Every little movement forward kind of ratchets up the anticipation.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.900]   And so we're not far. Come up here.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.200]   Do around 6,000 services. Collapse and sleep. Wake up.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.500]   We'll open up presents. Family will come over.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.300]   We'll laugh. We'll have a great time with them.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.500]   And then everyone will go home and we'll—not that night,
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.100]   but we'll start to take everything down.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.500]   And nobody's allowed to say this, but we all feel it.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.100]   There'll be a tinge of disappointment.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.800]   That was it. That was it. Since Thanksgiving, we've been gearing towards this.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.000]   We've been amped about this.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   You'll be frustrated with your kids because they're a little selfish heart.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.200]   They'll just do something with a present that you spent good money for.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   And they're like, "Well, really, I wanted the one, not the 360."
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.000]   And you'll do what godly parents do, which is threaten.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.300]   "I'll take all your presents back. I'll start a fire, if you know what I'm saying."
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.200]   So what's wired into this season is a sense of anticipation.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.900]   It's almost magical what occurs if you're really into Christmas.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.900]   I mean, we were slated this week to go out and look at lights.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.200]   We're already three deep into Christmas parties.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.500]   Got another one tonight. On Thursday, the Flower Mound Campus and Elders.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.300]   We're going to go around this neighborhood and sing carols and hand out Advent guides.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.600]   And I mean, we're all in. My kids are all in.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.800]   There's this great anticipation for what is to come and we're all going to be disappointed.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.200]   Okay, so apparently you're not following me.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   The reason we're going to be disappointed is because all of this is a shadow of a greater reality.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:40.700]   What's going on right now is meant to dial me in to an anticipation for that day that being disappointed is impossible.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.400]   Like so rich and deep is the love of God that at the consummation of all things,
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:55.900]   10 billion years from now, it'll be just as fresh, just as beautiful, and just as freeing as it's ever been.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.300]   That's the inexhaustible well of God's grace.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.400]   You know, you experience some of the first time, it's just incredible.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.000]   And then the more you experience, the more it kind of loses its luster.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.500]   Well, according to the Word of God, according to what happens at the consummation of all things,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.600]   that the Apostle Paul tells us in the book of Ephesians, that it'll take the coming ages,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.800]   millennia, for us to even get a sense of how deep the love of God is for those he loves,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.100]   the treasures of his grace.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.800]   And so I don't know how you're wired.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.200]   I think of 10 billion years, I'm like, I don't care what it is, I'm going to be bored out of my mind.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.000]   Right, I can't even now do something more than a day or two before I'm like, all right, what's next?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.500]   And yet so deep is the inexhaustible well of God that for eternity, our delight increases,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.700]   our joy grows.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.700]   This is what Christmas is all about.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.000]   We look back upon the coming of Christ, and we rejoice in what's true right now.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.300]   We sing, we shout, we rejoice because these things are true right now.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.900]   Our punishment has been removed.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.300]   That's true right now.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.700]   Fear is losing its power over us right now.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.900]   We've moved farther.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.700]   We've grown.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.400]   We've seen God work in us, all right?
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.900]   God is a mighty warrior who has saved and continues to battle on our behalf.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.800]   There is a loss of power of mourning over our lives.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.700]   We mourn, but don't mourn like those who don't have hope.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.700]   We mourn like those who have hope.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.500]   The woman last night we met with, Michael and I did, who lost her husband on Tuesday.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.100]   She felt guilty for not sobbing and breaking down in our conversation.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.200]   I'm like, sister, like everyone's praying for you the peace that passes understanding.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.600]   Don't feel bad about this.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.900]   Rejoice and be glad that you're mourning like someone who has hope.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.500]   This is true right now.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.600]   Yes, no more oppression.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.400]   Oppression is losing its power.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.900]   The lame rescued disease losing its power.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.200]   The exiles will be gathered.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   Brothers, sisters, we are aliens, strangers, exiles in this world.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.400]   And yet Christ, the great rescuer, the great redeemer, gathers,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.700]   and that we have been brought home now.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:19.600]   And so we sit in that and we rejoice in that while looking for the second coming,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.200]   pleading for the second advent.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:32.400]   This is why John ends the book of Revelation with, "Come, Lord Jesus, Maranatha."
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   I'll end the clip here.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.700]   It's such a great reminder.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.200]   Christmas is wonderful as it is.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.900]   It's not the thing.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.700]   This season will never satisfy our hearts.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:48.300]   There's a second advent coming, and that should rivet our hearts like a child waiting
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.000]   for some Christmas morning that hasn't yet happened.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.800]   In other words, we have a longing that remains and cannot ever get pacified,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.100]   even in our best holiday celebrations.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.600]   That is so helpful.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.100]   Matt Chandler, thank you, brother, for that reminder and for pressing us to think about it.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.900]   Again, that was from his advent sermon titled, "God's Protection and Delight"
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.200]   on Zephaniah 3, verses 14 to 20.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.000]   You can find it online at the Village Church website.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.400]   Well, Christmas draws closer, and we have one final Christmas episode.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.200]   And it's a question about the marvelous fact that Jesus learned obedience as a boy.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:32.600]   Scripture tells us Jesus as a boy, "Increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and men."
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   Huh? So how on earth did Jesus grow in maturity and why?
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.400]   And how will this give substance to our Christmas celebration this year?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.500]   That's the next episode, and it will be launching on Sunday night at 7 p.m.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:53.300]   Central Time, which is Christmas Eve, or you can listen to it Christmas Day or later on Monday.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.900]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.200]   Thanks for listening to the podcast, and we'll see you then.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   .
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   .
