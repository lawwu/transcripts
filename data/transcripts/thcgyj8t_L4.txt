[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   So the consistency of the LSB is one of the things that I appreciate about it the most
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.380]   and I think it helps the reader because it shows what the original author was doing.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.980]   So for example, if you look at Jonah chapter 2 verse 1 the author uses the word 'meah'
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.440]   for belly and then in chapter 2 verse 2 he uses the word 'batan' for stomach, those
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.380]   are two synonyms in Hebrew and they mean the same thing essentially but they're different
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.360]   words, 'batan' and 'meah' are different words.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.280]   A lot of texts will just say Jonah was in the belly, Jonah was in the belly but the
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.720]   LSB says Jonah was in the stomach, Jonah was in the belly to show that the original author
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.760]   used two words, they mean the same thing but they're synonyms which highlights the artistry,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.760]   the poetic nature, the ability of the original author to use different words and communicate
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.020]   God's word more effectively and the English reader through the LSB is able to see that.
