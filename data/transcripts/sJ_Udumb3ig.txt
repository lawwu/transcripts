[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   [silence]
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.940]   If you listen to the series with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.700]   you may recall our discussion about the sugar cane,
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.900]   which is so named after our friend
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300]   and expert trainer, Kenny Kane.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.020]   And it is a very efficient, yet somewhat brutal way
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.620]   to increase your cardiovascular output.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.940]   So the sugar cane is the type of protocol
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.780]   that you would incorporate once in the period of a week,
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.980]   but certainly not every week.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280]   It's the kind of thing that you might throw in
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.500]   once every two weeks or once every four weeks
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.300]   as a replacement for your other
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.400]   high-intensity interval training.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.720]   The sugar cane involves selecting some form of exercise
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.000]   that you can do at high intensity safely.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.120]   And of course, it will differ between individuals.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.280]   For some of you, it will be a stationary bike.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.680]   For others of you, it will be a road bike.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.160]   For others of you, it will be running.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.320]   And for others of you, it will be rowing.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880]   The exact form of exercise is not important.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.360]   What is important is that you can generate
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.520]   a lot of intensity.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.960]   So you're going to be doing some sprint-like work,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.760]   although not all-out sprints, except on the final round.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.100]   I'll explain where all this is going in a moment.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.920]   But again, you need to select a movement
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.360]   that you can do without injuring yourself
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.920]   while still performing a movement at high intensity.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560]   So for me, that would be running.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.480]   For you, it might be something else.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.360]   The sugar cane is pretty straightforward in structure.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   It involves three rounds after a brief warmup, of course.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.920]   So you're going to do three to five minutes of jogging
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.400]   or jumping jacks or skipping rope,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.560]   something to get your core body temperature up
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.360]   so that you're prepared to do the high-intensity work.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   And then there are only three rounds of high-intensity work,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.160]   and they go as the following.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.100]   In round one, you're going to take two minutes,
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.200]   so you'll need to set a timer for two minutes,
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.660]   and you're going to go the maximum distance
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.980]   that you can in that two minutes.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.640]   So run the maximum distance that you can for two minutes
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.120]   or cycle the maximum distance
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.640]   that you can for two minutes
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.380]   or versa-climber the maximum distance
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.200]   that you can for two minutes.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560]   Whatever you select, you're going to do that
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.840]   as far and as fast as you can
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.360]   for the duration of two minutes.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.740]   So depending on the movement
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.520]   and depending on your level of fitness,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   that distance might be 400 meters,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.960]   600 meters, 800 meters, et cetera.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.480]   Whatever distance you travel in that two minutes,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.640]   you are going to mark that distance down in your mind
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   or in your phone or on a piece of paper.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.520]   And then you're going to rest two minutes.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.080]   So two minutes of work, then rest two minutes.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.200]   Then in round two,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.420]   you're going to go the same distance
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.000]   that you did in round one,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.880]   and you're going to take as much time
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.840]   as you need to do that distance as fast as you can.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.480]   So if you went 600 meters in two minutes for round one,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.260]   in round two, you're going to go 600 meters,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.040]   and it's going to take you however long it takes you.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.560]   Chances are, if you really did the best you could
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.840]   in round one,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.360]   you were at maximum output for the first two minutes,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.520]   that in round two,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.360]   it's going to take you longer than two minutes
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.380]   to travel that equivalent distance.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.160]   However, there is the possibility
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.720]   that it will take you less time.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.360]   But for most people, it's going to take you more time.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   So staying with this example of 600 meters
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.320]   in two minutes on round one,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.100]   in round two, you're going to go 600 meters.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.960]   Let's say it takes you two minutes and 30 seconds.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.120]   You then are going to mark down how long round two took you.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.600]   So in this case, the example is two minutes and 30 seconds.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.360]   Then you're going to rest another two minutes.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.140]   And then in round three,
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.520]   you're going to go all out, again,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.000]   as fast and as safely as you can
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.240]   for the same duration that you did in round two.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.160]   And your goal is to go at least as far
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.560]   as you went in round one.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.420]   And if there's still time left,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.480]   you're going to continue to go all out,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.800]   again, as fast as you safely can
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.840]   until the entire duration is completed.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.720]   So it's really just three rounds
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.960]   with two rest periods in between round one and round three.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.880]   And then I highly recommend that after round three,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.960]   that you do some sort of dedicated cool down.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.840]   So instead of just flopping onto the bench
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.260]   or the floor or the lawn,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.680]   that you walk around slowly
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.400]   until you recover your breathing.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.760]   The reason I like the sugar cane
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.520]   as a tool that one implements
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.100]   once every, say, two to four weeks
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.400]   as a replacement for one's typical
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.780]   high-intensity interval training is several fold.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.000]   First of all, if you provide the right intensity
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.680]   in round one and round two and round three,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.140]   it is sure to elevate your heart rate substantially.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.740]   And in doing so, improve your VO2 max,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.280]   which is correlated with all sorts of important metrics
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.240]   related to health span, performance, and lifespan.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.840]   Second of all, it gamifies things a little bit.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.720]   It pits you against yourself
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.800]   in the sense that if you go out at maximum speed,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.280]   again, performing a movement that you can safely perform
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.800]   at maximum speed in round one,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   well, then you have something to compete against
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.080]   in round two and round three.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.600]   And that makes the high-intensity interval training,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240]   first of all, very intense,
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.600]   but also it makes it kind of fun
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.120]   in a way that lets you forget
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.000]   just how painful the whole thing is.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.580]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.000]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.860]   (upbeat music)
