[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I should like to call your attention this evening to that portion of Scripture that
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.320]   we read together at the beginning, which is to be found, you remember, in the Gospel according
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.480]   to St. John, in chapter 12, beginning at verse 20 and going on to verse 41. If you like a
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.640]   particular text, let us take verse 21.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him saying,
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.800]   "Sir, we would see Jesus." But as I am explaining, I really want to consider the entire account
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.140]   with you, because it is all devoted to an explanation of what happened as the result
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.840]   of the Greeks putting this request of theirs and their desire to see Jesus to Philip, who
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.120]   then passed it on to Andrew, and how Andrew and Philip came to our Lord himself.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.640]   Now this is a strange incident, something unusual about it, and something rather surprising
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.440]   about it, because here we have an account of certain people coming with a request and
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.280]   their desire to see our Lord, but whose request was not granted. And that, I say, comes to
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.240]   us of necessity whoever read these Gospels as a surprise, because there was nothing that
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920]   was so characteristic of our Lord as his readiness to receive anybody.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.200]   Indeed, we have incidents here in which we are told how his readiness to see people and
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.600]   to talk to them annoyed the disciples. They more than once tried to stop people coming
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.000]   to him and speaking to him. They tried, you remember, to hinder a blind man who was in
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.840]   that condition. They tried to stop the women that would bring their children to him, but
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.960]   in spite of that he insisted upon seeing them. There was nothing more characteristic of him
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.400]   than his readiness to receive all and sundry. The Pharisees were very annoyed that he was
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.840]   always ready to receive publicans and sinners. A woman guilty of adultery, other types of
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.280]   women, he was always ready to receive. Indeed, he even received a Syrophoenician woman on
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.080]   one occasion. He spoke kindly to a centurion, a Roman who belonged to the Roman army. And
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.920]   yet here, I say, we are confronted by a refusal on his part. The Greeks come desiring to see
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.280]   him, but he did not see them. He did not receive them.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.680]   Now, I say, here is something that should surely cause us to stop for a moment and to
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.200]   think and to ponder. Why did our Lord behave like this on this occasion? And very fortunately
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.080]   for us, he gives the answers to our question himself. And all that I have to do, therefore,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.120]   is to expound to you and hold before you the reasons that were given by the Son of God
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   himself for his refusal to see this deputation of Greeks that came with the desire to see
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   him.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:37.040]   Now, this is surely a most important incident for us to consider. I mean by that that it
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.320]   is an incident that helps us to understand the case and the position of quite a number
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.280]   of people in this modern world of ours. There are many people today who, because of the
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.920]   whole state of the world, and perhaps because of their own personal problems, are becoming
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.120]   interested in this Jesus. Everything else seems to have failed, so they turn to him
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.880]   and they look to him. And in their way, they make their request to see him, feeling that
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.360]   he has something to give, feeling that perhaps he is the one who is going to help. But in
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.600]   spite of this, they do not seem to get satisfaction. Nothing seems to result from their attempt
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.480]   to get into contact with him. They feel they are left where they were, that he has got
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.100]   nothing to say, that there is no deliverance, that there is no salvation. They do not get
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.680]   what they hoped they might have got when they came to him.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.960]   Now this incident, therefore, is of extreme value as we consider the case of all such
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   people. What of you, my friend, what is your position? Have you met this Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:06.200]   Do you know him? Have you been blessed by him? Is he the benefactor of your soul? Can
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.320]   you say tonight that he is everything to you, and more than everything? There have been
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.600]   people like you in this world, like Charles Wesley, who have been able to say quite honestly,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.640]   "Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find." Can you say that?
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.000]   There are people in this book, I say, who found everything in him. There are people
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.760]   in the subsequent history of the Church who have testified to the same thing. Our hymns
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.520]   are full of it. Can you say that? Has Christ met you? Have you met him? Has he answered
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.960]   your questions? Has he solved your problems? That is the matter that is before us. And
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.320]   there is no more urgent matter that anyone can consider in this world at this very moment
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.720]   than just this thing that we are considering together.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.360]   Well now, I say, if you have not so known him, if you have not found rest and satisfaction
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.840]   and deliverance in him, well, my dear friend, let me appeal to you above everybody else
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.520]   to listen to this incident, to listen especially to what he himself has got to say about it
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:27.360]   all. For he gives the reasons why people do not know him and do not receive his blessings.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:36.360]   Now we must start, of course, by looking at these Greeks, the people who made the request.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.280]   These are interesting people. There were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.960]   at the feast. There was a feast on, a Jewish religious feast in Jerusalem. And amongst
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.280]   the people who came from different parts of the world, as they did in those days, they
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.320]   gathered together, congregated together in Jerusalem on these great festal occasions.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   And here amongst the company that had come up were certain Greeks. They were very interesting
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.600]   people. And if we are to understand the real meaning of this incident, we must be quite
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.720]   clear about these Greeks. What were they? Well, they were literally Greeks, and had
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.400]   probably come from Greece itself, or if not, they were Greek people who were living in
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:29.040]   other parts of the world. But here they are up at Jerusalem at a Jewish religious festival.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.320]   What does this tell us? Well, we know exactly what it means to be a Greek, and particularly
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:42.480]   in these ancient times. The thing that characterized the Greeks was their great and profound knowledge
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.640]   of philosophy. There is no question about this. They as a nation had produced the greatest
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.600]   philosophers that the world had ever known. It's still true to say that. Quite outstanding.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.080]   That little nation, that small race of people, had thrown up these mighty philosophers, this
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.240]   succession of these great men. That was the first thing that characterized the life of
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.000]   the Greek. He was interested in thought, in life. The Greek wasn't a man who was content
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.480]   just to eat and drink and have a good time and not think. No, no, he wanted to know what
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.080]   it was all about. He wanted to understand the world. He wanted to understand life. He
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.120]   asked his questions. He put up his propositions. And there were different answers, and they
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.520]   had their schools of thought and so on. Well, now there they were. They were full of that
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.960]   sort of thing. But there was another thing that characterized them, you remember. And
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:42.120]   that was that they worshipped a multiplicity of gods. When the Apostle Paul visited Athens,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.800]   the first thing that hit him in the eye was the multiplicity of temples there. The place
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.200]   was literally cluttered with temples to various gods.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.840]   Now, what did this mean? Well, this meant, you see, that in the last analysis, their
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.560]   philosophy didn't satisfy them, didn't answer all their questions. They felt there
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.760]   were other factors and powers they couldn't account for. And the only thing to do then
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.880]   was to placate them. So they built their temples to these various gods and went and worshipped
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.320]   them and took their offerings to them.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.000]   Well those are the two main things. There were other things we know about that characterized
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.240]   them. Their love of sport, their cultivation of the human frame and health, and things
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:32.200]   like that. Well now, there they are. They were Greeks. But here they are, up at Jerusalem,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:40.400]   at a festival devoted to the worship of the God, the one God of the Jews, the Israelites.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.520]   What does it mean? Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They were dissatisfied. All that their
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:52.240]   own culture had got to give them wasn't enough. They were dissatisfied with it. They
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.440]   were looking for something else. And they'd heard, some way or another, about the teaching
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.000]   concerning this God of Israel, the kind of teaching that we've got recorded in the
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.680]   pages of our Old Testament. They'd come to see, moreover, that this was the only
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:16.440]   true and living God. That what they'd worshipped before as gods were not gods at all, but the
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.760]   creations of their own minds and imaginations. And they had come to see and to believe the
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:30.000]   teaching of the Jews, that there is only one God, the true, the only true and living God.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.720]   And they had come to believe in him. They were proselytes, the proselytes of the gate,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.080]   as they're sometimes called. And so it was, you see, that they'd come up to the
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:48.320]   festival in Jerusalem. Now this tells us a great deal about them and their whole background.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.520]   But now, having come up to Jerusalem, they begin to hear about this strange new teacher
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.440]   called Jesus of Nazareth, who's creating such a stir, people crowding after him. They'd
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.000]   probably listened to him. They'd probably seen some of his miracles, or else certainly
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.320]   had heard of them. And here was a strange new phenomenon. And they want to see him.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.120]   So they make the request, "Sir, we would see Jesus." Now this again is surely significant.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.600]   What does this tell us? Well, it tells us that even the Jews' religion didn't finally
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:29.760]   satisfy them again. They were something further, something they needed. They didn't know
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:36.200]   it. And here was this phenomenon, this new teacher, this strange power, this amazing
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.680]   speaker. And they began to wonder whether this wasn't perhaps the one they should
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:49.840]   be seeing after all. So in their lack of satisfaction, they make the request to see Jesus. Now we
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:58.440]   draw this deduction, that you can even have a belief in God and still not be satisfied.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.400]   There are many people like that in the world tonight. There are many people like these
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.000]   Greeks. They've had learning, they've had understanding, they may have dabbled with
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.280]   philosophy, they may have tried the cults, they've turned here, there, and everywhere,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.840]   but they can't find peace. They don't know rest. They're bewildered. They're
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.640]   alarmed by life, and they don't know where they are. They're in difficulties personally,
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   and they see the whole world situation as nothing but a kind of exaggeration and projection
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   of what they are in and of themselves. They may say that they've always believed in
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.040]   God and that they've got a belief in God. Well, all these things may be true of somebody
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:45.920]   listening to me at this moment. But the question is, I ask again, have you found satisfaction?
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:53.520]   Have you found rest for your soul? How are you standing up to the strain of life today?
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.200]   How do you look into the future? What if the end is at hand? What about it? Are you ready?
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.720]   Can you say that you're unafraid? Can you say that you've got understanding? Can
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.240]   you say that Christ has enabled you to face it all, and that you can stand and say, "Come
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.440]   what may, I know whom I have believed"? Now then, that's the great question. The
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.480]   Greeks, you see, pose all that for us. They're very representative, are they not, of a large
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.040]   number of men and women at this present time. I believe that it's an increasing number.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.440]   I believe that the world, in utter bankruptcy, is beginning to turn to the Christian Church,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:40.920]   turning again in the direction of this Jesus. Is he the one who has the answer? But our
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.400]   Lord wouldn't see these people. That's the thing that we are confronted by. He wouldn't
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:53.240]   see them. He wouldn't speak to them. Why not? Why wouldn't he see them? Now that's
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.240]   the vital question. There's something wrong somewhere, isn't there? Well, doesn't it
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.200]   mean this, and this is the only answer. There were some very good reasons why he wouldn't
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.760]   see them. One of the main answers, indeed, I suppose the chief answer of all is, the
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:15.160]   very circumstances of the hour. It was just as it were before his death. That undoubtedly
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   is one of the main factors. But it's not the only factor. Our Lord, in his discourse,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.640]   makes it quite clear that there was something wrong about the whole approach of these Greeks.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.780]   And that's the thing that I want to expound to you this evening. Let me put it the other
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:41.000]   way around. Why is it that people who become interested in Jesus Christ, as it were, come
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.160]   to him, or desire to come to him, and never find him, never find anything in him? Though
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.960]   they've been interested in Christianity, they know nothing about the comfort and the
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:55.200]   consolation. They've never really seen the truth. Why is it? What's the matter? What
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.960]   is the trouble? Well, now, here is the answer. Our Lord lays down this general proposition.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:11.240]   There are certain things which are absolutely essential before we can ever truly know him.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:19.960]   We will never know him as our saviour and redeemer, except we conform to certain desiderata,
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   certain conditions, which he lays down here for us perfectly, plainly, and clearly. What
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:34.280]   are they? Well, here's the first. We must approach him in the right way and manner.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.160]   Now this question of the preliminary approach is something that I'm always emphasizing
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.280]   and repeating. Because, clearly, if we are wrong at this very initial point of approach,
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:54.760]   how can we be right anywhere else? Therefore, let us learn negatively what we mustn't
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.440]   do as we approach him. There are certain things that are obvious about these Greeks. You notice
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.360]   how polite they were. Certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.040]   the same came, therefore, to Philip, which was of Bethsaida, of Galilee, and desired
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:20.520]   him saying, "Sir, sir," with their polite people. These were just fishermen, but the
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.760]   Greeks addressed them as "Sir." They're very polite, respectful people. They observed
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:31.200]   certain niceties, their decorum is perfect. "Sir," we would see, "Jesus." And yet
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.480]   there's something, even at that point, which we detect at once, is going to be a hindrance
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.800]   and an obstacle. They're telling us a good deal by their very demeanor and approach and
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:49.840]   politeness that they've got a wrong idea about him. You see, they think of him as a
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:58.960]   great man, and a great man is to be approached in the right way. What do they call it? Protocol.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.720]   You must observe the niceties. You don't rush to such a person. Find out who are his
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.160]   followers and who are his agents, as it were, and you make your polite request, and it gets
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.720]   passed along, and eventually you're hopeful that you'll be allowed into the presence
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.960]   of this great man. I'm not exaggerating, it's there. It's emphasized that they did
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.680]   approach him that particular way. What else was wrong, you think, about their approach?
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.880]   Well, isn't there a suggestion here, I'm sure there is, I'm certain of it, that their
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.480]   whole motive for seeing him wasn't right, it wasn't true? What was it? Well, I'm
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:48.720]   sure that there was a little curiosity about it. New phenomenon, strange preacher, someone
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.800]   who'd suddenly come right into the midst of all that had been going on for centuries.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.400]   What is this? They're anxious to see it, curiosity. And they're animated partly by
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.800]   that and by a general interest in him. They were intelligent people, they're Greeks,
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.040]   remember. And they thought, well, no, we'd like to put a few questions to him. We'd
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.400]   like to know what he really is saying. It wasn't merely a question of seeing him in
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.080]   a physical sense, because they'd probably seen him many times. To see him means to have
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.680]   an interview with him, to be able to put questions to him, and then to get his answers. In other
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.440]   words, don't you see here that the motive at the back of it all was, as it were, to
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:36.160]   examine him, and to assess him, find out his teaching exactly, see what they thought of
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.920]   it. They'd got a background. Well, now then, they come to him in this way, they're very
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.520]   kind and polite and respectful, yes, that's all right. But the whole time they're rarely
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.880]   coming as men and women who are more or less equal. They recognize he is outstanding, but
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.840]   they want to question him and cross-examine him. They want to come to an assessment concerning
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.760]   his teaching. They want to see Jesus in order that they may be able to sum him up and see
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.880]   what he really has got to say, whether he can help them or not, and what they're finally
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:16.600]   to make of him. Now there I see that in all the approach of these people. "Sir," we
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:24.120]   would say, "Jesus." Now, surely there's a great deal of this at the present time, and
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.280]   it's often very polite and very respectful. But this is the approach of so many to this
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.360]   person. There are many still who have always approached him and will approach him in the
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:43.400]   coming days as just a babe of Bethlehem. They're interested in that idyllic story. Very beautiful,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.680]   they say, the most wonderful, beautiful story in the world. And they enjoy the story of
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.960]   the babe of Bethlehem. They like singing carols. They don't sing many hymns, but they like
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.360]   singing carols. And they do it once a year regularly. They think it's very wonderful
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:05.600]   and very beautiful. That's the approach. There's an element of patronage in it. They're
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.920]   looking on, on the babe. A beautiful story in an ugly world. Love in the midst of much
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.400]   hatred and confusion. But that's the approach of so many. Then you see there are those who,
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:26.320]   like these Greeks, still more definitely are interested in him only as a teacher, as a
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.680]   kind of reformer. What's Christ got to say? What's Jesus say? And they're interested
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.840]   in his teaching. They think it may help in the present predicament of the world. It may
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.160]   have something to say to us. So they come and examine it. Is there any good in it? Can
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.440]   we take it out? Can we use it? Interested in him just as the teacher, as the political
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.880]   reformer, and so on and so forth. Still, you see, it's the same attitude. A great man,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.000]   perhaps the greatest man who's ever lived, but no more. So they come with great respect.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.640]   Sir, we would see Jesus. But that's the spirit in which they come, and that's the
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.560]   desire that animates them. These men were undoubtedly interested in him as the Jewish
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:14.280]   Messiah. And to them he was one who claimed to be that, and they were interested in examining
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.360]   and in investigating that. Well, I needn't keep you. Let me ask you a simple question,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:25.840]   my friend. What's your motive as you come to him? How do you really approach him? When
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.680]   you say, "I would see Jesus," how do you say it? What is it that you've really got
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.840]   in your mind? Now then, I say that that's not the right approach. It's because that
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:44.000]   was their approach that our Lord didn't see them. What is the approach then? Well,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.680]   you know, there's a wonderful answer to all this in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.440]   Had you noticed it? Had you noticed how the people who rarely were blessed by him came
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.640]   to him and approached him? How different. The first thing I notice about all these others
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:09.360]   is there's an absence of this protocol, this politeness and the correct approach.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.880]   What you find, well, this is what you find. There he is in a house one day, seated, in
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:20.520]   order to have a meal. And suddenly a poor woman, a very sinful woman at that, began
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.560]   to wash his feet with the tears that came pouring out of her eyes. And then she proceeded
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.200]   to dry them with the hair of her head. She didn't ask anybody for introduction. No,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.520]   no. She was a woman, a sinner, and she had a deep need and a deep realization. Do you
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.120]   remember the other woman? He was in a great crowd. She just touched the hem of his garment.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.960]   She didn't say, "Sir, give me an introduction." You look at them, every single one of them,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.360]   the publicans and sinners didn't make any request. They just pressed after him. Do you
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.560]   remember the men of Gadara? When he saw him, he rushed to meet him. Every person who was
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   ever blessed by him came to him in that way. They don't seem to be as polite as these Greeks.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.040]   No, no. You see, when your heart is broken and when you're conscious of your need, you
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.760]   forget your good manners and your politeness. You just rush to him. As the only one who
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:19.240]   can save you, there's an essential difference at that very point. But our Lord, of course,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:26.320]   emphasizes this all for us. Notice his extraordinary reply to this request. Jesus answered them,
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:35.720]   saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified." That's his answer.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:41.320]   I'm not going to see these people, he says. Why not? Well, because it's a waste of time
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:47.880]   at this point. They're all wrong in their approach and in all their ideas concerning
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.000]   me. They come to me as a man, as a great man, as the Jewish Messiah, as someone who can
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.800]   teach and help. I'm not. I'm the Son of Man. Son of Man. Not a great man, but the Son of
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:12.000]   Man. He's making a unique claim. In other words, he is asserting his person and his
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.280]   unique deity. He uses the term "glorified." This is the time, the hour has come that the
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.760]   Son of Man should be glorified. What does that mean? Well, he'll explain it later on.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.360]   In the 17th chapter, he prays, "The Father, give me back," he said again, "the glory
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:35.520]   which thy had with thee before the foundation of the world." "Glorified," again demonstrated
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.240]   to be the Son of God whom he is, that the glory may again be manifest. He's been here
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.800]   in the flesh, and the glory is hidden. Let it be seen. The hour has come, he said, when
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:53.360]   it's about to happen, when the declaration will be made that I am who I am. And then
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.760]   you notice in that 32nd verse, he makes this great claim, "And I, if I be lifted up from
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:05.960]   the earth, will draw all men unto me." And all men there means not every single individual
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:12.000]   in the world, it means all nations. He'd kept himself to the Jews only, and these are
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.960]   Greeks. And what he's saying in effect is, "I can't receive Greeks now, but after
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.200]   I've been lifted up," which means, as we are told, the manner of death which he died,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.520]   namely being lifted up on a cross, crucified, "then I will draw men from all the nations
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.720]   of the world unto me. I'm not the Jewish Messiah, I am the Savior of the world."
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   Now that's what he's saying. So you see, our Lord lays it down in the first instance,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:50.760]   that this whole matter of approach unto him is a very important and a very vital one.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:56.640]   If you come to him as a great man amongst other great men, you'll never know him. If
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.360]   you come to him just as a great teacher and no more, he'll never give you his benefits,
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.440]   never. It doesn't matter how polite, how correct your approach, it doesn't matter
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:14.320]   how interested, how intellectually involved you may be, it'll never help you. He is
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.120]   not to be approached on that level. He won't take people on that level. You try to bring
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.040]   him down to the level of the philosophers or the statesmen or anything else and just
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.400]   put him there, he won't speak to you. You'll find that he'll no more receive you than
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:40.500]   he received these Greeks. He is the Son of Man. You've got to realize who he is before
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.240]   you'll ever get any benefit from him. You can take his teaching alone, it won't help
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.920]   you. It's a great teaching, yes, you can add it to your philosophies, it won't save
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:58.720]   you, it'll never give you that final soul rest and satisfaction. No, no. All who have
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:06.560]   ever known his blessing have realized that he is Son of God, Son of Man, that he is someone
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.520]   who has come into this world out of eternity. He is not a man amongst men, he is God in
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:19.200]   the flesh. He's the glorious one that has come out of the everlasting glory into time
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:27.760]   and has returned again to it. The Son of Man must be glorified. And he stands uniquely
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:36.480]   before us as the only one who has ever ventured to say that he is the Savior of the world.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.560]   Of the whole, there is none other, he is alone, none other name under him given amongst men
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:51.640]   whereby we must be saved. Very well, there's the first step. This matter of the initial
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:58.540]   approach is absolutely vital and essential. Come, my friend, let's be clear and practical
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.000]   about this. I'm not here just to preach of something that happened in the past, I'm
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.440]   concerned about you. Do you know him? Has he made all the difference in the world to
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.160]   you? Has he taken away from you the fear of death and the fear of the morrow? Do you know
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:25.960]   him? Well, start by realizing who he is. Son of God, Son of Man, the only Savior of the
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:34.200]   world. But let's go on to the second matter. The second point that he insists upon is this,
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:47.160]   that we must believe in absolutely the necessity and the cruciality of his death upon the cross.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:55.600]   Now this is the chief matter here. I reminded you just now that our Lord was undoubtedly
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.800]   influenced by the fact that this was just before his death. And so he begins to talk
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:08.480]   about that. It is absolutely essential if we are to know him as our Savior, that we
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:19.720]   believe in the absolute necessity of his death. I am not detracting from his life, his example,
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:28.600]   his teaching. It is all absolutely perfect. But he tells us himself beyond any doubt or
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:37.360]   uncertainty that his life, his example, his teaching, his everything cannot save us. There
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:46.080]   is only one thing that saves us, and that is his death upon the cross.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.840]   Now this is obviously absolutely vital and crucial to us, isn't it? It is he who says
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:57.880]   that, it isn't me. He says that if we are wrong here, there is no value in anything
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.760]   else. Listen to what he says about his death. Let me put it before you. He says, first of
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.720]   all, that he had come into this world in order to die. Now then, here is the season of Advert,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.280]   the Babe of Bethlehem. All right, if you are interested, let me ask you a question. Why
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.840]   did he ever come? Why did the Son of God ever come into this world? That is the crucial
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.960]   question. He is not just talking about Christmas. He is not just talking about the Incarnation,
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:32.320]   unless you know why he came. Why did he ever enter into the Virgin's womb and be born
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.000]   as a helpless babe? What is it for? This is his answer. He came in order to die. "The
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.480]   hour," he says, "the hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified." I do
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.720]   commend to you a reading of this Gospel of John during these coming days. And watch this
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   term, "the hour." He keeps on talking about the hour, "my hour is not yet come,"
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.560]   he keeps on saying. But now he says, "the hour is come." What is this hour? Well,
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:07.600]   it is his death. It is the thing he is going to talk about. He has come into this world
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.960]   in order to die. Listen to it in verse 27 again. I have given you verse 23. Listen to
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:22.440]   27. "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:32.560]   hour?' No, but for this cause came I unto this hour." Here he is in his agony, and
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.480]   he, as it were, talks to himself and says, "Shall I ask God to deliver me, to save
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.120]   me from this death?" He says, "No, it was because of this and in order to do this
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:49.320]   that I came into this world. For this cause came I unto this hour." That is why he
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.600]   has come. That is why he is in the world at all. Now this is the teaching of the New Testament
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:00.200]   everywhere, summed up very perfectly in the second chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.800]   in the ninth verse. We see Jesus made a little lower than the angels. That is the incarnation,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:16.240]   the babe, made a little lower than the angels. What for? For the suffering of death. That
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:22.800]   is why he was made a little lower than the angels, in order that he might suffer death.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.520]   Why did he come into the world? The same verse says, "In order that he might, by the
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:36.200]   grace of God, taste death for every man." That babe came into the world not to live
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.080]   but to die. It is the whole object and purpose of his coming, he says so here. But listen
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.840]   to the second thing he says. He says that he can bear no fruit, he can do no good, unless
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:56.520]   he dies. Here it is in verse 24. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:04.640]   fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.120]   Here is a corn of wheat, a seed. As it is there in my hand, it is no good at all. If
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.120]   this seed is going to bring forth fruit, you have got to bury it in the ground. It has
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:21.160]   got to die and it gives great fruit. He says, "I am like that." He has got to die before
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.080]   he can bear fruit. Nobody will be saved unless he dies. His teaching cannot save, his example
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.360]   cannot save. He has got to die, he is like the corn of wheat, it must die. Now this is
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.560]   his own teaching and it is absolutely crucial. You see the Greeks know nothing about this.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.520]   They come to him as a philosopher and as a Jewish Messiah, a political leader, and they
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.320]   are interested. "No, no," he says, "I cannot save you that way. I am like the corn of wheat,
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.640]   I have got to die, I have got to be buried in the ground. I have come for that, it must
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:55.240]   happen." And then the third thing, he says in verse 32, "I, if I be lifted up from the
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:03.880]   earth, will draw all men unto me. I cannot deal with other nations until I have died."
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.800]   What is this lifted up from the earth? Well, this, he said, signifying what death he should
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:15.520]   die. He says, "You know, until they have nailed me on a tree and have raised up that tree,
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:23.280]   until I hang there dying, I cannot draw men from all nations unto myself. But when I am
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.840]   lifted up, I will draw men from all nations unto myself. Greeks then, as well as Jews,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.040]   all nations, it does not matter who they are, I am the saviour of the world, but that is
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.240]   the way, it is the only way. If, when, I am lifted up, and it is the only way in which
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:48.560]   I can do it." Well now, there is his statement. But, says somebody, I do not understand this.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:55.080]   Why is it that he can only save men by dying? Isn't his example enough? Isn't his teaching
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:59.320]   enough? If the whole world only accepted it tonight, wouldn't the whole world be transformed?
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.200]   I know, but the whole world can't do that, and it won't do that. The teaching has been
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.160]   before them all the centuries, but they won't practice it. What's the matter? Why must he
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:13.320]   die? Here's the question. He says he must. Why? Let me give you his own answers to the
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:24.280]   question. The first thing that I find him saying is this, in verse 31, "Now is the
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:32.960]   judgment of this world." Now, his death, what's just about to happen to him, his being
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.920]   lifted up on the cross, that, he says, is in connection with the judgment of this world.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:48.560]   What's he mean? Why is his death absolutely essential? Oh, because of judgment. What judgment?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:36:03.000]   The judgment of God. Here's the answer. The judgment of God upon sin. God hates sin. And
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.160]   God has said from the beginning that he will punish everyone who sins. He said to men when
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.760]   he put him in a perfect state in the garden, "If you eat of that fruit, dying, you shall
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:20.440]   die. You'll be driven out of the garden. You'll bear the consequences." That's judgment upon
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:27.160]   sin. And that is what God has announced in the Ten Commandments, given through Moses,
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:37.280]   in all the moral law, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." God's judgment upon sin. Here's
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.880]   the problem. And it is because of this that he has got to die. He says, "My death is in
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:49.200]   connection with this judgment of God upon sin and evil." Now, you remember, oh, the
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:55.880]   Apostle Paul expounds all that in writing to the Romans. He says, "I am not ashamed
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.360]   of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.160]   to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:12.840]   from heaven, as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.'" Why is he so proud
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.560]   of it? For this reason, "For the wrath of God is already revealed from heaven upon all
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:26.080]   ungodliness and all unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:32.200]   Now is the judgment of this world. Now God is going to show what he thinks of sin. God
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.160]   is going to show that sin must be punished, that his holy nature must punish it. The world
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.880]   is to be punished because it doesn't know God. The world is to be punished because it
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.800]   didn't recognize his Son. When he sent him into the world, the world didn't recognize
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:57.320]   him. It rejected him, and this is the judgment that comes upon it. God is a punisher of sin.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:05.120]   And the wrath of God is going to be poured out upon sin. That's why he must die. The
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.400]   second thing he says is this, "Now is the prince of this world cast out." What does
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:19.240]   this mean? Well, here's another important metaphor. "The world ever since men fell
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:27.320]   into sin has been in the power of the devil. Up until this very time with which we are
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.360]   dealing, there was only one single race and nation in the world that really believed in
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:38.320]   the only true God, and that was the Jews. All the other nations of the world believed
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:44.080]   in their various gods and demons and other things. Why? It was the devil who held them
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:52.280]   in blindness. And the Israelites hadn't discovered this themselves, it was God who
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.640]   revealed it to them. He called the men of the name of Abram and given them a revelation.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:03.320]   He was brought up in a pagan atmosphere. God revealed himself to him, and he kept on giving
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:09.240]   this unique revelation to this people and to this people alone. The Jews, all the other
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:18.600]   nations were held blind by Satan, who is therefore the prince of this world. And what our Lord
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:25.120]   is saying here is this, that as the result of his death, the devil will no longer be
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.240]   able to keep the nations of the world in this blindness and in this ignorance. And that,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.480]   as you know, is something that has happened historically ever since. From this moment,
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.520]   the other nations begin to come to God, and they come through Christ. Never before here
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.240]   the prince of this world is cast out. And he's no longer been able to hold all the
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:54.520]   nations in the blindness and the darkness and the ignorance of sin about God. It literally
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.840]   happened. Our Lord is prophesying it here. He says that by his death and resurrection,
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.880]   the devil will be utterly defeated. The devil will be routed. His power over nations, his
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:11.760]   power over death, will come to an end. Christ, by dying and rising again, is going to bring
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.200]   life and immortality to light through the gospel.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:25.880]   Now then, the two great problems facing mankind, you see, are these. The judgment of God upon
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:33.960]   sin. We've all sinned and come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous,
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.120]   no, not one. We, none of us, have loved God as we ought. We've none of us served him.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   We've all done things that are utterly reprehensible. We are all sinners, and God's wrath is upon
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.280]   us all by nature. We need to be delivered from the judgment of God. And then there's
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.160]   the power of the devil over us all by nature, the strong man armed that keepeth his goods
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.800]   in peace. How can we get away from him? We've tried and we've failed. There are the two
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.480]   problems. He says, "I'm going to solve it." He says he's come into the world
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.320]   in order to solve it. And his way of solving it is by dying upon the cross. Well, how does
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:18.800]   he do it? How does the death of Christ achieve these two things? And he tells us here quite
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.880]   plainly, "What does this death mean? What is this death that is so absolutely essential?"
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:36.440]   Listen to him speaking. "Here he cries out in a kind of agony, 'Now is my soul troubled!'"
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:45.200]   What shall I say? "Father, save me out of this hour." What's it mean, my friend?
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:53.040]   Have you ever considered this? Do you understand? His soul is in trouble, not his mind only,
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:00.200]   but his soul, his innermost being. What's the matter? Why is he, as it were, shrinking
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.840]   from this hour, this death upon the cross? It's a terrible thing. His soul is in an
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:11.960]   agony, he says. Why? "Oh," says somebody, "isn't that just a natural fear of death?
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.560]   There's nothing wrong in being afraid of death." No, my friend, it isn't sufficient.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.280]   It isn't a fear of pain, it isn't a fear of death. There have been many men in this
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.800]   world who have been able to smile in the face of death. They didn't shrink from pain,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:30.520]   they didn't shrink from death, they didn't ask God to save them from it, but he does.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:43.920]   Why? What's the explanation? And there's only one answer. This is what his death means.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:51.000]   This is what happened. He was innocent, he'd never sinned. Nobody could charge him with
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   anything. Well, then why does he shrink from death? I'll tell you. This is what killed
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:07.400]   him. This is the meaning of his death. He takes upon him your sins and mine. He makes
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:13.680]   himself responsible for. He makes himself responsible for your guilt, for my guilt,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.880]   the guilt that we have because we've sinned against God, positively and negatively. We
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.160]   haven't worshipped him, we haven't praised him, we haven't kept his laws, we've deliberately
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.840]   broken them, and we are under that wrath of God, we are guilty sinners. Now he takes that
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.880]   guilt upon himself, he makes himself responsible, it's on him, and he knew what it was going
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:42.400]   to mean. It meant this. That covered with your guilt and mine, he no longer is able
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:49.320]   to look into the face of his father. He is the everlasting Son of God, and he'd always
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.840]   eternally looked into the face and into the eyes of God. There had never been anything
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:44:01.200]   between them. But now his sin comes upon him, our sin comes upon him, and it comes between
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   him and his father. And that's the thing he doesn't want. It's the only thing he
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:11.360]   ever asked to avoid, to be separated from his father. That's why he went through that
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.200]   agony in the garden and began to sweat drops of blood. That's why he cried out on the
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:24.600]   cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He knew what was coming. This is the
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:31.000]   meaning of this hour. He knew that as he became responsible for our sins, the wrath of God
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.960]   against sin would come upon him, and he'd feel it in all its agony. He'd feel the pains
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:45.960]   of hell, separation from God. But nevertheless, he goes on with it. He says, "No, I'm
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:51.840]   not going to offer the prayer to be delivered from it. Father, glorify thy name. Thy will
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:57.920]   be done, not mine." He gave himself, and it happened to him, and he was smitten, stricken
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:08.760]   of God. The chastisement of our peace fell upon him. And that is the meaning of his death.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:19.520]   And you see, that is how he delivers us. He has borne God's wrath against the sin of
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:27.080]   whoever believes in him. That's your first problem, the judgment. How can you stand in
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:34.640]   the judgment? How can you stand before God in his utter, indescribable holiness, clad
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:41.560]   with your guilt and the rags of your sin? How can you do it? You can't do it. The judgment
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:47.280]   of God will fall upon you, and you'll die everlastingly outside the presence of God.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:55.120]   But if you believe in the death of the Son of God for your sins, it'll all be removed.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.280]   He said himself, you'll find it in the fifth chapter of this Gospel of John, in verse 24,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.760]   "Whosoever believeth in me," he says, "hath everlasting life," he's got it now, "and
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:15.680]   shall not come unto death; he is already passed from judgment unto life." His death was the
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:21.560]   judgment upon your sin, if you believe in him. He delivers you from the judgment of
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:28.080]   God upon the sin of the whole race. Not only that, he delivers you from the bondage and
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:33.840]   the tyranny of the devil, because mankind is only under the bondage and the tyranny
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:39.120]   and the serfdom of the devil, because it is not being blessed by God. And when man is
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.520]   not blessed by God, he is helpless against the devil. And before we can ever be delivered
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.680]   from the devil's power, we must be right with God and blessed with God. He's done
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:55.760]   it. By reconciling us to God, he at the same time delivers us from the tyranny and the
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.920]   bondage of the devil. That is what the Lord himself, this same person, said to the apostle
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.920]   Paul, you remember, on the road to Damascus? He said, "Now, having shown you myself and
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.160]   the truth, I want to send you to these people, the Jews, and to the nations, to turn them
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:21.640]   from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God." It's the only way.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:28.280]   It is Christ by dying who has purchased for us the blessing of God and has delivered us
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:34.040]   out of the clutches of the Satan and hell and has transferred us into his own glorious
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:39.800]   kingdom. Oh yes, by dying upon the cross, he defeated the devil. The devil thought he
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.960]   was clever. He thought he'd encompassed his end, he'd finished him. He worked in the
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:50.520]   minds of the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and the Roman governor and everybody else.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.200]   If we only get rid of him, then we are conquerors. But you see, by killing him they defeated
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.360]   themselves. He can't be kept in the grave. He bursts us under the bands of death. He
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:05.480]   roars triumphantly over the grave and the devil is defeated in his last act. He's been
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:11.360]   bruised once and forever and it's but a matter of time before he will be finally cast into
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.960]   the lake of perdition. That's why he must die. Except the corn and wheat fall into the
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   ground and die, it abideth alone. If he hadn't died in this way, he'd be nothing but a Jewish
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:29.880]   teacher, one of the great religious teachers of all times, but no more. But having died,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:37.960]   he's Savior. He delivers from the judgment and the wrath of God against sin. He sets
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   us free from the power and the clutches of sin and of Satan. That is the second absolute
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.200]   essential condition to knowing him truly. And I just say a word about the last. It is
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:49:02.360]   this. It is that you and I realize why he had to do all that for us and that we trust
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:08.080]   in him and in him alone and submit ourselves completely to him. Let me just give you the
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:15.200]   headings. The first is this. If you want to know the Lord Jesus Christ as you are Savior,
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:22.160]   the first thing you've got to understand is the true nature of your life in this world
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:30.040]   as you are by nature. He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:38.800]   in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. Now, my friend, here's the practical matter.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.400]   You see, it's all this question of why do you want to come to Christ at all? Why do
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.640]   you desire to see Jesus? Is it because you want to enlarge your mental outlook a little?
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.480]   Is it because you want a little help in your political campaign or whatever it may be?
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.720]   Is that it? Well, you might as well stay at home. You'll never know him. This is what
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.200]   he says. Have you seen the nature of life in this world? Have you seen it's something
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.120]   to be hated? Have you seen it's evil? Have you seen it's under the wrath and the condemnation
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:11.920]   of God? Have you seen that it's vile? If you haven't, you've got nothing. You must start
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.880]   by realizing the character of your life in this world, that it's something hateful, something
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   utterly different from what God originally made and planned. Secondly, you've got to
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:30.880]   realize, my friend, that the one thing that matters is your soul. He that loveth his life
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.040]   If you really want to know this person as your savior, well then you've got to realize
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.880]   that your big problem is the salvation of your soul, not just the preservation of your
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.400]   body, but the salvation of your soul. You're frightened of death. You don't want to go
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.240]   out of this life. You're having such a good time. You want to postpone it as long as you
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.160]   can. You're against war, therefore. But you're thinking of the wrong question. It's your
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:05.880]   soul. Don't you see that the value of your soul is so great that you must be ready to
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:10.400]   die, he says, rather than lose this? It's another way of saying, "What shall it profit
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.960]   a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" He says, "This is how you
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.640]   must come." The Greeks hadn't known anything about this. They were standing on their feet
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.360]   with their politeness. Sir, we would see Jesus, but a woman in the depths of sin and in the
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.600]   gutter knows she's lost, and she clings to him. He is the only one who can cleanse me,
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:36.520]   and so with all of them. Have you come as realizing that your soul is lost, that you're
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.480]   a sinner, that you can't save yourself, that you're vile, and that you're unclean? That's
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:47.760]   the way to come, he says, realizing the value of your immortal soul, and realizing it to
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:53.280]   this extent, that rather than lose this, you'd lose everything, life itself, in order that
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:00.720]   this might be saved. Do you approach Jesus Christ like that? It's absolutely essential.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:07.120]   Then he goes on to say that we must serve him. "If any man serve me, let him follow
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:15.000]   me, and where I am, there shall also my servant be. If any man serve me, him will my Father
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.320]   honor." Are you being honored by God? Are you a child of God? Do you know your life's
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:29.160]   in the hands of God? Oh, this is the supreme thing. There's only one way to get it. Serve
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:37.320]   Christ. Which means this. Become his slave. Submit yourself to him. Stop standing up and
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.200]   questioning him. Stop examining him and coming to your decisions and conclusions concerning
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:48.640]   him. Fall at his feet, men. Do like the woman did in sin. Fall at his feet. Hold on to the
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:54.840]   hem of his garment. Become desperate and realize that he and he alone can save you, that he's
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:00.720]   even died in order that he might do it. Begin to take the communion, the bread and the wine,
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:06.920]   because you say, "Here alone can I be saved. Here alone can I be saved from the judgment
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:12.720]   of God and delivered from the devil. He and he alone can save me, and he's done it by
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:20.680]   dying. Serve me." Submit to him. Surrender your life to him. And then go after him, follow
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:29.040]   him. "If any man serve me, let him follow me." Deny yourself, take up the cross and
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:38.080]   follow him. If you really have seen this truth, if you have seen that your soul is lost, that
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:42.160]   you don't know God, that you're under the judgment of God, and that you can do nothing
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:49.520]   about it, well, then you'll not only believe that Christ died for you, the Son of God,
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.400]   but you'll follow him. You'll let the world laugh at you, if it likes. You'll let your
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.280]   family even be annoyed with you. You'll say, "This comes first. Yes, before my wife, my
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.920]   children, my husband, here is everything, my soul. I'll go after him. I'll serve him.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:10.400]   I'll follow him. Let him lead me where he wills. I'll even die for him rather than
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.800]   deny him." And you know, the first Christians did. The Roman authorities came to them and
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:21.120]   said, "You mustn't say that Jesus is Lord. There's no Lord but Caesar. Say Caesar is
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.200]   Lord." "No," they said. "If you don't say it," said the authorities, "we'll throw you
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.720]   to the lions in the arena." "Very well," they said. "Do what you will with us. But we can
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:40.600]   only say this, Jesus, and he alone, is the Lord. He's the Savior. He's the Redeemer.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:47.760]   He is the Lord of the universe. And I follow him, come what may, even into the very jaws
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:58.000]   of death itself." There, my dear friend, are the three essential
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.160]   conditions to coming to know him as your Savior and as your Redeemer. The Greeks knew nothing
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:15.600]   about any one of them. Do you? There's only one way to know him as your Savior, Redeemer,
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:23.160]   and Lord, and to enjoy the benefits and the blessings. To be a partaker of that much fruit
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:32.320]   of which he speaks. It is this, that you just fall helplessly at his feet in the agony of
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:45.880]   your soul and say this, "Just as I am, without one plea. I don't bring my learning. I don't
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.880]   bring my knowledge. I don't bring all the good I've ever done. I don't bring my morality.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:56:00.480]   I don't bring my character. Just as I am, without one plea, but that thy blood was shed
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:09.880]   for me and that thou bidst me come to thee. O Lamb of God, I come." And if you come like
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:15.600]   that, you'll have a wonderful reception. He'll reveal his love to you. He'll give you an
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:21.960]   assurance if you ask him that he has died for you, that you've passed from judgment
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:30.080]   to life, and that he'll move you from the kingdom of Satan into his own dear kingdom.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:37.840]   And you'll walk in his light of life until the end, and then enter finally to be with
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:46.040]   him in the glory, having the Father to honor you. "Where I am," he says, "there ye shall
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:55.120]   be also." My dear friend, learn the lesson taught us by the incident of the Greeks who
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:05.320]   came and said, "Sir, we would see Jesus." Learn the lesson. Don't come in that way.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:13.520]   Come in the way that he himself indicates, and thereby be saved and enter into the joy
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.560]   of the Lord. Amen.
