[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Do you think there will always be evil in the world?
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.840]   Do you think there will always be war?
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.280]   Unfortunately yes.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.040]   There are conflicting interests, conflicting goals that people have.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.440]   Most of the time those conflicts can be resolved peacefully.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.800]   That's why we build strong institutions, to resolve different interests and conflicts
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.600]   peacefully.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:38.680]   But the fact, the enduring fact of conflicting interests and conflicting desires, that can
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.120]   never be changed.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:50.560]   So the job that we have for humanity's sake is to make those conflicting interests, those
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:59.400]   conflicting desires, to put them in a context where they can be resolved peacefully and
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.080]   not in a zero-sum fashion.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   So we can't get there on the global scale.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.560]   So there's always going to be the kind of conflict that sometimes gets violent.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.760]   What we don't want is a conflict among the strongest powers.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.720]   Great power conflict is unbelievably bad.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.800]   There are no words to describe it.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.400]   At least 55 million people died in World War II.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.560]   If we have a World War III, a war between the United States and China or whatever it
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.360]   might be, who knows what the number could be.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.160]   A hundred and fifty-five million, two hundred and fifty-five million, five hundred and fifty-five
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160]   million.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.480]   I don't even want to think about it.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.600]   And so it's horrible when wars break out in the humanitarian catastrophes.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.760]   For example, Yemen and Syria and several other places I could name today.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.120]   It's just horrible what you see there.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.540]   And the scale is colossal for those places.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.140]   But it's not planetary scale.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.480]   And so avoiding planetary scale destruction is really important for us.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.600]   And so having those different interests be somehow managed in a way that they don't,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.880]   that no one sees advantage in a violent resolution.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240]   And a part of that is remembering history.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.520]   So they should read your books.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.020]   [END]
