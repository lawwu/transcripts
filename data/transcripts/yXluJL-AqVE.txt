[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   We close out the week with two important questions
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.920]   we commonly receive on the topic of marital intimacy.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.120]   And they are, of course, intended for a mature audience.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.100]   The first question comes from Kyle in Kansas City.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.200]   He has a follow-up question.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.000]   Dear Pastor John, my question is a follow-up
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   to episode number 475.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.120]   Is sexual attraction essential for marriage?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.840]   There you said no.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.600]   So if sexual attraction is not essential to marriage,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.720]   why does it seem so essential to the Song of Solomon?
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800]   It sure wouldn't be much of a song
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.120]   if you took out everything in it
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.720]   that has to do with physical pleasure, now would it?
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.320]   Pastor John, what do you have to say
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.280]   to Kyle from Kansas City?
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.400]   So let's clarify the question I was answering.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.240]   I mean, that's true.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.720]   Yeah, all right, good question.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.840]   Let's clarify what I was answering.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.320]   The question I was answering was not, is sex essential?
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.200]   But is sexual attraction essential for marriage?
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.480]   I answered no for cultural reason and physical reasons.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.800]   Culturally and historically, lots of true marriages
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.560]   have been put together by parents
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.800]   without the physical desire being there at the beginning
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.400]   for the couple, arranged marriages.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   Physically, there are seasons of life as you grow older
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.800]   where those pleasures rise and fall, come and go.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.400]   If you said that sexual attraction were the essence,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.160]   then aging would be the gradual end of marriage,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.960]   which it isn't.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   Some of the greatest glories, I think,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   happen in marriage in the absence of sexual desire.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.080]   So let's clarify then what I am saying
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   and what I'm not saying when I say sexual pleasure
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.680]   is not part of the essence of marriage.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   What I'm saying is that marriage really exists without it.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.080]   The absence of pleasure in sexual relations
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.720]   does not make a marriage no longer a marriage.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.120]   The Bible mandate for sexual relations is there,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.080]   1 Corinthians 7, 3,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   but even lengthy interruptions do not turn marriage
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.840]   into something other than marriage,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.120]   as when a husband or wife is in prison for 10, 20 years,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   or when seafarers went on a two-year whaling expedition.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.800]   That's what I am saying.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   Marriage is still marriage when pleasures rise and fall,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.040]   can be expressed, cannot be expressed,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.120]   or when they completely disappear,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.600]   which happens sometimes for purely physiological reasons.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.560]   A real marriage, indeed a happy one,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.400]   can exist when those pleasures are not part of the joy.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.760]   Now what I'm not saying,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.000]   and this is what Kyle picked up on, I hope.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.160]   I mean, he may not have picked up on it.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.560]   Now I hope he will.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   What I'm not saying is that the Song of Solomon
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.840]   can be the Song of Solomon without sexual pleasure.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.960]   The Song of Solomon, he said,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.440]   wouldn't be much of a song if you took out everything in it
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.000]   that has to do with sexual pleasure.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.760]   That is absolutely right.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   It is an utterly sensual song.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.920]   It is a lavish celebration of God's gift
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.840]   of sexual pleasure in marriage.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.280]   I'm glad it's in the Bible.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   So what I'm not saying is,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.280]   if something is not essential to marriage,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   it can't be hugely important and spectacularly wonderful.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.680]   Too many negatives in that sentence.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.880]   Let me try again.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.760]   I'll say it this way.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   If something is not essential to marriage,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.700]   it may still be hugely important
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.820]   and spectacularly wonderful.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.840]   So Kyle is right.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.760]   If you take away sexual pleasure from the Song of Solomon,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.640]   it is no longer a celebration of sexual pleasure.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.520]   And I'm not in any way commending
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.080]   pleasure absent sexual relations.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.500]   I regard such experiences as a very sad reality
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.920]   that some must live with.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.460]   The loss of sexual pleasure in marriage is not the ideal.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.560]   It's not the goal.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.000]   In fact, let's take it a little further.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Since God designed marriage in its one flesh union
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.440]   to be a parable, a drama of his relationship to the church
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.400]   and the church to him,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.080]   the absence of deeply loving pleasure
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.520]   in the act of one flesh union
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.240]   is less than the complete drama
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.120]   of the intensity of the joy between Christ and his church.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.360]   I mean, it is amazing to me to think
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   that God knew exactly what he was doing
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.600]   in creating sex as part of marriage
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.960]   and all of its exquisite pleasures.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.160]   And he had in mind Christ in the church
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.320]   when he did it back in the beginning.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.520]   We know that from Ephesians 5, 32 and so on.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.080]   So even though marriage can exist without this pleasure,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.960]   yes, it can, it's not of the essence,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   nevertheless, the fullest and most complete portrayal
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.920]   of the ultimate meaning of marriage
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.440]   is not possible without that pleasure.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.040]   You can have a real marriage
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   that is an imperfect portrayal of Christ and his church.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.320]   But Song of Solomon is right
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.480]   to celebrate sexual pleasure in marriage
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.040]   because one of the reasons
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.960]   that sexual pleasure in marriage is so wonderful
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.440]   and so important is because it completes the picture
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.920]   of how intense the pleasures of knowing Christ
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.640]   will be forever.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.160]   So conclusion, no, it's not essential,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   but yes, staggeringly important and wonderful.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.640]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.360]   and thank you for the follow-up question, Kyle.
