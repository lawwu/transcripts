[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   You just got paid, but now what do you do? Do you move money to savings, invest, pay down debt,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.020]   or just let it sit there and hope for the best? Most people kind of wing it. And even if you're
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.240]   earning good money, that leads to second guessing, missed opportunities, and financial stress that
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.700]   doesn't need to be there. So in this video, I'm going to walk you through the exact 10-step
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.960]   framework I use every time I get paid so you can stop guessing, start optimizing, and make your
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.700]   money work smarter. And this isn't just about paying off debt or building an emergency fund.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.320]   I'm also going to cover advanced tactics that are sometimes contrarian for investing,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.020]   managing liquidity, and creating real financial flexibility. So let's get into it.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.240]   So the first step in how I allocate money is what I'll call operating cash, which involves making
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.500]   sure you have one to two months of your regular expenses sitting in cash, right in your checking
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.140]   account. Or for those of you who listen to episode 177 on the best bank account setup,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.700]   I actually think the best accounts are ones that you can earn interest on. And in most cases,
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.860]   those are actually savings or cash management accounts that function like a checking account.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.600]   So go check out that episode if you want my recommendations for where to put this money.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.220]   But this is not an emergency fund. This is not a giant amount of money to solve all these problems.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.400]   It's your cash flow buffer for each month to smooth over the gap between the fact that sometimes
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.280]   you have bills that are due before your income hits, and you want to make sure you're not having to go
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.620]   borrow money, transfer money when that happens. It also means because it's one to two months that
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.380]   there is a small buffer for some urgent thing like a high health insurance deductible, a sudden car
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.260]   repair. You want to be able to cover those things without having to dip into your savings or borrow
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.240]   money. So this is your pay your bills. Don't get caught off guard fund. It's simple. It's boring,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.700]   but it's probably the most practical and essential piece of your framework for how you allocate your
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.860]   money. So if you don't currently have one to two months in an account, this is where I would
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.720]   prioritize putting those funds. And just to be clear, if you're not doing this exactly like me,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.400]   that's okay. If you already have money in other places, I'm not saying go ahead quickly and sell off your
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.860]   stocks or withdraw the money from your retirement fund to follow this order. But I do think that as you have
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.820]   incremental savings, this is the order in which I would prioritize putting my own money in different
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.880]   places before I start saving and investing. Okay. After that cash buffer is in place, the next
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.980]   absolute priority, in my opinion, is the employer match. If your company is matching your retirement
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.840]   contributions, whether that's in a 401k, a 403b, or any type of account, even if they're only matching
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.680]   some amount of investment and not the entire amount, right? Sometimes they might match the first
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180]   thousand dollars of your 401k contributions. If you're getting a hundred percent match, meaning you put
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.300]   in a thousand and the employer puts in a thousand, that's a guaranteed 100% return on your investment.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.520]   And it's immediate. You don't have to wait a period of time. There is no debt payoff, no investment,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.840]   no savings account that can compete with doubling your money instantly. This is also true if they
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.040]   match your HSA contribution or your FSA contributions or anything like that. And really the only time I'd
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.340]   skip this employer match is if you have really crushing high interest debt, like 15, 20, 25, 30%,
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.960]   and your match is really small that it's not worth focusing on until you can get that debt paid off.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.940]   Otherwise, skipping an employer match is like saying no thanks to free money, which if you've
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.180]   listened long enough, you know I would never want to say. All right, once you've got your match set up,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.720]   if you have it, right? I work for myself. I don't have an employer match, so I skip number two.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.700]   But then I like to allocate money towards what I'll call urgent debt payoff,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.440]   which is generally paying down any high interest debt, typically above around 8%.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.700]   Now, why do I pick 8%? Well, that's roughly the long-term after-tax return of the stock market.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.780]   You might decide that this number for you is 7% or 9%. You can tweak it as you see fit,
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.340]   and it may fluctuate a little bit with interest rates or your current situation.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.800]   But if you're carrying credit card balances, have personal loans, medical loans,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.000]   or some older student loans that are in really high interest rates,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.260]   paying them off is like getting a market-level return, except you don't have the risk of the
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.280]   market. So instead of accumulating, let's say on average 8% in the stock market, you're actually
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.000]   going to not pay 8% interest. But in the stock market, that money might not make 8%. It might go
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.060]   down this year. This is guaranteed because you're paying that debt off, and you're stopping the
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.340]   interest payments immediately. Now, if you're juggling multiple debts that are at this amount,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.260]   there are a few different ways to decide the order to pay them off. I care much less about which one
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.180]   and more that you pick one, stay with it, and then move on to the next one. I personally like what I
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.480]   think is called the avalanche method, which is you start with the highest interest first. It's going
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.080]   to reduce the amount of interest you pay the fastest. But there's an alternative method called the
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.500]   snowball method, where you start with the smallest balance first. I know that's more motivating for
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.720]   some people. But like I said, whatever works for you is great. But I'd much prefer to be paying off
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.200]   high interest debt than investing my money, because I'm going to get a better ROI with more certainty.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.020]   Now that the urgent stuff is handled, it's time to build your safety net. I know this is often called
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.120]   an emergency fund. I've called it that in the past. But I think it's for a lot more things than just
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.880]   emergencies. So that's why I like to call it a safety net and think of it as a broader thing.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.840]   No matter what you call it, it is usually an extra three to nine months of your monthly expenses.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.600]   It could be more. And I want to put those somewhere that earns in today's interest rates at least four
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.220]   percent with very little risk. It could be high yield savings. It could be a brokerage account in
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.820]   treasuries, something similar, but somewhere where there's no risk and you're earning interest.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.180]   Now, this is your cushion for any big life disruptions. Could be a layoff, could be a health
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.020]   crisis, could be a major home repair or car repair. I don't know what it is in your circumstance, but
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.780]   you want to make sure you have something to cover it. Now, how much you need depends on a few key
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.860]   things. First, do you have any dependents? If so, I like to increase my safety net. Job stability.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.980]   Depending on how stable your income is or how volatile the industry you work in is, you might want to
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.120]   increase or decrease your safety net accordingly. I know some people that have jobs where they feel
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.780]   like they are certain forever. They have very little risk that they'd ever lose them. Maybe you're a
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.040]   tenured professor and so they feel a lot more comfortable. Other people might work at a startup
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.680]   or work in an industry that's getting quickly disrupted. In that case, I'd want a much bigger
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.740]   safety net. Similarly, when it comes to income replacement, you want to consider how hard it might
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.880]   be to replace your income. If you're in a highly specialized field or you're in a really senior or
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.440]   executive role, even though that industry might be working and it's not necessarily a volatile industry,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.980]   it might take you a longer time to find a new job because you want to find the right place. You want
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.420]   to find the right fit. You might have to move. You might have to talk to lots of companies. You might
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.060]   have to wait for those roles to open up. And so I'd like to have more of a safety net in those
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.560]   circumstances. Next is how many sources of income you have in your household. If you're a single income
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.840]   household, I'd skew on the higher end of a safety net. If you have two or three or more sources of
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.400]   income for your house, your family, you could probably go a lot lower. And then last is your
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.220]   risk tolerance. That matters because if you sleep better at night knowing that you have a bigger safety
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.440]   net, that's a totally valid reason to increase it. So in summary, if you had no dependents, a very
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.180]   stable job that would be easy to replace, and in your household there's two or three different sources
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.700]   of income, and you have a lot of risk tolerance, maybe three months is fine. Maybe you don't need a big
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:32.840]   safety net. But if you have all those things, dependents, unstable job, volatile industry, hard to replace
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.980]   your income, and only one source of income in your household, and maybe you're risk averse, I would be
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.900]   skewing towards nine, 12, or maybe even more months of expenses as a safety net. And if you're the kind of
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.160]   person that would really like a formula to figure out the exact number, Brian Feraldi, one of my past guests,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.140]   actually has a framework for this that has a series of questions to help you arrive at a number,
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:59.460]   I'll put a link to that in the show notes. For someone like us, we've got two kids, both of us
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.100]   are self-employed at the same company. I'm probably skewing a little bit more towards nine or 12 months
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.060]   with our safety net right now. And keep in mind, and if after hearing this, you realize you don't have
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.880]   the safety net you want, you don't necessarily need to get there overnight. Sure, if you already have
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.660]   these funds set aside, that would be great. But I wouldn't say go sell retirement accounts and pay
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.480]   penalties to do it. If you're actively saving, this can be a goal that you save for over time.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.960]   And if you're thinking, wow, so you want me to do all of this before investing any of my money into
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.140]   my 401k or brokerage account. That is correct. I know that seems crazy to some, but my rationale here
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.720]   is that if you're going to need these funds in case you lose your job, you don't want to have to sell
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.080]   your investments or pay penalties to withdraw them to do it. Especially if the market's down when that
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.120]   happens, which unfortunately often happens around the same time as many companies do layoffs.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.300]   So yes, I am saying that I like to set up this safety net before I'm in a situation where I'm
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.280]   saving for the longterm. This episode is brought to you by Viore, which is amazing because they are one

[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.040]   goals fund. Now, this is different from your emergency fund because it's for expected expenses. But like
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:37.340]   your emergency fund, I keep it in the same type of liquid and low-risk investments. And I say investments,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.860]   but more often than not, it's a high-yield savings account where it's in a brokerage account but stored
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:47.900]   in something like a treasury money market fund or actually buying treasuries or a treasury ETF or just
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:54.520]   something low-fee, easy liquidity, but still earning four or more percent right now in today's market.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.920]   I'm recording this at the end of June. Who knows what happens in the future? Now, why did I say five
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.320]   years? You could invest this money in the stock market. That'd be totally fine. The long-term expected
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.500]   returns are going to be greater than you're going to get from a high-yield savings account.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.680]   However, the market drops. That's just something that happens. And you don't want to be in a situation
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.540]   where you're saving up for a down payment. And the point in time you want to buy your home,
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.560]   the market's down 20% or 30%. And that's the time you need to take your money out.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.920]   So I like to keep this money in a place that is separate from my long-term investing.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.520]   That said, if my goals were 10, 20 years from now, you want a down payment someday,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.040]   day, but it hasn't really entered in that next five-year window. Absolutely. I'd be investing
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.340]   that in a different way. But for short-term goals, this is what I'm doing. Also, you want to consider
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.600]   the cost of not having this cash, right? So let's say you're trying to make a down payment and you
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.280]   don't have this accessible. You might be paying PMI, which is a type of insurance that you have to pay
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.820]   if your down payment is too small, or you might have to borrow at really high interest rates.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.940]   Sometimes the best way you can earn on your money is actually avoiding debt in the future,
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.120]   which is why I like to make sure I have all my short-term goals funded and saved in cash
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.340]   before they happen. Okay. After your goals are covered, I think it's time to do what I'll call
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.060]   a debt review. And the target right now for what I typically would think about paying off is in that
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.960]   six to 8% range. And it's a little tricky because the rates are a little borderline. They're higher
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.520]   than what you typically are on your cash, probably close to what you'd earn on investing, maybe a
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.740]   little less. And there's some other factors that might apply. So here's my rule of thumb.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.540]   If the debt isn't tax deductible, right? So there are certain types of debt like mortgages or maybe
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.020]   investment interest, maybe even related to student loans, where you're actually going to get a tax
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.280]   savings for the interest you pay on that debt. So I think you should look at the interest rates on,
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.460]   I'll call it like a tax adjusted basis, right? If you have a 6% mortgage,
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.880]   mortgage, but that mortgage interest is tax deductible, and you live in a high tax state,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.420]   and you make a lot of money, it might really be more like 3% or 4%. You have to do your own math
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.740]   related to your own tax brackets. But if you have a loan, and it's at, let's call it 7.5%,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.760]   we'll call it a used car loan. I would lean towards paying that off at this point. Now,
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.880]   when you look at paying off this debt, and you compare it to some of the short term goals I talked
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.940]   about in the previous step, I think you could make a case depending on the timeframe of how soon they are,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.860]   that it might make sense to pay off the debt first, you're obviously going to be earning
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:28.280]   more by paying off 7.5% debt than by putting money aside earning 4%. But depending on the type of loan
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.480]   that you have, it might be very difficult for you to be able to get that money again, if you need it.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.900]   So for example, let's say you had a 7.5% student loan, and you're trying to make a down payment,
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.660]   and you want to set aside some money. Well, yes, you could pay that student loan off,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:48.340]   and you'd effectively be getting a 7.5% return. Let's assume there's no deductibility on the interest.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.140]   But now that you've paid it off, let's say you actually need that money for some other purpose,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.300]   one of those short term goals. Well, you might not be able to borrow at 7.5% now.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.700]   Maybe you have to go take out a personal loan, or maybe you have to put it on a credit card with a
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.200]   20% interest rate. And so you want to weigh how soon that goal is and what alternative ways you
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.340]   have to fund it or delay it if you pay that debt off first. Now, just to be clear, I'm not anti-debt.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.100]   I don't think you should pay off all debt, but I am anti-debt when the math doesn't work out over
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.680]   other types of investments. Okay, now let's talk about investing. We've got the high interest debt
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.440]   covered, we've got our safety net and short-term goals funded, and it's time to start building real
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.160]   long-term wealth. And the thing I like to start with here is tax-advantaged investing.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.100]   Now, many of these things will be very dependent on your employer and what types of accounts you
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.380]   have access to, your current income tax bracket, and even your health insurance plan in the case
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:45.240]   of an HSA. So I can't give a one-size-fits-all answer. However, when I think about tax-advantaged
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:53.020]   accounts, I'm thinking mostly about IRAs, 401Ks, 403Bs, but my favorite is probably the Roth IRA and
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:59.600]   the HSA. And that's because they offer a ton of flexibility, really low fees, because you can house them,
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.000]   usually at a brokerage account of your choosing, and some of the best investment options. And on
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.880]   the HSA side, you've got the triple tax deduction of being able to put money in tax-free, being able to
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.680]   put it in tax-free, being able to take it out tax-free, and being able to have it grow tax-free.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.820]   So it's an amazing account. And on the Roth IRA side, I know many people don't think that they
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.980]   might be eligible because of their income or their workplace retirement plans. I'd encourage you to go
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.440]   look into a backdoor Roth IRA contribution, which is something that is kind of a workaround that the
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.400]   IRS has finally signed off on, if you will. And it's something I do every year. And so take a look at
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.580]   that as a way to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA, even if you're not directly eligible. After the
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:47.080]   Roth IRA and the HSA, I'm looking at 401ks, 403bs, solo 401ks, maybe a SEP IRA, anything that you have
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:54.520]   access to with low fees, good investment options is a really great place to start saving in a tax
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.300]   advantaged way. If you don't have good investment options, or you have a 401k at work with really high
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.820]   fees, I'd probably make the argument that the tax savings aren't worth it. And after you've used an
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.080]   employer match, if you have one, it might be better to just put your money in a taxable brokerage account
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.200]   where you have a lot more control. And if you're a high earner, and you're saving a lot of money each
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.880]   year, definitely look at your 401k plan if you have one, and see if you have the ability to make after
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:25.620]   tax contributions and roll them out into a Roth IRA. It's called a mega backdoor Roth contribution,
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:31.460]   and actually has a limit each year of up to $70,000. So you could put a lot more money than you might be
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:37.400]   thinking into your tax advantaged retirement accounts. If you want to go really deep on tax
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.900]   advantaged accounts, this is not it. I did a really deep dive episode number 144. Go check that out.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.800]   The reason I give the numbers is because you can either scroll through till you find the number or
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.680]   just go to allthehacks.com slash 144. And it'll redirect you to the page, which has links to the
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.420]   episode in different podcast players, and it should jump right to that episode.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.880]   Now, the obvious downside of putting your money in these tax advantaged accounts is that you're kind
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.600]   of locking your money up until retirement. And to take it out early often comes with taxes and fees
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.900]   or penalties. But the tax advantage really can add up over decades. So it's important to make sure that
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.940]   you do have your money set aside for short term goals before putting your money here, because you
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.640]   don't want to have to pay those penalties and fees for a wedding down payment or any other major expenses,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.700]   because it will completely negate all the tax advantage of putting money in. That said, even if
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.420]   you knew you were going to have to take all your retirement money out, and your employer was offering
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.460]   a match, I would still take advantage of that match, putting no regard to whether you're going to leave
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.460]   that money in forever, because it's still going to make up for any fees you'll pay taking the money
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.500]   out. All right, the next step is brokerage investing. And that's where most people are going to spend the
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.100]   longest amount of time in this framework. Once your tax advantaged accounts are full,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.180]   your emergency fund solid, all your debts behind you, that your taxable brokerage accounts are going
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.240]   to be the default destination for every new dollar you save and invest. They're incredibly
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.620]   flexible. There's no contribution limits. You're not forced to pick a specific brokerage with specific
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.580]   investment options or fees. There's no penalties to withdraw it. You get long term capital gains if you
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.360]   hold your money long enough. And the right investments, there's no early withdrawal penalties,
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.960]   income phase outs, or really anything. You can use the money for anything also. You can use it for early
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.420]   retirement, travel, sabbatical, whatever you want. Although I would say if those things are in the next
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.080]   five years, it's probably not the best idea to invest them given that the market can go down. As for how to
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.200]   invest the money in your taxable brokerage account, I don't think it has to be fancy. You can build really
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.560]   serious wealth by just investing passively in low cost index funds or ETFs. I'm not trying to beat the
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.360]   market. I'm not trying to time the market. The majority of my money is in index funds just trying
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:55.340]   to match the market performance. I do personally like to be diversified across sectors and geographies.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:01.380]   So some of those are international. Some of those are US based. The majority is US based because that's
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.900]   where I live. But I do have a bit of diversification in a couple different index funds. I also like to align
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.700]   the portfolio I have and I would recommend everyone think about their own level of risk tolerance and how much
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.660]   they're willing to stomach a drop if the market changes because that's an important thing that
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.680]   if you haven't experienced it before, it can be a little bit tough to experience. And then I would
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.320]   just really avoid over trading unnecessary complexity. I don't like to spend a lot of time in my brokerage
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.840]   account thinking about it at all. In fact, most of mine is automated and it's not something I check on
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.420]   a daily basis. I actually went really deep on everything when it comes to building a portfolio
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.260]   with my old co-founder from the financial planning firm I ran. It's in episode 168. But
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.280]   beyond that, taxable brokerage accounts are really powerful for long-term investing when it comes to
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.380]   tax efficiency. So a few reasons. One, you get access to long-term capital gains rate, right? The tax rate
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.480]   you pay at the federal level on long-term investments that are held for more than a year where you have
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.820]   gains is lower than the income tax rate for a similar level of income. So you're getting preferable tax
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   treatment on long-term investments, which is fantastic. And you can take advantage of tax
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:15.600]   loss harvesting. Meaning if you have an investment that is down below the price you paid, you can sell
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.180]   that investment and capture those losses and use them to offset other gains, whether it's long or
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.920]   short-term gains, or you can offset up to $3,000 of income a year. Now, when you do that, when you sell
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.640]   that asset, you're not still holding it. So if your intent is to keep that investment, then you can rebuy that
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:39.660]   investment. However, either you need to wait 30 days to avoid what the IRS calls a wash sale, where you
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.580]   actually aren't able to capture those losses, or you can buy something very similar. So if you're
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:51.200]   holding an S&P 500 fund, you could maybe buy a U.S. total stock market fund, and that would not be the
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.640]   exact same investment. So you could sell the S&P 500 fund when it's down, buy the total stock market fund at
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:04.080]   that same level. And then as the market rises, you would have a lower cost basis, meaning someday in
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.980]   the future when you sell, you will likely owe more taxes. Though if those investments do happen to end
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:15.060]   up being donated to charity, which I'll talk to about in a second, or if those investments are passed down
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:20.160]   to your children, there might be a step up and they won't actually have taxes due. But in general, if you
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   were to sell them and use those proceeds yourself, you would have taxes owed, but they would come at that
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.680]   long-term capital gains rate. So if you're able to use those captured tax losses now to offset your
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:37.380]   tax today, especially if it's your actual short-term cap gains or income tax rates, it can be pretty
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.300]   advantageous. It's a lot to think about. And so I personally like to use an investment platform that
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.560]   does this for me. Full disclosure, I worked at Wealthfront. I'm a shareholder of Wealthfront.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.760]   I use Wealthfront. I do pay fees at Wealthfront because I'm no longer an employee. And so I use them to
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.840]   automate all my investing, tax loss harvesting, rebalancing. I think that the benefit of tax
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:03.900]   loss harvesting far outweighs the 0.25% fee I pay to have it managed. So there are other solutions.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.180]   If you're not interested, you can do tax loss harvesting yourself. It can just be a little bit
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.640]   more complicated and you want to keep track of things in a better way than if you outsource it
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.520]   to software that is doing all that for you. You can also donate appreciated assets to charity.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:24.560]   So I like to say, if you're donating any amount of money ever, any year to charity, I would encourage
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:30.500]   you to, instead of donating cash, donate any appreciated securities and ideally the most
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.820]   appreciated securities, the ones that have the highest baked in gains. Because when you donate
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:40.400]   those securities to charity, the charity gets the full amount of the donation, but you don't have to pay
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.420]   any income taxes for selling those securities or capital gains taxes or any taxes, but you get the
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.820]   full tax deduction as if you gave the total amount, which you did. And then you could take whatever
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.940]   money you were otherwise going to use to donate to charity. And then you could just rebuy that same
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.640]   investment. The watch sale rule doesn't apply here because you didn't actually sell the security,
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:05.020]   you donated it. So anytime anyone's donated to charity, I like to say, always donate your securities,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:11.520]   the most appreciated ones. However, I will make one exception, which is if you do what I do and what a lot of
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.260]   other people do is set up a donor advised fund, then you can separate these decisions and make it a little
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.080]   simpler. Because if you wanted to make $100 donation to a charity, having to coordinate transferring
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.400]   stocks to their accounts, it's too much work. But if you set up a donor advised fund, what you can do is
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.600]   you can donate all those securities to one fund that you manage. And you can get the tax deduction when
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.640]   you donate the securities or cash or crypto to that fund. And then later, could be a day later,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.580]   it could be a month, a year, a decade, you can donate that money at different amounts to any
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.220]   charity you want. And that charity will get the full contribution, but they usually get that in
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.680]   the form of a check. So they don't have to deal with managing those securities like you did when
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:59.120]   you transfer them into your donor advised fund. Now, another full disclosure, I've used Daffy long
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.020]   before they became a partner of the show, but they are a sponsor and a partner of the show. So I just want
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.240]   to give that disclosure out there. They're who I use for my donor advised fund. If you want to check
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.920]   them out all the hacks.com slash Daffy D A F F Y. And I think right now you'll still get a $25
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.100]   contribution to your fund and the charity of your choice when you sign up as a new user. So I think
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.920]   that's a great option to automate all of your charitable giving. If you want to really focus on
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.860]   optimizing for the most tax advantaged way to do it. If you want a few more strategies for tax optimized
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.900]   investing, I'll give you a couple things to go do a little bit of research on one is called direct
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:39.580]   indexing, which instead of buying, let's say the S&P 500 as an index fund, you could buy all 500 stocks
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:45.360]   in the S&P 500. Now that a lot of brokerages offer fractional shares, that makes it a little easier to
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.420]   do. But I would absolutely not try to do this yourself. I would find some brokerage firm that
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:57.260]   supports direct indexing to manage it for you. And understand that if you were to ever leave that
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.740]   brokerage firm, you know, you would be stuck with 500 individual stocks, if you were trying to match
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:08.280]   the S&P 500. The advantage of doing this is you can tax loss harvest at the security level instead of
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.900]   the fund level. So on any given day, it's not that likely that the S&P 500 is down, because typically it
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.540]   goes up over time. But any individual security, I would go out and say that almost any day, one of the
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.360]   shares of the S&P 500, one of the securities there has gone down. And so it gives you the advantage of
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.980]   more tax loss harvesting opportunities. Another thing you can look at is asset location, which
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.960]   would be to take really tax efficient investments and put them in your taxable brokerage account,
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.160]   put really tax inefficient investments in your tax advantage retirement accounts, and view your
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   portfolio across all of your different accounts. I find that this is really hard to manage and there
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.580]   aren't any automated solutions I'm aware of to do it. So I found that the juice isn't worth the squeeze.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:57.280]   So to summarize, brokerage investing gives you both growth and flexibility. You're not constrained by
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.340]   any limits or penalties. And over time, I think it's going to be the biggest part of your financial
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.540]   life. And it's something you can keep adding to constantly as your income grows. In many ways,
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.920]   your taxable brokerage account kind of becomes your future freedom fund. It quietly compounds in the
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.400]   background, you continue contributing to it, and it will give you options in the future that you might not
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.040]   even know you need right now. Next, before we get to the final step, I want to talk about education
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.680]   investing and specifically where I think 529 plans fit into this framework to save for the cost of
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:31.740]   college for your children or maybe yourself. Here's my general philosophy. You shouldn't put your child's
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:37.680]   education ahead of your own financial future. You can borrow for college, often at reasonable rates,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.160]   but you can't easily borrow for your own retirement. So that's why I put education investing
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:49.520]   after your own investing in a taxable brokerage account. Now, 529s do offer tax-free growth for
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.200]   qualified education expenses, and they can be a really great tool if you know you are going to
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.880]   save to pay for college. However, I like to think about those as secondary to saving for myself, but
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.680]   there are a few exceptions. If you are in a high-income household and you're already on track to fund your
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.000]   future and you know you're going to get there, you could absolutely make the case to move some of
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.080]   your 529 contributions up earlier in this framework. Or if you live in a state that offers really generous
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.500]   state income tax deductions or credits for 529s, which California sadly doesn't, then it could make
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:25.080]   sense to prioritize this a little earlier as well. Finally, we come to our last step, number 10, which
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.540]   is to look at your optional debt. These are things that are below 6%. Like for us, we have a 30-year
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.680]   mortgage we got in 2020. We probably won't ever make another payment here other than what's required.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.480]   But for some people, these decisions aren't necessarily about optimizing their returns and
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.660]   it's more about a psychological win. If the thought of being debt-free really gives you the peace of
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.340]   mind you need to sleep well, the flexibility you need for your life, go for it. If you'd rather invest
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.900]   that money because the returns are better, that is fine too. You've earned the right to choose based
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:00.620]   on what matters to you, not just what's optimal on paper. And I know some really smart people who have
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:06.020]   the means and are aware of the financial trade-offs and still choose to pay down their debt, pay down
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.340]   their mortgage, even if the interest rates are low because it makes them sleep better at night.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.400]   Okay, so that wraps up the core framework. Those are the 10 steps I use to decide exactly where every
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   new dollar I save goes. And before I talk about a couple advanced strategies, hopefully you can see
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.740]   how this sequence will build from stability to flexibility and finally to long-term growth.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.460]   You don't need to follow it perfectly, but I think it's really helpful to have some kind of structure
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:35.380]   to help cut through the noise and eliminate some decision fatigue, especially when you've got
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:41.440]   competing priorities like saving, investing, debt, and really big life goals. So feel free to adapt it
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.500]   to your own and turn it into whatever you need to make your life a little bit more simple. But I also
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.200]   want to talk about two different perspectives or kind of advanced strategies that might be worth
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:57.400]   considering that I did include above. So the first is an increased focus on liquidity. Now, I feel like we are
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:03.040]   always being told to max out our retirement accounts. But what if you need that money before retirement and it
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.880]   wasn't something you planned three to five years in advance like I talked about? Could be wanting to take a
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:14.580]   sabbatical, start a business, buy a home, retire early. Locking everything into their retirement accounts
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:20.740]   could backfire on you because you've got to pay penalties and fees, right? The case for prioritizing
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.700]   liquidity, meaning putting money in your taxable brokerage account before your retirement accounts
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:32.720]   would avoid those 10% penalties, ordinary income tax on those retirement contributions. Now, one argument
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   I often get is, well, you can take a loan from your 401k and that's true. While the interest payments do
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.320]   accrue to you, the money is no longer invested. And if you lose your job, a lot of time those loans
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.960]   need to get paid back pretty quickly. Taxable brokerage accounts, on the other hand, you can
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:52.040]   access any time, long-term capital gains tax rates, tax loss harvesting, step-up basis if you end up
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:58.300]   leaving that money to heirs. And so yes, you may miss out on some tax savings if you focus first on your
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:04.580]   taxable brokerage account investing, but you gain a lot of flexibility. And sometimes that's worth more
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:09.800]   than the returns or tax efficiency you get for your retirement accounts. So one way you might approach this
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.940]   is to say, I think I want a little bit more flexibility. Let's just equally invest. You could
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:21.140]   say, let's prioritize half of our savings goes to brokerage investing, half goes to tax-advantaged
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.680]   accounts in our retirement accounts. You can choose how you want to do this, but I just want to flag that
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:31.940]   there is a benefit to liquidity. For every person, it's really hard to quantify. And so sometimes you
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.900]   might think, oh, it's easier to just put it all in my pre-tax account. That's more efficient in the long run.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.600]   But if you ever do need access to the money, and I would say the most recurring theme I hear from
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.240]   people that think about money and have been around for a while is you never know you need the money
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.520]   until you need the money. And so making sure you have enough money to cover whatever goals you have
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.920]   in the next three to five years, that short-term savings fund, that's important, but sometimes it's
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.340]   unexpected. And so prioritizing a little bit more brokerage investing if you have the ability before
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.780]   your retirement accounts can totally make sense if you want a little bit more liquidity.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:08.740]   This episode is brought to you by Copilot. If you're looking to get your finances organized this year,

[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:30.500]   and get hydrated. Another contrarian take I often have here is that if you have a strong credit score
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.280]   or a large investment portfolio, you might be able to reduce the amount of cash savings you have.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.520]   And that could be cash savings for a safety net or that could be cash savings for short-term goals.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.600]   And this is especially true during low interest rate environments where putting money in cash doesn't
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.500]   earn the four or more percent it does right now. I remember a handful of years ago when your savings
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:58.640]   account was earning one percent or less, it felt really painful for me to keep money in cash knowing
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:04.260]   it was earning so little. Also knowing that because interest rates were little, borrowing money was
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.580]   actually a lot more accessible in terms of the interest rate you would pay to do it. So here are
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:15.300]   a few strategies to potentially pair with keeping less cash for your safety net or your short-term goals.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.660]   So one is zero percent APR credit cards. Some credit cards offer 12 to 18 months of no interest
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.900]   on purchases, sometimes on balance transfers. Usually you're going to make a minimum payment,
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.440]   but you're not going to have to make the full payment. And so this could be a great backup
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:36.200]   emergency buffer for circumstances where you all of a sudden need some cash and you don't want to have
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.380]   to sell your investment accounts. You could take advantage of zero percent APR credit cards. Now,
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.420]   there's no guarantee that they will be around when you need them. There's no guarantee you will get
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.020]   approved for them. And so obviously these strategies are advanced because they come with some risk,
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:54.360]   but it is something that I know people have been able to take advantage of in those circumstances
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.720]   where they wanted to avoid selling from their taxable brokerage account. The next one could
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.540]   be a home equity line of credit or a HELOC. And so for homeowners, if you have equity in your home
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:09.220]   beyond your down payment amount, usually, you can access that equity by borrowing against your home
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:15.040]   with a HELOC. Now, typically the rates here are lower than a lot of personal loans or credit cards.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.740]   So that can make it advantageous. Also in a low interest rate environment, the HELOC rates are also low.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:26.300]   So if you have home equity and you need access to funds, you can effectively borrow from the bank
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:32.860]   with your home as collateral. And that allows you to have access to low cost borrowing that in certain
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.340]   interest rate environments might be really compelling as an alternative to keeping money in cash.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.040]   So you could take that money that you would have kept in cash and put it in the stock market.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.100]   Similarly, you could do what's called a PLOC, which is a portfolio line of credit, or I think
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.460]   there's some other version of it that's a security line of credit or a security backed loan.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.660]   And that lets you borrow against your taxable investments without having to sell them.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.860]   So obviously the pros here are, you can access your taxable investments without triggering capital gains.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.820]   Depending on the platform, you can get them in as little as a day, maybe even same day sometimes.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.260]   And they're pretty flexible on how long you need to repay them.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.820]   But they do come with some risks and cons.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.040]   So one, the rates on those loans are typically variable.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.980]   And so in a low interest rate environment, they can be really compelling.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.680]   So much so that you might think, well, this makes a lot more sense than keeping money in cash,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.340]   earning nothing.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.960]   But the biggest challenge here is that if your portfolio drops in value,
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.920]   you may face what's called a margin call.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.940]   Now, I'm not going to do a deep dive here on the nuance of how this would happen and what happens.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.980]   But the high level here is your brokerage firm is going to be able to loan you money
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.640]   as a percentage of your balance of the eligible securities.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:47.200]   So let's say you had $100,000, they might be willing to loan you half of that.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.120]   So $50,000.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:53.000]   But if your portfolio drops from $100,000 because the market crashes to $80,000,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.140]   they might only be willing to loan you $40,000.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.860]   And you might need to make a margin call or a deposit to close that gap.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.740]   So this is not for people who are really risk averse.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.300]   Unless you do what I've done in the past, which is just keep that amount small.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:18.460]   So the amount that might trigger a margin call might be 60% or 70% of the loan to the portfolio value.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.040]   So if you were to borrow only 10% of your portfolio,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:28.780]   the risk that your portfolio drops so much that 10% you borrowed now becomes 70%
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:34.220]   is really a catastrophic situation where the market's crashed by more than 50%.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.880]   And so some programs, I know at Wealthfront,
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.200]   we did this where you couldn't borrow more than 30% of your portfolio.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.080]   And the primary reason is that we really didn't want to let people get into a situation
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.040]   where they were having to make these margin calls.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.480]   So if you manage this appropriately and you borrow a smaller percentage of your portfolio
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:57.160]   such that even a 50% crash in the market is not going to require you to make immediate payments.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.400]   Because by the way, in that 50% crash scenario is probably the last time
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.240]   you want to be able to make payments because maybe you lost your job.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.000]   Maybe there's all kinds of stuff happening.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.380]   And so if you can manage it appropriately,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.500]   I think it could be a really interesting alternative to keeping money in cash.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:18.700]   So let's say you decide your safety net should be $100,000 and you have a million dollars in your taxable brokerage account.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.900]   Well, in the worst case that you need to borrow that $100,000,
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.940]   you're going to be able to borrow it and it's only going to be 10% of your portfolio.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.860]   So I feel like that is a very low risk circumstance.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.520]   Whereas if you only had $100,000 in your taxable brokerage account and you needed to borrow $80,000 or $100,000 for a safety net,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.860]   it would not be a scenario I'd want to rely on.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.660]   And this might also vary depending on the interest rates.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.080]   Right now with high interest rates, both to borrow and to earn on cash,
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.260]   you might just be willing to keep your money in cash to make things simpler.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.700]   But if things change, it might make sense to invest that money and rely on being able to borrow from your portfolio.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:40:00.240]   So that setup would let you keep your money working in the markets, but give you access to liquidity when you need it.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.160]   But obviously it comes with some risks.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.180]   So please go do some research before you take advantage of it.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:11.060]   So that's the full picture from the foundational steps to some more advanced moves that I've been thinking about and using for years.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:16.260]   So whether you're just starting out or you're fine tuning a little bit more of a complex financial life,
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.460]   I really hope this helps you feel more confident about what you do with your money.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.020]   And now that we've gone through it, I want to switch gears and answer a few questions I got from listeners
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.920]   because hearing how this applies in real life is where sometimes it really starts to click.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.420]   So first question is from Matthew, just moved to a new state for a new job and is selling his house
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.560]   and is going to bank a few hundred thousand dollars.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.740]   And they decided they're going to rent for a year while they figure out the market
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.640]   and wants to know what to do with that money that's come in.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.540]   And he said, do I pay off debt?
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.880]   I've got some student loans.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.760]   I have a car loan at 5.24%.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.620]   Do I put it in high yield savings?
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.560]   Right now, he said he has emergency funds of about $10,000 for three kids
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.340]   and wants to know what he should start doing.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.640]   And so first off, congrats on the new job.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.720]   You're in a great position.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.080]   You're debt conscious.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.400]   And you've got this windfall coming, which is awesome.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.080]   As for what to do with this windfall, obviously, you could just follow the steps I mentioned.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.420]   But I'm going to walk through my thoughts.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.740]   So you said you've got about a $10,000 emergency fund right now.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:19.100]   With three kids and a new job, I personally would want a bit more of a safety net.
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.180]   I don't know how much you spend each month.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.040]   But I'm guessing $10,000 isn't going to cover three to six months of monthly expenses.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.140]   So that would be the first place I prioritize with the money from selling your house.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.920]   Obviously, before that, I would prioritize setting aside any money you're going to owe for taxes.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.440]   But assuming that you lived in the house for long enough,
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:43.220]   that first $250,000 if you're not married, $500,000 if you're married,
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.300]   should be tax-free on gains from a primary resident.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.000]   So hopefully, you don't have any taxes to set aside money for.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.380]   But anytime anyone is thinking about a windfall,
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.980]   I would make sure that if you're going to owe taxes on that windfall, you set that aside first.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.080]   Next, I'd go through that debt review process.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.560]   You mentioned you have $50,000 of student loans.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.960]   But you said right now, 40,000 of them are on hold without any interest owed.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.080]   And so I don't know the percent on that other $10,000.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.200]   And you mentioned a car loan at 5.24%.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.600]   So the loans you don't owe interest on, I wouldn't pay them off.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.460]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.920]   The car loan at 5.24%, that's pretty close to the break-even point, right?
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.240]   It's going to probably not be as much as you earn on cash.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.940]   But it'd be pretty hard to borrow at 5.24% right now.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.360]   You're probably going to do better in the market in the long run based on historical averages.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.280]   So if it feels like a mental burden, you could pay it off.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.720]   I probably wouldn't personally pay it off right now.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.120]   After debt, I'd be thinking about your short-term goals.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.920]   And you mentioned you're going to rent for a year.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.600]   If you're thinking of buying a home after that,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.800]   I'd want to set aside money in cash, something safe and liquid for that down payment.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.320]   And if that down payment is going to take the full amount of money you're having,
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.080]   then that's what I would do.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.860]   That's where I would stop.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.300]   But if that amount of money you're getting from your home sale is actually way more than
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.580]   you'd need for a down payment than any excess,
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.220]   I would probably put in either a tax-advantaged or taxable brokerage account,
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.860]   depending on how you want to think about liquidity
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.320]   and what types of retirement accounts you have access to.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.980]   And as I'm saying that, I realized I didn't mention the employer match.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.500]   Obviously, if your employer has a match, I would do that first.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.100]   I would max that out and then come back to everything I just said.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.000]   And if you aren't thinking of a down payment,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.620]   because you're not thinking of buying a home and you decide you want to rent forever
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.680]   and you have no short-term goals, then great.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   I would invest all the money once you've maxed out your safety net.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.980]   And so that's what I would be thinking about.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.360]   So hopefully that's helpful.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.120]   You don't have to make every decision now.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.440]   You can let the money sit and think about it,
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.360]   but let it sit somewhere where it's earning interest
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.500]   and try not to let it look at you and convince you to spend it
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.940]   and turn into lifestyle inflation.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.720]   I'd encourage you to be intentional with every dollar
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.880]   and you'll keep winning like it seems like you have.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.120]   Next is a question from Chris.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.900]   He says he's currently using SoFi as a brokerage account
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.060]   and they offer 1% back with all of his investment contributions.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.940]   And then he's converting that 1% into cash and reinvesting it.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.700]   And he mentioned that I've talked about tax loss harvesting.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.780]   I've talked about Wealthfront.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.860]   Curious if that's better than the 1% cash back
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.220]   he's getting on all his investments.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.980]   And also curious if he should be donating securities
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.000]   with the highest capital gains to a donor-advised fund like Daffy
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.360]   to try and further optimize.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.320]   And so first off, I love that you're already thinking about automation.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:14.940]   This is great.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.520]   Now, if you compare these, SoFi right now,
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.700]   according to what he said,
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.040]   is giving him a 1% guaranteed return on every contribution.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:22.820]   It's clean.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:23.400]   It's simple.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.300]   It's pretty rare.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.620]   And then Wealthfront's got tax loss harvesting,
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.180]   which research often shows over time can add half to 1% in after-tax return.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.760]   So if you're just comparing apples to apples right there,
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.800]   I'd take the 1% on every contribution every day.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.860]   Now, I don't know how long you have to leave that money in there,
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.580]   but if you had, let's say, $50,000 saved
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.320]   and you're only adding $100 a month,
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.660]   you're only getting that 1% on the contribution
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.540]   versus on the tax loss harvesting side,
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.180]   whatever amount you prescribe,
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.100]   whether that's half a percent or 1%,
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.080]   is going to apply to the whole portfolio value.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.640]   That said, over time, as the market increases in value,
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.340]   the real opportunities for tax loss harvesting
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   are going to be the new contributions that have lower cost bases.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:13.320]   So in theory, I think the tax loss harvesting could outperform SoFi.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.300]   But right now, if the bulk of your investments
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.200]   are coming from regular contributions
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.820]   and you're not sitting on a really large pool of investments,
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:21.780]   I would keep doing that.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.340]   If SoFi gets rid of that,
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.840]   then I could make an argument that tax loss harvesting
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.240]   could outperform not tax loss harvesting,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.080]   but you could also do that on your own in your brokerage account.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.400]   You don't have to automate it
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.140]   and you don't have to necessarily do it on a daily basis
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.220]   or even weekly basis.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.140]   I think that in the last few years,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.360]   90% of the benefit of tax loss harvesting for me
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.960]   happened right after the pandemic.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.780]   But you do have to have the ability
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.840]   and the mental capacity to act when things are down,
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:51.920]   which can be super stressful,
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.540]   which is why I like to automate it.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.120]   On to the question about appreciated assets.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:55.780]   Absolutely.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.060]   If you're donating to charity,
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.620]   donate appreciated assets.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.960]   If you don't want to donate the appreciated assets
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.840]   directly to charity,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.420]   donate it to a donor advised fund.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.920]   The only exception I'll say here is
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.120]   in his question, Chris mentioned,
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.700]   should I move to Wealthfront and do that?
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.400]   And I will say no,
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.540]   because Wealthfront,
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.440]   at least as of the last time I asked,
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.320]   does not let you partially transfer out securities.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.200]   You have to transfer the entire account.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.300]   So if you had an account with $100,000 of securities
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.840]   and you wanted to donate $1,000 to a charity
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   in the form of one of those securities,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.680]   you would actually have to transfer
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.300]   all your brokerage account to another brokerage account,
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.260]   transfer the securities that you want to a charity
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.420]   or to your donor advised fund,
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.100]   and then move all of those securities back to Wealthfront.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.180]   So I would say if your goal is to regularly donate appreciated assets
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.120]   from your brokerage account,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.800]   Wealthfront is not a great option.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.940]   However, if you're managing individual stock positions,
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.560]   maybe at one brokerage account,
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   and you're managing your diversified,
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.140]   low-cost index funds at Wealthfront,
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.660]   then you could use that other brokerage account
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.780]   as the place you make a lot of your contributions
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.820]   to your donor advised fund.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.640]   That's what I do.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.220]   My brokerage account for my individual stocks is separate.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.060]   And then my brokerage account at Wealthfront
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.180]   is long-term investing where I'm not making contributions
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.380]   from that account to my donor advised fund.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.920]   This episode is brought to you by Masterclass.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.540]   I have learned so much about everything from communication
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.220]   to leadership to negotiation from business experts on this show.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.040]   But if you're like me, you are always hungry for more.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.900]   And that's when I turned to Masterclass.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.260]   It's the only streaming platform where you can learn and grow
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.440]   with over 200 of the world's best.

[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.520]   I've leveled up my investing with Ray Dalio,
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.700]   perfected pizza making with Tony Gimignani,
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.020]   and picked up so many great business lessons
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.320]   from Howard Schultz, Rosalind Brewer, Bob Iger,
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.180]   and so many more, all through Masterclass.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.400]   But recently, I wanted to set up some great habits for 2025,
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.000]   and I took James Clear's class on habits,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.120]   and it was so helpful.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.860]   And it's not just me that loves it.

[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.320]   All right, two more.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.400]   Next one's a great question.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.060]   I'm 38.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.760]   I have a wife and a couple young kids, seven and four.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.820]   And my portfolio has been long time managed by my father's friend,
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.720]   who's a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.560]   And a few years back, we learned we're paying 1.25% in fees,
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.780]   which we negotiated down to 0.75.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.320]   But when I'm looking at the returns and the investment options,
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.280]   my net returns are not great.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.620]   However, I'm in a lot of individual stocks.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.620]   And I know that if I transition to the portfolio I want,
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.380]   I'm going to be paying a lot of taxes
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.340]   because I'm going to have to sell all those stocks and buy index funds.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.040]   This is a loaded question and I really appreciate you sending it in.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.840]   It's a lot more common than you think that people have just inherited
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.080]   their parents' financial advisor and haven't really thought about it for too long.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.480]   So high fee management can really eat away at your portfolio.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.660]   A 0.75% fee over 15 years is a really big deal,
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.880]   especially if the funds that you're being invested in
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.860]   are also high fee themselves or not exactly what you want.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.100]   In this person's case, they said they're an individual stock.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.920]   So there's probably not a lot of fees there.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.000]   But another thing I often see is that you've got high management fees
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   plus proprietary funds with their own high fees.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.040]   And that can really eat at the value of the portfolio.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.180]   So the good news is you don't have to sell everything all at once.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.460]   So if this were me,
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.200]   I would pretty quickly move all of those investments
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.420]   into a brokerage account that is self-directed
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:45.980]   and not managed by a financial advisor.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.060]   And that'll eliminate the 0.75% fee.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.160]   And then I would over time
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.460]   start to transition out this portfolio.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.920]   You could start to look at it.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.560]   Some of the things you're invested in
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.300]   might not have a lot of baked in capital gains.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.060]   Those will be easier to sell now.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.200]   Each year, you can kind of sell up to the top
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.800]   of your current capital gains bracket is one option.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.300]   You kind of decide at what level you're willing to
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.140]   realize those gains today
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.060]   to be able to get into a portfolio you really want.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.440]   I don't envy this situation.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.260]   I was actually in a similar situation for a different reason.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.340]   And so one of the great things about tax loss harvesting
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.640]   was that during the pandemic a few years ago,
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.700]   we harvested a lot of tax losses.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.700]   And then I used those to be able to get out of this situation.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.320]   Obviously, I'm not hoping that the market crashes
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.080]   so you can capture a lot of losses.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.840]   But in a circumstance where the market did crash
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.040]   and you could capture losses,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.220]   this is a great opportunity to use them
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.420]   and remove the psychological barrier
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.660]   of trying to sell your positions you're not happy about
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.060]   knowing you're going to have to realize capital gains.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.480]   Now, another couple of things to keep in mind.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.900]   One, if you have dividend reinvesting on,
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.380]   immediately you can turn that off
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.600]   so you're not rebuying these positions.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.420]   Sometimes that's part of your portfolio
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.360]   and the way it's set up.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.060]   One other thing,
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.360]   depending on what kinds of stocks you have,
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.340]   you might be able to incorporate them into a portfolio.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.080]   So I actually had a handful of individual stocks,
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.480]   mostly Apple and Facebook and Google.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.160]   And I wanted to start doing more index fund investing.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.620]   And so I set up direct indexing at Wealthfront.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.420]   And I actually transferred in those stocks
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.420]   and Wealthfront incorporated them
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.060]   into the direct indexing portfolio.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.000]   So if you look at the S&P 500
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.260]   or you look at the total US stock market,
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:34.020]   no individual stock is more than 6% or 7%.
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.620]   And that's the high end, right?
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.180]   That's the Microsofts, the NVIDIAs.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.440]   But let's say you had $100,000
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.680]   and in that $100,000,
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.820]   5,000 was Google or Facebook or Apple
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.060]   or Microsoft or NVIDIA.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.800]   And you wanted to do a direct indexing strategy
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.040]   with someone like Wealthfront
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.480]   or someone else that offers that.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.100]   You might be able to transfer those positions in
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.920]   and have the strategy built around it.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.560]   I know there's a company called Freck
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.380]   that does direct indexing.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.600]   I got to know the founder.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.000]   I think it's a really cool product.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.160]   They might actually be able to incorporate these as well.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.680]   And so taking a look at incorporating
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.180]   your existing positions into something
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.240]   you don't have to manage at a much lower fee
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.680]   could make a lot of sense.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.160]   Now, obviously, I don't know your portfolio.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.720]   I don't know what those stocks are.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.580]   I don't know what the Morgan Stanley advisor picked.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.860]   So I can't really speak to that in much detail.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.620]   As we mentioned before on charitable giving,
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.220]   if you're regularly donating money to charity,
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.200]   then I think you could use your appreciated stocks
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.100]   to donate to charity,
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.660]   take the money you otherwise would have donated to charity
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.440]   and buy the investments you actually want.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.760]   And so that's another great strategy.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.140]   So I know that's a lot.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.380]   You don't have to do it all at once.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.920]   Come up with a plan and a transition timeline
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.300]   and slowly chip away at it over time.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.060]   I think you'll get there soon enough
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.880]   and it'll feel really good to not be paying
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.180]   those advisory fees.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.340]   So last question was a quick one,
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.260]   which was, what are your thoughts on financial advisors?
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.200]   Great question.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:52.780]   Let me be clear.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.400]   I don't think financial advisors are bad.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.940]   I was one in a previous life.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.760]   I ran a firm for them in a previous life.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.620]   I do think the industry needs to evolve.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.360]   Many advisors are charging a high percentage
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.320]   of your portfolio just to manage a few investments
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.300]   that software can do a great job of.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.340]   So I'm not a fan of paying 1%, half a percent,
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:13.100]   0.75% for someone to manage my portfolio.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.120]   I'd much rather do that on an automated basis with software.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:20.040]   However, if your financial advisor is doing financial planning,
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.160]   tax planning, estate strategy,
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.160]   helping you with complicated decisions in your family
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.860]   or with the equity you have in a company you work at,
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:31.440]   those are great reasons to be getting help
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.520]   for your financial life.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.980]   And those are things that you should pay a professional for.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.700]   Personally, I prefer to pay a flat fee
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:42.240]   on an hourly, monthly, annual basis for advice
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.180]   and then pay for my investments
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.000]   either as part of that fee
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.200]   or as a percentage that is much, much lower.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.660]   And there are a lot of financial planners out there
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.700]   you can take a look at
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.720]   that are fiduciary only, fee-based
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.020]   and not focused on a percentage of assets.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.680]   So that is something I would like to do.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.100]   So I think advisors still matter.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.280]   I still think they're helpful,
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.600]   but I want to make sure you're getting real value
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.320]   relative to how much you're paying for them.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.340]   So I really hope it was helpful
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.380]   for you guys to hear those four questions
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.720]   and how I think about them
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.880]   and walk through my entire money allocation framework.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.640]   The goal was for this to be a helpful way
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.900]   for you guys to think about money
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.020]   and how to allocate money
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.820]   and hear my perspective on how I think about it
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.120]   as someone who's probably spent decades
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.720]   thinking about this exact topic
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.160]   and helping other clients do it.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.220]   If you have other questions similar to this
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.120]   or on any topic,
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.600]   I always love to hear them
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.700]   and I'm trying to find ways
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.560]   to incorporate them in future episodes.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.680]   And in many ways,
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.040]   the questions you guys have
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.440]   that aren't necessarily answered
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.480]   in any episode you've heard so far
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.100]   are great ways that I think about future content.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.440]   So please send them over
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.080]   podcast at allthehacks.com.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.900]   I definitely read everything that comes in.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.300]   That is it for this week.
