[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.040]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.160]   Today I want to continue talking about some of the fallout from the Russian invasion of
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.400]   Ukraine and specifically I want to talk about some things that could happen, potentialities,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.000]   in the coming days and weeks.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.960]   If you will think about some of these things, you may succeed in making good plans to prepare
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.680]   for them if they did happen to protect yourself and your family from anything that could potentially
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   happen.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.920]   For context, the day is Thursday, February 24, 2022 and in the last 18 hours Russia has
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.200]   invaded Ukraine and the extent of the invasion is quite significant.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.920]   Situation on the ground is very serious.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.180]   You have Russian troops coming in by all methods.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.040]   You have Ukrainian government has declared a massive national emergency.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.520]   But more than that, they have gone to a system of martial law.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.160]   They are on an absolute wartime footing at this point in time.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.520]   Even to the point where they are opening up military armories and passing out weapons.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.920]   Reportedly, they passed out 10,000 weapons in the central city of Kiev, the capital city
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   of Kiev.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.200]   10,000 weapons to basically any person who will come and wield those weapons.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.120]   I've been trying to confirm this.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.800]   I think it seems the case.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   But at this point in time, any men of military age are not allowed to leave Ukraine.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.800]   The Ukrainian parliament has imposed a national state of emergency and they have announced
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.440]   compulsory military service for all men of fighting age.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.480]   This is even to the point where I have obtained reports, again I'm not a verified journalist,
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.840]   this is just Joshua's web snooping and looking around, but even reports that the surrounding
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   nations such as Poland, they are not letting fleeing males enter the nation of Poland.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.640]   On the Polish border, they have been accepting Ukrainian refugees, people fleeing Ukraine,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   but now they're not even letting Ukrainian men enter the border out of respect for the
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.680]   government's forced, the Ukrainian government's forced conscription.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.940]   So it's an incredibly serious time.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.160]   You have a dictator with tremendous force who has made decisions to take things to a
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.320]   very, very high level.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.440]   And of course, as always, it's a real mixture.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   One of the amazing things about the modern era is you can watch online, if you're a decent
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.400]   OSINT enthusiast or if you're a decent web snooper, you can find lots of on the ground
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   reporting and you can see that there are many areas of intense problems, but on the whole,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.760]   it's kind of peaceful in terms of many streets.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.880]   Not like it looks like everyone is facing trials all at once, it's just in isolated
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.240]   areas as the invaders spread across the country.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   But certainly the scenes are quite shocking.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.040]   I think one of the most shocking things and sobering, you see the Ukrainian people taking
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.220]   shelter in their underground stations, stretching out and sleeping in the underground stations
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.040]   for fear of aerial bombardment.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   And of course, it harkens back to the images that we know so well from the people sleeping
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.240]   in the London underground during the aerial bombardments in World War II, etc.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.600]   And so a very serious situation.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.920]   If you're on the ground in Ukraine, my thoughts are with you and I pray that you'd be protected
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.560]   and no great courage as you confront those who are invading your land.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   If you're on the ground in Russia, there's a whole different set of situations that you
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   are facing.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   There are thousands of Russians protesting the war in public squares and as is always
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.160]   the case in a tyrannical society.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.400]   Like Russia, you have the police sitting there shuffling them off, arresting hundreds and
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.200]   hundreds of protesters for voicing their opinion in the streets of Russia.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.600]   And so it's a serious situation all over.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:05:00.080]   And today President Biden in the United States announced wide-ranging sanctions, freezing
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.760]   the assets of Russian banks held in the United States, freezing the assets of various powerful
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.400]   and notable Russian citizens, widespread sanctions on the nation of Russia.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.320]   Now the question is, what happens from here?
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.360]   And of course, we don't know, we're all guessing.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.640]   There's a major difference today from 48 hours ago.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.760]   48 hours ago, the US administration, US intelligence agencies were warning of an almost certain
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.720]   invasion of Russia and there were many who were quite skeptical of that.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.600]   Well now everything is different.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.400]   And so the question is, what happens from here?
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.240]   Where do you go from here?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.320]   The international outcry against President Putin and his actions has been significant
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.960]   and so we can expect quite significant response.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.560]   But it would seem foolish to me to think that President Putin has not anticipated the response.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.520]   The response that has happened so far is about what you would predict.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.760]   You know, economic sanctions are the favorite and most commonly used tool of international
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.560]   sanctionary, international, I can't say diplomacy, but international actions.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.640]   When you have large and powerful countries who don't wish to commit their soldiers and
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.680]   armed forces to actual war and don't want to engage in even necessarily virtual war,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.600]   whether it's lobbying missiles or doing aerial bombardments or engaging in cyber warfare,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.080]   you don't want to, then they use sanctions.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.400]   But sanctions certainly seem to have quite limited effects and it would seem to me that
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:47.000]   President Putin has spent the last years working very diligently to build up the economic self-sufficiency
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.760]   of his nation, pay down national debt, improve the situation so that they would not be as
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.000]   affected by sanctions, and also sought to form alliances, I think, perhaps most interestingly
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.360]   or worriedly, most notably, perhaps with the nation of China.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.040]   At this point in time, I have a couple of serious concerns of things that could happen,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.760]   notwithstanding the serious situation that the Ukrainian and Russian people are in.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.120]   Those of us who are physically more distant, I think we also have our own concerns.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.720]   First, there's going to be a significant disruption in markets, and I think the most
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.960]   important disruptions will come in the energy markets.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.200]   I think you can expect and should expect a significant rise in energy prices.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.640]   Now, I'm not competent to elucidate exactly the play-by-play moves that are likely to
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   come.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.600]   One of the interesting pieces of bargaining power that President Putin has is the control
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.200]   over gas supplies to much of Europe.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:01.080]   While there is some maneuvering at the edges, much of Europe is exceedingly dependent upon
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.120]   Russian gas supplies.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:11.920]   If you are in Europe, you should be significantly concerned about that and how that may impact
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   your life.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.200]   To the extent, you should consider, of course, electricity prices, fuel prices, etc.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.640]   Heating prices may be significantly affected, and that should factor into your thoughts
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.520]   in terms of your personal finances and/or your investment decisions.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.680]   The energy situation in the United States is very concerning because over the last couple
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.760]   of years, major domestic supplies of energy have been shuttered and turned off.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.920]   You had the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline project that would have brought a tremendous
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.240]   amount of energy into the United States from our stable northern neighbor.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.560]   But what is concerning to me is not just the standard market disruptions, but the potential
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:03.840]   for things to escalate to the scale of cyber warfare.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.380]   I want to be cautious and not overstate things, but I think the most important and compelling
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:20.120]   story of the last year was the Colonial Pipeline hack in the United States that resulted in
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:27.960]   widespread fuel shortages, major disruptions in many places in the United States, and again
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:34.640]   widespread fuel shortages to the point where many gas stations are simply not prepared.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:42.400]   I think the biggest weakness that you have in many of our nations is our dependence on
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:52.820]   electricity, but more properly, you have our dependence upon modern information technology.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.500]   It would seem to me that we're pretty well behind the curve in terms of protecting these
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.100]   technologies from external attack.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.540]   Originally, when the technology was invented, it was invented for utilitarian purposes.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:17.660]   It was not invented and planned that it would somehow be a secure utility protected from
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.660]   modern threats.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.860]   Let me give a metaphor example and some practical examples.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.500]   If you think about something like email, people are often concerned about the security of
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.180]   email, rightly so.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.180]   You have conversations about things like encryption.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.820]   How do you encrypt your emails for privacy?
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.380]   How do you hold your emails encrypted?
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.860]   How do you make email secure?
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.460]   There are certain ways to improve the security of email, but at its core, the fundamental
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:51.500]   flaw in a security analysis of email is that email was never designed to be secure.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:58.260]   By its very nature, the way that the system uses header information to process messages
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:04.700]   and send them from the sender to the recipient, it was designed to be an open and semi-public
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.540]   form of communication.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.420]   You can come along and you can encrypt certain things.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:16.940]   You can make certain tweaks to improve the security of email, but at its core, email
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.820]   is fundamentally unsecure because it was never designed with security in mind.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:29.220]   This is why if you are concerned about security and you move from email to something like
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:35.540]   a modern secure messaging app, you automatically have a significant upgrade in security because
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.100]   these new messaging applications were designed with security in mind.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.740]   They're substantially more secure.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.820]   They protect the metadata.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:49.540]   They have more protection around concealing the identities of the people communicating
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.580]   in addition to actually securing the message itself.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.100]   Now let's go to the world that we live in.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:05.580]   Something like the electrical grids upon which we are so dependent for our modern lifestyle.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:13.620]   The electrical grids were originally an analog system and then they became a digitally operated
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.340]   and intelligently operated grid system.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.340]   But these grids were not originally designed to be secure.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.380]   You didn't have the US military coming in and building a grid to be protected.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.340]   Rather what you had was computer scientists saying, "Let's make this more efficient."
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.540]   But there were lots and lots of vulnerabilities in the electrical grid.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.300]   One of the things that's so shocking is when you start to look into attacks upon drug or
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.340]   cell electrical grids, there's abundant evidence of many people who have attacked things like
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.340]   an electrical grid.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.540]   Similar with other aspects of data, information security, etc.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:58.540]   And again you saw in the colonial pipeline situation, the debacle from this past year,
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:09.060]   that it's quite possible for smooth, sophisticated people on the other side of the world to manipulate
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:16.220]   something as basic and mechanical as a pipeline to very disastrous effect.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:24.900]   When you think about other recent stories, this last couple of weeks in the Canadian
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:31.820]   Freedom Convoy protests, you had, remember what you had with the financial situation.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.940]   So originally the Canadian truckers had a GoFundMe account set up.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.260]   Then the Canadian government sued GoFundMe and said, "We're going to block the funds."
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.460]   GoFundMe said, "All right, well, we're going to give some of the money back and then the
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.260]   money doesn't go back.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.060]   We're going to return our people's donations if they claim them.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.620]   And then the money that's not claimed, we're going to send it on to some not-for-profit
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.620]   entities."
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   And everybody made a ruckus.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.220]   A few hours later, they said, "We're going to send the information back."
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:06.180]   But the important point, sorry, send the money back and then they refunded everybody's donations.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.020]   The important thing here though is what happened next.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:18.060]   Next, the site GiveSendGo, which bills itself as an alternative Christian-oriented collection
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.500]   site for fundraisers said, "Well, we'll step up and we'll protect the truckers."
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.200]   And so they started raising money for the truckers saying, "We're not going to buckle
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.260]   our knees like GoFundMe did in face of government control."
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:43.660]   Well, some, I don't know who, but some hackers took on GiveSendGo and they succeeded in a
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.660]   couple of things.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:52.180]   Number one, they scraped all of the data from those who contributed to the GiveSendGo campaign
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:58.060]   and they started publishing that hacked, scraped data online.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:04.580]   The second thing they did was they took the website down and they replaced it with their
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.580]   own messages, rather crude messages saying, "Why are you doing this?"
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:15.620]   And so they showed their power over the GiveSendGo website.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:23.840]   That data that they scraped and then published was then used and is being used as a major
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:33.360]   point of division and controversy within primarily Canadian communities and then also other communities
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.100]   around the world as well.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.680]   Journalists started going through that data and they started studying who is involved
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.920]   in that data.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.520]   Who is, what are the names that are there?
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.900]   What are the domain names of the email addresses?
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.800]   There are various staffers filed because they made their contribution to GiveSendGo using
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.720]   their corporate email address.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.840]   Companies are being asked.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.080]   Journalists are emailing people saying, "Hey, there's somebody with your name and your email
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:08.800]   address made a $40 donation to the Freedom Convoy campaign in Canada, which is now of
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.280]   course billed as an insurrection in the Canadian system.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.800]   And so people trying to throw over the government, what do you have to say for yourself?"
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.560]   And then what has also happened is that information has been used and spread still farther.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.200]   So there have been reports of people taking those names and addresses of the people making
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.000]   the donations and they're printing them out on basically shame lists, printing them on
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.640]   a paper and putting them on the front doors of their building saying, "You should know
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.640]   your neighbours.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.780]   Here are the 15 people in our building that contributed to the occupation of Ottawa 2022.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.520]   And here are their names, here are their contribution amounts, et cetera.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.840]   Know your neighbours."
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:58.680]   And so this information is being used to sow significant levels of distrust and disharmony
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:06.520]   in what was formerly a country where you had a pretty peaceful, harmonious relationship
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.080]   among its citizens.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.680]   Those are a couple of stories of relatively isolated events.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:26.640]   Now, when you think about somebody or a military empire with far more resources than those
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.560]   particular events, you're not dealing with something small.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.840]   Those events are small with regard to the widespread destruction that can be raised
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.360]   through hacking, through cyber warfare.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:49.240]   And the Russian cyber warfare capabilities are extraordinarily extensive.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.960]   They're being used to some extent right now as the Russian armies invade Ukraine.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:03.320]   They'll be used by the dictator of Russia himself as he suppresses dissent, as he works
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.520]   in his own society, he will use his cyber warfare capabilities.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:15.400]   The question is, will those cyber warfare capabilities be used beyond the borders of
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.560]   Russia and Ukraine?
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:23.480]   I don't know, but I consider it a significant threat, very much worth thinking about.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.480]   What would that look like?
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.480]   I don't know.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:34.500]   It could be quite significant in terms of disruption of electricity grids, disruption
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:41.040]   of pipelines, those things could be seriously costly and seriously disruptive.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.360]   They could be more of what Russia has been doing significant amounts of, of just simply
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:55.280]   misinformation campaigns, sowing discord and distrust among societies, including the American
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.840]   society.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.400]   That's a very, very significant and powerful thing.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   You see that right now.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:08.440]   You see that, that right now the political administration in the United States enjoys
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:17.040]   extraordinarily low levels of consensus and support because of the widespread distrust
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.000]   among the American population.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.880]   The significant levels of acrimony, of infighting, of arguing, etc. has been enhanced by many
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.400]   misinformation campaigns.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:40.080]   It's hard for me to assess the percentage of the blame, how much goes to real legitimate
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.720]   conversations over and disagreements over the issues at hand, how much is to blame for
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:55.080]   people for the fundamental nature of the downsides of communicating with one another on Twitter,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.280]   how much is due to the Russian misinformation farms, I don't know.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.840]   But I do know it's a significant problem and it makes, it makes it very, very difficult
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:15.600]   for a nation to give some kind of unified effective response.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.640]   I think this is a far bigger risk than many people are thinking of or considering.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:31.040]   Again I don't see how President Putin would gain by antagonizing a country like the United
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.160]   States.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.600]   It would seem to me, not knowing all of his evil machinations, it would seem to me that
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:44.960]   he has his ambitions, he has tested and proven a number of times with the annexation of Crimea,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.720]   the invasions in Georgia, he has tested and proven that he can take certain levels of
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:56.280]   military action and get away with it and be left alone by the rest of the world.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.960]   And right now it would seem pretty obvious that no one is particularly interested in
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.560]   signing up to go and fight alongside the Ukrainians.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.120]   The Ukrainians are pretty much on their own.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:14.920]   Certainly Western countries are willing to send some levels of materiel support, I'm
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:22.840]   sure intelligence support, information sharing, etc. but there's no appetite for outright
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.000]   side-by-side fighting with the Ukrainians from at least any government that I can see.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.400]   And so it's going to be pretty much down to the Russians and the Ukrainians themselves
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.720]   to fight out their problems, or at least as far as they're going to go.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   But that doesn't mean that other countries may not be involved.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   I think that it's easy to, when you live in a place like the United States or in Canada,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.000]   it's easy where most of my listeners do live, it's easy to feel protected and secure.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   I think the United States has proven time and again that she has very little to fear
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.480]   with regard to outright invasion.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.600]   Certainly you can go back and you can look at the invasion of 1812 and try to learn from
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.120]   whatever lessons there are from that period.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:22.520]   But in terms of actually invading the United States, it is an almost impossible country
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.120]   to invade from a military perspective.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   What are the reasons for that?
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.520]   Well number one, of course, the nation is massive and has the world's largest military
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:42.240]   spending, and that military spending has created a very, very significant level of military
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   infrastructure.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.400]   It's my opinion that the US military is actually quite weak, both on a relative basis
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.280]   and on an absolute basis.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:57.760]   What I mean is it's much weaker today than it was a decade ago, or a couple decades ago,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.780]   for reasons of lack of investment, lack of intelligent leadership, and also just distraction
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.640]   from the core of the mission.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.680]   It would seem to me, not being a military guy, that the military itself is quite weak.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.640]   And also just in terms of the results, what's actually happened.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.880]   To me it seems obvious that the US military hasn't won a war since World War II.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.440]   And there's been a successful campaign that we all point to of Desert Storm, and then
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.980]   it turned out that that wasn't as successful long term as anybody thought.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.200]   And so when you actually look at the results, the results are not good.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.920]   But I think that where all of the biting would be about US involvement in foreign wars, if
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:45.200]   somebody ever actually invaded the country, that would instantly unite virtually all Americans.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.680]   Because at its core, even though the American culture is one that thrives on argument, dissent,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.640]   debate, fighting, etc.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.060]   It's a very violent culture.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.120]   It's something where there would be an incredible unification.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   And due to the strong military, due to the strong militia, and I mean that in the informal
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   sense, meaning that all adults are part of the militia in terms of the local people,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.240]   due to the widespread levels of gun ownership in the United States, right, the Ukrainian
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.520]   government is handing out 10,000 rifles to anybody in Kiev.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:28.560]   I don't know what 10,000 rifles is going to do in a city of millions and millions of people,
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.280]   in a nation of tens of millions of people.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   But it's a good start.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:37.400]   In the United States, every third person has a gun collection that can arm all of their
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   neighbors.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.480]   And so in terms of defense, I don't think you would ever have any kind of military defense.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.240]   Traditionally, that's why the United States has been so concerned about intercontinental
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.080]   ballistic missiles, about nuclear threats, etc.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.560]   But I think in the modern age, the bigger threat is cyber warfare.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   I think the bigger threat is disruption due to cyber warfare.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.800]   Because the Russian military could unleash a series of cyber attacks on the United States
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   that could be broadly devastating, very, very devastating in terms of actual impact, actual
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.280]   disruption, actual empty gas stations, actual electric plants not working anymore, actual
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:30.880]   fires blown off due to voltage overloads, etc.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:38.520]   Actual widespread destruction in cities and in economies in terms of companies going down
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.600]   and main and computers being affected and software not working anymore.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   And actual effects, so whether that is most extreme levels of cyber warfare like that,
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.680]   or the more minor, just increasing levels of misinformation, argument, lack of distrust,
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.280]   more distrust between neighbors.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.880]   It's very, very serious to consider the impact in the modern age.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.160]   And so while I don't know that that would lead to the defeat of a nation or the conquering
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:14.040]   of a nation, I think it could lead to major disruptions in your and my lifestyle, major,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.600]   major costs.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.720]   What would the response then be?
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   I don't know.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.000]   I'm not a sufficient chess player.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.240]   I don't understand the dynamics at work well enough to understand where things would go,
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.080]   but it would not be good.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.000]   Let me turn attention now to what I do think is a serious, serious threat that needs to
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.360]   also be considered.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:48.640]   And I would say it would be the increasing alliance or the increasing impact in the growth
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.480]   of China.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.560]   And it would seem to me the biggest concern right now is of course Taiwan.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.240]   The Chinese government has claimed the nation of Taiwan as being its own for a very long
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   time.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.760]   The nation of Taiwan bristles at that and says, "No, we're an independent nation."
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.360]   And you have a very uncomfortable argument going on on a world basis whether Taiwan is
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.720]   a country or not.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:24.120]   China has so far held back from militarily forcing itself on Taiwan and invading Taiwan.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.820]   But you have a very powerful nation, the nation of China, which has for years systematically
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:36.520]   been working on taking over and expanding its scope and expanding its influence.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:45.200]   And many analysts have for quite a while expected China to sometime soon take action and go
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.240]   ahead and seek by force to invade Taiwan.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.480]   I don't understand myself how these countries think that their military invasion is going
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   to do any good.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:02.440]   I don't understand how the Russian nation or how President Putin could think that his
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.200]   invasion of Ukraine is going to do any good if the Ukrainian people are not with him.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.560]   But maybe I don't understand it.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:19.200]   Similarly, if the nation of Taiwan wants to be a separate and independent nation, I don't
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.960]   understand how it would do the Chinese government any good to think that they could bring them
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.800]   in by force.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.280]   But then again, throughout history it's happened, right?
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.200]   It happened in the United States when you had many states seek to secede from the federal
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   government.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.040]   The federal government went after them with force, forced them to not be able to secede,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   and it worked.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.100]   It kept the nation together.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.400]   So maybe I'm naive.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.640]   But I think there's a very good reason right now, if you are in Taiwan, there's a very
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.720]   good reason right now to take a foreign vacation, to get out for a time.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.960]   Now perhaps you are committed to fighting for the independence of Taiwan and you're
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.640]   going to take up arms against China, that's your prerogative to do so.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.440]   But if you're not going to fight and take up arms against China, this would seem like
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.280]   a pretty good time to consider taking, to at least be watching sources of information
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:18.280]   very, very carefully, and even to consider taking some significant time off for a foreign
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.560]   vacation or send your children and your family for some time abroad while you stay involved
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.400]   in your business affairs, your job, etc.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.640]   But keep a close eye on your sources of information to be able to get out.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.440]   Remember, in any kind of dangerous event like this, you have to get out before everyone
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.520]   else decides they have to get out.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.060]   You could get out of Ukraine pretty easily three weeks ago, a month ago.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.680]   You could not get out easily two days ago, three days ago, even before the invasion.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.580]   And you can't get out now.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:58.240]   If you're a military-aged man, they have conscripted you into the national defense.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.360]   And all respect to those who serve, but I don't intend to be myself conscripted into
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.920]   an army.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.060]   That doesn't line up with my idea of freedom, nor do I think it's a particularly useful
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:18.800]   way to die in terms of impactful, as a soldier sent off to war by a president to be cannon
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   fodder.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   Here's a gun, go shoot.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.680]   That's not useful service.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.160]   That's cannon fodder stuff.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   If you're going to be involved in a resistance movement, be involved in a resistance movement.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.080]   Don't be stuck into some military unit, at least not a conventional unit.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:41.800]   Be a long-range sniper or a sophisticated placer of improvised explosive devices.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.240]   Do something that's going to be impactful, not just conscripted with everyone else, at
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:51.160]   least in my opinion.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:31:00.480]   If China starts to use this event as cover for its own actions, things could get even
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.860]   more significant.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.800]   And that could happen very, very quickly.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:13.620]   Whether it is an invasion of Taiwan, whether it's something else, the point is that could
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.080]   happen very, very quickly.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   So what do you do?
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.320]   I've laid out some of my concerns.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.220]   What do you do?
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:30.240]   As I see it, all of the standard advice that I have been giving for many years applies.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.960]   And you have a couple of lines that you go down.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.720]   Number one is you engage in basic preparedness.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   You make sure, in the old days it was called civil defense.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:47.100]   Civil defense, the concept of civil defense is can you defend your nation against, can
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:56.800]   you empower civilians, non-military personnel in your nation to defend themselves effectively
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.880]   against foreign invasion?
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.720]   That was the classic concept of civil defense.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.760]   A few years ago I heard an interview with a historian, a British historian, who was
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.960]   analyzing the effectiveness of the British civil defense programs.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.560]   And I wish I could lay my hands on it for the facts and figures, but it was resoundingly
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.560]   effective.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.760]   And so what was the basic concept of civil defense?
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:26.160]   Part of it was equipping people to be independent.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   Of course, part of it was actual protection, building fallout shelters, having community
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.540]   shelters, having community air raid drills, and then providing for the storage of supplies
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.360]   and defenses of the local community.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.000]   So today we don't usually talk about this in the terms of civil defense.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.440]   These are not words that we use much.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.220]   We talk about it in terms of prepping or preparedness.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.280]   But all of the basics still exist.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:57.440]   The basics of making sure you have supplies of food, supplies of water, supplies of fuel,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.200]   supplies of medical supplies.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.320]   And if you think about it, there's what I always refer to as the commonality of disasters,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:13.640]   that it's the basic preparedness that you'd make for an event of a pandemic, some kind
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.440]   of significant pandemic, all the way to cyber warfare.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.800]   If you imagine the electricity going off to your house for a couple of weeks, what would
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.360]   you need to survive that?
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:30.140]   If you imagined that there was unrest in the streets, the stores were empty for some periods
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.120]   of weeks, what would you need to survive that?
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.000]   That's the basics of home preparedness.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And so you would almost certainly survive the effects of a few weeks of the stores being
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.760]   empty, disruptions in fuel supplies.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   You would survive that.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.560]   It's just a matter of in what comfort, in what peace does your family survive that?
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.840]   And again, just to connect the dots, how could that happen?
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:03.180]   Well, if there was some kind of cyber attack that disrupted on a broad scale, the supplies
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:09.800]   of fuel like happened with the Colonial Pipeline hack this last year.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.160]   And if there were shortages of fuel like happened this past year, such to the point that the
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.800]   18-wheelers couldn't run, things would be disrupted.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:27.920]   If that were exacerbated by some kind of wide scale attack on telecommunications infrastructure,
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:34.640]   and there were sophisticated cyber attacks on large companies, large trucking companies,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.200]   large distribution companies.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:45.920]   I mean, consider, if the Israeli government can get a worm into the Iranian nuclear centrifuges
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.600]   that cause the whole thing to blow up, then I would imagine that the Russian government
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.480]   could pretty easily get a worm into the Walmart distribution center that wrecks their ordering
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   system.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.400]   Well, imagine what happens if ordering breaks down.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.640]   I'll tell you what had happened, actually.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.120]   A few days ago, I was in a local hardware store.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.960]   I went into the hardware store and the computer system was down.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.120]   And so all the point of sale, point of service terminals were not working.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:21.920]   And so this particular hardware store, they had a backup plan, but everything was a mess.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.440]   And they had lines of all the workers were gathered up front trying to do the work.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.600]   And what they're doing is they were scanning, they were manually taking the SKU number from
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.120]   the barcode of the things that I was trying to buy, going on the company website to find
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:43.840]   the price, and then manually filling out sales tickets of that particular price so that they
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.840]   could, and creating these manual order receipts for people purchasing things.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.000]   But it took what is, of course, usually a quick and effective process, and it made it
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.640]   take five times as long, six, eight times as long as it would usually take due to the
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:06.920]   simple fact that their system wasn't working for them to take, scan the code and have the
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.600]   computer do all the totals for you on your pricing system.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.480]   Now I want you to imagine that on a more widespread basis with a company that is totally automated,
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:27.860]   such as Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe's, Kroger, Publix, any widespread store.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:37.040]   If I were in charge of the cyber warfare department in the Russian military, and I knew that one
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.680]   of our longstanding enemies was the United States, I would have a list myself of the
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.440]   top 300 companies in every industry.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:51.240]   And I'd have some kind of virus or worm ready to go to get into these company systems and
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:58.920]   blow them up, not literally, but just to drive chaos into their system.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.640]   American stores and global stores, right?
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.080]   Doesn't matter whether it's Carrefour in France or Walmart in the United States or Intermarché
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.840]   elsewhere, it's all the same.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.340]   Stores, everything is run on the just-in-time inventory system.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.960]   That's what I've, remember for years, I've talked to you about this.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:22.040]   And the just-in-time inventory system is an amazing, amazing invention of the modern age.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:28.680]   It is extraordinarily efficient, keeps prices low, and it keeps more selection on the shelves
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.600]   than anything ever imagined in human history.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:39.040]   The basic idea of the just-in-time inventory system is as a product goes out the scanner
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.880]   at the front door, then it should be coming back onto the loading dock in the back door.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:51.360]   And the companies that use this have incredibly sophisticated systems that run it.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.320]   And what has happened in the modern age is it's actually gotten better than before, where
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.480]   companies have gotten very, very good at dealing with supply line disruptions.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.320]   There have been a few empty shelves that you've seen in your local area over the past couple
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.480]   of years, but for the most part, they haven't been significant.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:15.320]   And if you look at the performance of companies like HEB in the Southwest, in light of a hurricane,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.560]   their systems are amazing.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.400]   Or Costco has done a great job with it.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.960]   If there's a hurricane or an event coming, they can quickly send supplies.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:32.800]   But all of that is built upon interconnected computer data transfer, artificial intelligent
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.660]   analysis of that data, et cetera.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.720]   So imagine some kind of cyber warfare attack.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:46.880]   Imagine that the Russian military inserts a worm into the Walmart ordering system.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:58.020]   And imagine that it has the ability just simply to disrupt that inventory system.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.480]   Everything could go haywire.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.140]   And how quickly can you bring that stuff back online?
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.100]   It's not a dark ages kind of thing.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.200]   It's not like we automatically go back to horses and buggies and single bottom plows
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.680]   and we're spending the next hundred years.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.880]   No, but it's disruptive, potentially extremely disruptive.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:27.320]   Again, I don't know the extent of this, but I guarantee, if you know that the intelligent
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:34.480]   services of the world, again, the example I like to use is when they got a worm into
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.800]   the Iranian centrifuges and made them melt down.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.720]   You know that these countries are very, very sophisticated and very good and they have
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   backup plans.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:50.280]   And this cyber warfare is a powerful, powerful form of warfare that we've really not seen.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.960]   We've never seen used.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:57.120]   And yet we know that it is part of military planning.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:04.880]   Now again, imagine something similar happening if we brought the nation of China into it.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:13.000]   Imagine if you had a conflict where China goes ahead and invades Taiwan and now the
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.720]   United States is responding, supporting its ally, Taiwan, in an actual kinetic way and
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.920]   it unleashes something like cyber warfare.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.080]   It's a very serious threat.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:34.320]   I don't think it's actually even most important to talk about things like the nuclear threat.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.200]   I think the cyber warfare threat is significant enough.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:45.720]   But I want you to remember, because our memories are short, I want you to remember how quickly
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.120]   things can go from zero to panic.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.200]   Do you remember a couple of years ago, President Trump was President of the United States and
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.320]   there was the banter back and forth with North Korea.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:05.840]   And then one day there was an alert that went out by mistake on the Hawaii emergency warning
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.520]   system saying take cover, missiles inbound, something like that.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:16.760]   I want you to remember, at no time in my life have I ever feared nuclear war.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:22.120]   But a couple of years ago, when everyone was, the big conflict between North Korea and the
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:29.280]   United States, President Trump going back and forth with President Kim Jong-un, I think
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.760]   it's un, right?
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.960]   That was a serious event and it happened quickly.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.600]   And you can see just how quickly things can emerge.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.520]   So I was giving you solutions.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   Quick preparedness comes into place, making sure that you have the ability to do without
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:55.840]   external systems of support for some weeks, a month would be ideal.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:02.760]   Of course, you can set higher targets, six months, a year is great, but it's a significantly
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.640]   higher level of commitment to go to that.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.840]   But if today you started to prepare for, what would you do?
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:15.480]   Imagine this, right, if I flip off the breaker to your house and the water supply to your
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.200]   house, what would you do to live for a month without going to the store?
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.840]   And that's prepping, that's what you basically need.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.000]   So how do you provide against that?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.080]   Talked quite a lot about it, maybe do more, used to sell a course on it, maybe I will
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.980]   in the future, if you're interested let me know.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.640]   But that's preparedness, there's plenty of information out there.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.680]   And so you should engage in that.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.800]   You should also be prepared to go someplace safe.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.480]   If ideally you should have the ability, some kind of backup plans to go from where you
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.400]   are to another place that you think would be safer.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.320]   There's some, this can be as simple as another town.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.600]   Right now there are certain cities in Ukraine that are being targeted.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.360]   If you can get out of those cities and go to other cities that are not currently being
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.760]   targeted you can improve your safety.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:15.660]   Again I don't expect hot warfare in the United States, but local events can make certain
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.880]   places undesirable.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.940]   Big cities can be especially flammable.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.680]   So do you have a safe place to go?
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.120]   If money is no option I would just keep a vacation house, a country vacation house.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.600]   It's a wonderful place to go, it's a backup place, it's out of the main city, that's a
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.840]   place that your family enjoys going.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.840]   Why?
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:43.120]   Well again, one place can be threatened by certain events.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.320]   This is where you do get to the area of what if there were actually a nuclear threat?
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   Do you have the ability to go to a place that's less of a target?
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:59.080]   Although of course you could choose your housing decisions by picking a book like Joel Skousen's
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:04.440]   Strategic Relocation which puts nuclear target maps and you analyze your state and you analyze
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:11.840]   your city based upon likely nuclear targets and likely wind flows, etc.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.640]   Most of us don't choose our housing like that.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.800]   But if you have the ability to go from a big city you'll sleep better, to a country house,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.840]   a country vacation house, you'll sleep better at night.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.200]   If you have the ability to leave a country that was involved in a conflict and go to
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.120]   a country that's not involved in a conflict you'll sleep better at night.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.360]   So this is where we get into kind of this dual fold scenario.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:41.320]   One is preparing to be secure in your home, the other is preparing to leave a place that
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.600]   is bad and go to a place that is better.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.800]   That leaving can be local, moving from a neighborhood that's threatened by floodwaters to a neighborhood
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.720]   that's not threatened by floodwaters, going inland 20 miles to get away from the significant
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.440]   risk of storm surge in a storm or wind damage.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.800]   It can be regional, seeking to go from a region that's heavily affected by an event, region
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.120]   that's affected by an event to a region that's less affected, or it can be international,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:11.360]   seeking to go from a country that is involved in some kind of international conflict to
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.640]   a neutral country, something like that.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.600]   So more on that in the days to come.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.840]   Just want to encourage you, be prepared.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.080]   Be prepared as best you can with whatever that means to you.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:31.240]   Because things have gotten significantly more perilous.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:38.680]   I hope and pray that the perilous reality in which we live at the moment calms down
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.720]   and becomes less perilous.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:46.160]   But I wanted to point out to you a couple of scenarios that are reasonable, realistic
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:52.920]   ways that things could get much more difficult in coming weeks and months.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.080]   It's worth considering those scenarios.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.560]   As I stated this morning, it's worth believing that they can happen, and then it's worth
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.200]   protecting yourself against them.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.240]   I feel like my list of preparations is incomplete.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.440]   For example, in your company, I think as best you're capable of, you should think about
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.320]   what would happen if your company suffered a cyber attack.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.760]   What would happen if your information were leaked out?
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.720]   I had planned to do a show on information privacy.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.840]   Maybe I'll do that soon.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.680]   But in light of the Give, Send, Go hack, it's important to always think about information
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.980]   privacy.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:34.480]   If you were being targeted by a hacker who's upset with your political contributions, or
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:41.520]   if you were being targeted by a cyber warfare unit in a foreign military, what could be
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.720]   made to leak out from the information?
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.160]   That's even without going to the level of paranoia of your smart devices or your connected
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   house.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.520]   Just what information would you not want to become public?
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.440]   Is that information protected as a matter of course?
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.600]   None of us are perfectly protected, but it's worth thinking about.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.000]   It's worth considering.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.800]   It's worth making sure that you have PDF backups of your bank records stored in an offline
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   file.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.600]   This is the classic conundrum.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:22.160]   The things that you do to prepare for one thing often turn out to be not so great in
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.160]   another.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.400]   An example would be having paper backups.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:30.360]   Generally, I would advise you against receiving paper statements, paper investment statements,
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.280]   paper credit card statements, paper bank statements.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:39.520]   I advise you against receiving those things because they pose, in today's world, a significant
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.960]   risk of identity theft.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.720]   A mailbox pirate comes along and gains access to the information.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.280]   The paper itself is often not well secured.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.040]   Somebody can break into your home safe or your desk drawer and often have access to
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.760]   your private information.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:02.560]   I generally believe that it is better for you to have your financial records stored
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.120]   on the encrypted website with a secure login for you, and then you can go and get them
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   when you need them.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.400]   The problem is that most of us are lazy about going and getting those records.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.920]   If Vanguard or Fidelity suffered a hack, I just want you to imagine, right?
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:28.560]   Imagine the chaos that could be strewn across the world and across American society if Vanguard
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:36.440]   were targeted by the Russian military with a sophisticated hack, a sophisticated worm
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.880]   or some kind of malicious code that is installed in it.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.040]   Vanguard, I'm sure, worked very hard to be protected from that, but they're not ready
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:51.480]   for an attack from a foreign nation state actor.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:59.440]   I spend enough time listening to talks by hackers, red team planners.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:08.560]   I spend enough time listening to them to know that a determined adversary can get into any
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.840]   organization, any computer system, etc.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:19.000]   I just have a hard time believing that if I were in charge of a cybersecurity department
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.520]   at a large foreign nation state and I had plans of how I'd disrupt the United States,
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:33.400]   again, I don't believe that I could be successful attacking the United States with an invasion
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   force.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   I don't think that I would even probably be successful attacking the United States with
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.080]   an intercontinental ballistic missile, conventional or nuclear.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.320]   That would just not be good and there would be a disproportionate response.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.840]   But I do think I could be very successful at completely disrupting the United States
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.600]   with a cyber attack.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:50:00.640]   And so if I were in charge of a cybersecurity or cyber warfare environment, I would have
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.520]   a list of the top 10 banks.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:08.240]   Bank of America, Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, just go down the list of the top 10 banks
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.480]   and imagine a sophisticated attack against those top 10 banks.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:22.040]   I would include the top 10 investment companies, Vanguard, Fidelity, even the little ones,
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.440]   like how to mess up e-trade, Robinhood, just go down the list.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.880]   I would have targets and plans and software prepared for attacking those entities.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:39.720]   And so again, imagine that the files in the computer systems are completely disabled of
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.920]   these banking and investment companies.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:49.480]   Think about the havoc that that would wreak on the US society, on the US stock market,
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.880]   on the US financial system.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.000]   It would be very, very serious.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.120]   So I don't know necessarily that having offline copies of your financial data is necessarily
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.840]   going to help you in an event like that, but it probably can't hurt.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.920]   So things like that.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:16.680]   And again, I just go back to the solutions that are realistic.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:22.360]   All day I've been tweeting pictures of lines at ATMs in Ukraine, people trying to get their
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.320]   money out of the bank.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.460]   Make sure you have cash.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.760]   Make sure that you have a plan to...
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.520]   I'm going to stop there.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.680]   I go over the solutions nonstop.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:39.000]   So just wanted to bring you some sobering commentary on what could happen from here.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.280]   And we hope that it will not happen, but things have changed dramatically in the last 18 to
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.520]   24 hours.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:52.480]   Depending on what happens in the coming days, things could change more dramatically indeed.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.040]   And wasn't it...
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:03.280]   I think there was Lenin had some kind of quote that was something like, "Sometimes you can
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.680]   go decades with only days happening and sometimes you can live decades in a couple of days."
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:13.360]   And so it's very possible that in the days to come that would be the case.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:18.880]   Be thoughtful and may God be with you and your family as we pray for and support the
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.600]   people being victimized in Ukraine and elsewhere right now.
