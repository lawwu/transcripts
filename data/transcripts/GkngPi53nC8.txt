[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   unfortunately the first few moments of this the 84th in the series of sermons on
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.360]   Christian doctrine by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones are missing due to the
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.720]   deterioration of the original master tape the doctor has arrived in this
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.080]   series of studies at the doctrine of the last judgment a doctrine against which
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.120]   all others should be understood the lack of understanding regarding this
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.880]   particular subject is largely responsible for the lack of interest in
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.960]   doctrine today says the doctor it is at this point that we join him if men and
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.480]   women only realized the truth about this last judgment well then of course they
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.500]   would flee from the wrath to come as they were exhorted to do by John the
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.400]   Baptist and by our Lord himself and by all the Apostles in their preaching it
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.120]   is therefore I feel very definitely because of the failure to grasp this
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.440]   that men and women are so concerned about their own subjective moods and
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.360]   states and just one something that will help them in this world without
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.440]   realizing that the whole of the time they live and have their being under the
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.080]   eye of God and in a sense under the judgment of God now there are I think
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.640]   certain reasons for this there are those of course in general who dislike the
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.560]   whole idea of judgment altogether those who take the so-called liberal view in
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.040]   theology they abominate this whole conception of judgment they say that's
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.320]   been the difficulty in the past that God has been pictured as a judge and they
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.360]   say the whole thought of judgment is just alien to any idea of God as a God
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.160]   of love so they they just don't believe in it at all they may believe in general
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.440]   that there is a sort of differentiation between the good and the evil and that
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.080]   that differentiation between good and evil in this world will be perpetuated in
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.000]   the next world but of course by today the vast majority of them don't even
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.360]   believe that the popular notion today is what is called universalism that
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.480]   everybody at last is going to be forgiven going to be saved and that
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   nobody will be punished in an ultimate sense at all that God in his love will
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.360]   save everybody universalism has become very popular at the present time so
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.640]   obviously if you believe that you will not be interested in the doctrine of a
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.320]   final and the last judgment and there are others who think that the only
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.240]   judgment really is the judgment that comes while we're in this life and in
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.720]   this world and that that of course is meant to be remedial they think that all
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.360]   punishment should be remedial it's an idea that comes in from the secular realm
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.480]   where you see the whole modern treatment of prisoners in prisons is based upon
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.760]   this that all punishment is remedial it's an utterly unscriptural idea
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.720]   there's nothing in the scripture to suggest that at all in fact the opposite
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   you don't improve men by punishing them in the scripture it you do that by grace
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.320]   and punishment is punishment however that is the popular idea and it's crept
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.480]   into even Christian thinking so there are many who would dislike the whole
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.640]   idea for that reason but it is interesting to observe that there are
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.080]   many whom one can describe even as evangelical Christians who are in
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.680]   trouble about this question of judgment and their difficulties is a very
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.400]   different one of course their difficulty arises in this way they say surely once
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.600]   fate is decided in this life and in this world surely the man who believes has
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   already passed from judgment into life surely they say what determines one's
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.320]   eternal destiny is whether one believes or does not believe on the Lord Jesus
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.080]   Christ and to salvation and therefore as that is something which happens while
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.560]   we're still in this world and in this life because they say you've already
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.240]   shown us that there is nothing to substantiate the idea of a second chance
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.400]   or a period of probation beyond this world well therefore they say where does
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.120]   the need of a final judgment come in at any rate as far as God's people are
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.480]   concerned now for those reasons and others there does seem to be some
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.320]   confusion with regard to this whole idea of a final or a last judgment and
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.560]   therefore perhaps the most important thing for me to do is to say this to
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.920]   define clearly what the Bible really does mean by the last of the final
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:08.340]   judgment and the important thing is this it does not represent it as something
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.440]   which is going to determine our fate it is simply the great occasion on which
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   our fate will be announced when the verdict will be promulgated it isn't the
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.840]   occasion on which the verdict will be arrived at now I think that that is
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.600]   where the last group that I refer to get into trouble they seem to think somehow
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.480]   that the idea of judgment must of necessity involve this that people will
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.560]   come to the judgment with their fates uncertain and undetermined and then the
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.360]   charge will be made and they will attempt to reply and then a judgment
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.240]   will be arrived at but it isn't that at all they are perfectly right when they
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.560]   say that our fate in this sense is already determined before we go out of
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.440]   this world before the resurrection and what happens at the last judgment is the
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.400]   promulgation of the verdict it is the occasion on which the fate of the saved
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.880]   and the lost will be pronounced by the judge eternal he won't arrive at it then
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.960]   he will simply state it now I trust that having put it like that that some of
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.480]   those difficulties have been removed so that the thing to grasp about the last
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   judgment is this that it is and whether it will be a great public event now I
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.920]   emphasize the public aspect because many seem to have the idea that the last
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.640]   judgment is something that takes place every time a person dies of course again
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.160]   that is quite wrong there is a sense of course in which our going out of this
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:10.280]   life into the next is a momentous event because by then our fate is sealed but
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.040]   that isn't the last judgment the last judgment will be right at the very end
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:22.320]   at the second coming when the dead shall be raised in the manner we saw last week
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.080]   when our bodies shall be resurrected and it will be this great public occasion
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.640]   when the fate of all will be pronounced with all hearing it and all listening to
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.920]   it when the whole world will be assembled together and the fate of every
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:51.280]   single individual will be pronounced and announced it is therefore the public
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:08:00.400]   promulgation of the eternal and the final judgment and what is the purpose
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.640]   of this well there can be only one answer to this the purpose is the glory
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:16.440]   of God it is the final assertion of the glory of God in the presence of those
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.120]   who have not given him the glory you see you you must say that the Bible says it
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:33.380]   and for this reason the essence of sin is that it refuses to give glory to God
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:39.480]   Satan stood up against God and he was attempting to detract from the glory of
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:46.400]   God and the glory of God is supreme it's over all and redemption salvation is not
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.600]   complete until the glory of God is again established finally and completely and
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.120]   the glory of God is manifested not only in the salvation of those who belong to
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:07.400]   him but also in the punishment of those who have persisted in rejecting the
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.880]   purpose therefore of the final judgment is that God may be all in all that his
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   glory his majesty may be asserted in this striking and in this signal manner
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.640]   and of course when I say the glory of God I mean the glory of God the Father
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.280]   God the Son and God the Holy Spirit you noticed how that passage of Scripture we
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.360]   read in the 21st chapter of this book of Revelation I would emphasize the way the
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.960]   Kings are to come Kings will bend the knee and cast their crowns before him
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:50.160]   the glory of the eternal God that's the object well now the next thing for me to
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.880]   establish is of course the scriptural basis of all this which I'm saying and
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.840]   of course it is abundant I'm not going to attempt to give you all the
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.320]   scriptures you can find them for yourselves but you get it in the Old
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.640]   Testament as well as in the New you remember this question asked by Abram
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:16.200]   shall not the God of the judge of all the earth do right the judge of all the
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:23.400]   earth you get it in Psalm 96 in the same way for he cometh for he cometh to judge
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:31.320]   the earth but of course it's still more explicit in the New Testament and it's
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.280]   there in many places I think the two of the most important ones first of all
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:44.240]   Acts 17 verse 31 where the Apostle Paul in preaching to those learned Athenians
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:51.120]   the stoics in the epicureans was very careful to point out to them as a part
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   of his message that the times of this ignorance God winked it but now
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.360]   commendeth all men everywhere to repent why for he hath appointed a day in which
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.280]   he will judge the whole world in righteousness by that man whom he hath
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:18.000]   appointed whereof he has given notice in that he hath raised him from the dead a
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.920]   great assertion of this last and final judgment and of course there's the
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:33.160]   famous statement in Hebrews 9 27 it is appointed unto men once to die and
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:40.280]   after death the judgment and of course in this book of Revelation as we've
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   seen recently it is here everywhere and explicitly in the 20th chapter beginning
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:55.720]   at verse 11 the section where we began to read this evening now there I've just
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.040]   picked out what I would call the most explicit the most definite the clearest
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:08.600]   statements of this fact that there is a day that it's an event not something
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.680]   that happens when we die and so on not a mere perpetuation of a division in this
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:23.000]   life but a great public occasion a day an event to which we are all moving and
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.800]   which shall take place then that need leads me to the next question who is the
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:42.160]   judge who will act as the judge and make this great pronouncement and here there
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.800]   can be very little doubt but that judgment will be given by the Lord Jesus
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.120]   Christ so that there is a sense in which you can say that God will judge but that
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:02.080]   he has deputed the actual judging to the Sun in the same way that in some passages
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.360]   of Scripture you read that God the Father is our Savior who is the Savior
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:14.320]   of all men especially them that believe yes he is the Savior but he saves
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.120]   through the Sun it is this division of labor which we saw so long ago in what
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.320]   is sometimes called the economic Trinity the father then has committed judgment
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.600]   to the Sun because he is the mediator because he is the son of men and so as
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.160]   to preclude any possibility that any men should claim that he isn't having a
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.560]   fair opportunity because God is judging men well here is one who is man as well
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   as God and judgment has been committed unto him now you will find let me give
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.480]   you some of the passages which teach that you find it of course in Matthew in
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:03.760]   the gospel according to St. Matthew chapter 25 verses 31 and 32 when the Son
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.840]   of Man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.560]   sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.520]   nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided his
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.400]   sheep from the goats but it's still more explicit of course in the fifth chapter
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   of the gospel according to St. John which is very important in this respect let me
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.320]   read to you verses 22 and 23 in this fifth chapter of the gospel according to
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.800]   St. John verse 21 perhaps father as the father raises up the dead and quickness
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:53.200]   them even so the son quickness whom he will for the father judges no men but
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.760]   hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.920]   as they honor the father he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:10.240]   father which hath sent him and in the 27th verse again we are told that the
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   father has given the son to have life in himself and hath also given him
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:24.080]   authority to execute judgment also because he is the Son of Man now there it
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.520]   is again quite explicitly and then Peter in preaching to Cornelius and his
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:34.400]   household you'll find it in the 10th of Acts verse 42 says this and he commanded
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:42.360]   us to preach and to teach the people and to testify that it is he which was
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.520]   ordained of God to be judge of quick and dead the Lord Jesus Christ gave us that
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   commandment says Peter telling us that it is he who has been ordained to be the
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.760]   judge of the quick and of the dead then I've already reminded you of Acts 1731
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.240]   where Paul says again explicitly that the judge is to be the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:13.040]   and really you have the same in Philippians 2 10 wherefore God hath
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.000]   highly exalted him that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.240]   heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and at the name of and
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.400]   so on that that he may be all in all it's the same idea but listen again to
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:38.000]   2 Timothy 4 1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.360]   shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and kingdom now there it
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.600]   is in as explicit a form as you could ever wish to have to Timothy fourth
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:57.760]   chapter and the first verse and if you read 1 Corinthians 15 you will find that
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.520]   it all links up together the kingdom has been handed for the time being to the
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.920]   Son and he is waiting until his enemy shall be made his footstool then when he
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:15.960]   returns he will exercise this judgment and then he will hand his perfect
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:23.640]   kingdom back to God the Father that God that may be all and in all it's the same
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:30.840]   idea it is what you may call if you like the mediatorial kingdom of the Son which
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.880]   includes this element of judgment so that he may hand the kingdom back in its
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:43.760]   entirety and its perfection to the Father now the next question that arises
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:51.000]   is therefore who are to be judged and here there isn't universal agreement
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.560]   there are some who say that it is only the unbelievers who will be judged and
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.840]   that the believers will not be judged because they say that they've already
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:09.640]   passed from judgment to life and that therefore this can only apply to the
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:17.440]   unbelievers but surely that cannot quite be right for this reason to start with
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.360]   the resurrection as we saw last week is of the evil and the good together and at
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   the same time not only that did you notice in the 20th chapter of the book
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:34.880]   of Revelation that we are told that two books were opened now of course this is
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:42.560]   symbolic but the symbol does stand for something and the symbol must stand for
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:50.040]   this there were two books you remember the books were opened and another book
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.960]   was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.640]   which were written in the books according to their works and you
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.220]   remember the final statement whosoever was not found written in the book of
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:12.800]   life was cast into the lake of fire and of course if you accept the idea which I
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.240]   was expounding just now that it's only the occasion of the promulgation there
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.080]   is no difficulty about this at all so that when you take all these things
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   together it does seem to be clear that on this great day believers and
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:37.360]   unbelievers will stand and appear and the judgment will be pronounced out of
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.800]   these records out of these books and you and I as believers in the Lord Jesus
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:51.240]   Christ shall hear the words well done though good and faithful servant you
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.400]   know there will be some according to our Lord in Matthew 25 who will be very
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.100]   surprised to hear that said to them you know there are some Christians who never
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.400]   have assurance of salvation it's quite wrong they should have it but for some
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.200]   reason faulty teaching perhaps perhaps partly on grounds of temperament they've
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:18.680]   never really rejoiced and been sure of their salvation there are such people
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.960]   they look so much at their own imperfections and according to our Lord
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.780]   such people will have this great surprise when they shall hear that
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:34.520]   they're amongst the redeemed they shall say when did we do this and our Lord
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.920]   will say in as much as he did it into one of these the least of my brethren he
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.760]   did it unto me you see that's the importance of this idea of the
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.200]   promulgation they will hear this wonderful word they will know for
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:56.840]   certain it will have been from it will be promulgated in this manner and
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:04.040]   therefore they will enter into this great glory that awaits them which I am
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.720]   going to describe to you in a moment so that it seems therefore that we must
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.920]   understand that the redeemed and the unredeemed the ungodly will appear to
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:22.600]   hear the promulgation of the verdict and there will be this final separation but
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:28.080]   it is also taught in the scripture that the full angels will be judged at the
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.120]   same time you remember how in the second chapter of the second epistle of Peter
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:43.600]   we are told that these full angels are reserved in chains until this day of
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.960]   judgment now there is nothing in scripture to say that the good angels
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:56.120]   will appear in this sense on this great day but it is very clear that the fallen
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.880]   angels those who listen to Satan and who went after him and who belong to him it
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:08.480]   is clear that their judgment will be promulgated and announced on this great
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.360]   day so that not only do you have the whole of mankind but also the full
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:23.760]   angels now I'm sure there's a question in the minds of many at this point they
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.240]   say what about the judgments that we read of in the twelfth chapter of the
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.560]   gospel according to st. Luke and in the third chapter of the first epistle to
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.160]   the Corinthians and in the fifth chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.360]   what about those do you remember how our Lord teaches there in that twelfth
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.280]   chapter of Luke's gospel about servants being beaten with many stripes and few
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:55.440]   stripes and so on there seems to be a differentiation there in the reward and
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.240]   then you remember how Paul very explicitly in 1 Corinthians 3 teaches
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:07.560]   that he says every man's work shall be judged the day will declare it that's
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   why a man's got to be very careful how he builds upon the only foundation which
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.280]   is Jesus Christ and him crucified because you can build with wood and hay
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.720]   and stubble or precious metals but it's going to be tried every man's work shall
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.360]   be tried as by fire and if it's wood and hay and stubble it'll all be burnt away
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:33.240]   there'll be nothing left yes is full but though a man's work may be burnt away
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:39.840]   like that he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire now what's that ask
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.800]   someone that seems to suggest some special kind of judgment for believers
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:52.320]   and again in 2 Corinthians 5 we read we must all appear before the judgment seat
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:24:02.240]   of Christ and given account of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad now
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.960]   he's writing there obviously to Christian people and as only Christian
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:14.240]   believers in his mind what is this someone may ask well the answer is this
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:22.600]   surely that we are taught clearly in the scripture that there is a differentiation
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:28.560]   amongst believers now this is not from the standpoint of salvation Paul has
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.320]   established that quite clearly in 1 Corinthians 3 though a man's work may be
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:39.160]   entirely burned away he himself shall be saved by what will by the grace of God
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.560]   he's on the foundation Jesus Christ and him crucified that's what saves a man
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.880]   our actions our works don't save us we are saved by grace through faith it is
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:58.320]   our trusting to the Lord and his perfect work that redeems us and saves us ah yes
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:06.200]   but our works do make a difference and they do count so that though we are all
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:14.120]   saved it does not mean that we'll be identical or in identical positions take
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.880]   out Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 15 one star different from another star in glory
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:26.040]   they're not all identical and Christian people will not all be identical don't
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:33.000]   misunderstand me at this point we shall all be in glory we shall all be saved
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.360]   nevertheless there is this clear teaching that our works will be
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   considered our works subsequent to our salvation not in our justification but
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:52.440]   in this matter of our reward it's very difficult for us to understand this it's
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.120]   difficult for us to understand how we shall all be supremely happy and yet
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.680]   there shall be a difference but it is clearly taught in the scripture and that
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.440]   is why I have to put it before you and that is why the Apostle Paul you see uses
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.600]   language like this knowing therefore the terror of the Lord I persuade men it's
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.480]   because he knows he's got to appear there and give an account of his
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:26.480]   stewardship as a preacher that he is so zealous and so constant in his labors
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:33.680]   he's got to appear before the judgment throne of Christ very well then let's
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   keep those two ideas separately in our minds we are not told whether this
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:47.640]   judgment for rewards as we may describe it takes place in connection with this
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.800]   great day of judgment or afterwards we are just not told all we are told is
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.280]   that there is this discrimination this differentiation according to what we've
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.440]   done as Christians whether it happens on the great day of judgment or
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.920]   subsequently we don't know but it is right and good that as Christian people
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:16.640]   we should always be bearing this in mind we shall all have to give an account of
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.600]   the deeds done in the body we are told about the blessed dead in the 14th
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.160]   chapter of this book of Revelation and their works to follow them don't forget
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   that there is a danger I sometimes think that in our emphasis upon justification
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:38.960]   by faith only that we fall into the error of forgetting that there is this
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:49.800]   further differentiation on the basis of our works our faithfulness as Christian
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.960]   people we have to fight for the great doctrine of justification by faith it's
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.720]   constantly being attacked but it would be a very grievous thing that if in
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:07.640]   defending that and in asserting that as we must do we in any way detracted from
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:13.960]   this other teaching which reminds Christian people that all their works
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:20.160]   are observed by the Lord the righteous judge and that what you and I do as
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:27.280]   Christians in this world is going to have an effect upon our life in glory in
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:34.320]   the next one now don't misunderstand it there will be no sorrow there will be no
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.640]   sighing there will be no unhappiness there will be no misery there will be no
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:46.360]   weeping we shall all be perfectly and entirely happy and full of bliss and of
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:54.240]   joy and yet there will be these differences I mustn't speculate I
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.920]   sometimes have wondered whether it means something like this that the one who has
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:09.200]   been most faithful shall be a little nearer to him I don't know it may be we
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:16.160]   shall all see but perhaps some will be nearer than others I don't know but that
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.360]   there is a difference I say is made plain and clear in the scriptures very
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.400]   well there is in essence the biblical teaching on the last the final judgment
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:36.960]   and that of course leads to the final or the eternal state here is the
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:49.840]   promulgation of the great sentence there are unbelievers and they will go to hell
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:30:02.680]   the second death they are described as outside and they go to that eternal
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:09.000]   condition now we've already considered the question of eternal punishment so we
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.320]   don't go into it again I gave you evidence which seemed to me to be
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.640]   sufficient to reject entirely the teaching about conditional immortality
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:25.080]   you will remember I take the word eternal to mean what it says both as
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.480]   regards eternal life and eternal or everlasting destruction out of the
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:40.760]   presence of God we leave it at that there are the scriptures there are all
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:47.840]   work abominations who are liars you notice the description outside outside
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:58.920]   the life of God continuing this sinful state and condition wretched unhappy but
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.640]   let's not end on that note let us end on the other the great object of redemption
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.240]   is to help us to see the final fate of those who have believed those who are in
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.320]   Christ and here it is in all its glory you've got it to perfection in that 21st
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.800]   chapter of the book of Revelation remember it's in symbols again but what
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:27.240]   a picture it is a new heavens and a new earth Peter has spoken of it in his
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.000]   second epistle in the third chapter and there shall be a new heavens and a new
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.120]   earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and you and I shall be in that we shall have
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.800]   been raised our bodies will have been raised our bodies will have been
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.640]   glorified yes the complete men shall have been redeemed body mind and spirit
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.360]   entirely delivered from sin and what shall we do in this perfect state why am
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.600]   why is my body raised and redeemed evidently I shall be using it and I
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:08.840]   shall and I shall be using it in this new earth under the new heavens you
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.160]   remember the present earth and heavens shall be destroyed the elements shall
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.680]   melt with fervent heat etc there should be a great disintegration now people
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.320]   have disagreed about this some say that the entire present earth and heavens
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.880]   will be completely and finally destroyed and that God will create a new earth and
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:35.960]   the new heavens and there are others who say no what will happen will be that all
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.680]   evil and sin will be burned out of the present one and it will be such a
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:48.440]   profound change that you can describe it as a regeneration a new beginning in a
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.320]   sense because it'll be so different well it doesn't matter of course which it is
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   and we can't finally decide it if you're interested in the history of it the
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.600]   Lutherans have always taught a new creation of heavens and earth whereas
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.280]   the Reformed have generally taught that it's the present one so delivered from
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:14.400]   evil and sin that it is virtually entirely and completely new but
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:21.440]   whichever is true the important thing is to realize is this that we shall dwell
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.880]   in the kind of condition that is described in this revelations 21 no
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:39.920]   sorrow no sign a perfect state of affairs again we must avoid speculation
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.760]   but it does seem to me to be quite clear that our heaven in a sense will be
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:54.560]   living in this perfect world that God will make his tabernacle with men the
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.720]   new Jerusalem descends you remember on to the earth and it is there we shall
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:07.040]   live in this wonderful city this new Jerusalem then will be fulfilled what
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.640]   Isaiah prophesies in the 11th chapter of his prophecy and again in the 65th when
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.240]   nature will be no longer red in tooth and claw the lion will lie down with a
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:24.080]   lamb and the wolf will eat his straw with the ox and so on the whole creation
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.760]   will have been delivered from the bondage of corruption and will be
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.240]   enjoying this glorious liberty of the children of God everything will be
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:40.000]   glorified even nature itself and that seems to me to be the biblical teaching
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.160]   about the eternal state that what we call heaven if you like is life in this
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:54.840]   perfect world as God intended men to live in he put him in paradise at the
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.520]   beginning men fell and all fell with him but again men is meant to live in the
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:08.240]   body in a glorified body in a glorified world and God will be with men whether
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:15.320]   we shall also share that ultimate heaven in which God dwells we are not told and
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:21.520]   there is a sense in which we don't need to know for what is important for us is
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:32.480]   to know this that we shall be forever with the Lord ever enjoying the glory of
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:40.360]   God basking in it reflecting it growing in it enjoying it that will be our
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:50.240]   eternal state our final destiny and that will be our everlasting and eternal
