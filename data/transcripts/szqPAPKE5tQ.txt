[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.660]   Today, we are discussing memory,
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.340]   in particular, how to improve your memory.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.660]   Now, the study of memory is one
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.700]   that dates back many decades.
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.360]   And by now, there's a pretty good understanding
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.860]   of how memories are formed in the brain,
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.300]   the different structures involved
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.220]   and some of the neurochemicals involved.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.620]   We will talk about some of that today.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.820]   Often overlooked, however,
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.580]   is that memories are not just about learning.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.160]   Memories are also about placing your entire life
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.580]   into a context.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.180]   And that's because what's really special about the brain,
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.040]   and in particular, the human brain,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.500]   is its ability to place events in the context
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.660]   of past events, the present, and future events,
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.980]   and sometimes even combinations of the past and present,
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.460]   or present and future, and so on.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.820]   So when we talk about memory,
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.300]   what we're really talking about
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020]   is how your immediate experiences relate
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.220]   to previous and future experiences.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.320]   Today, I'm going to make clear how that process occurs.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.820]   Even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.140]   I promise to put it into language
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.300]   that anyone can access and understand.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.620]   And we are going to talk about the science
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.700]   that points to specific tools
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.400]   for enhancing learning and memory.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.100]   We're also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.260]   There are, of course, instances
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.380]   in which we would like to forget things.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.660]   And that too is a biological process
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.540]   for which great tools exist to, for instance,
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.320]   eliminate or at least reduce the emotional load
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980]   of our previous experience that you really did not like,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.000]   or that perhaps even was traumatic to you.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.100]   So today, you're going to learn about the systems
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.320]   in the brain and body that establish memories.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.340]   You're going to learn why certain memories
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.300]   are easier to form than others.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.640]   And I'm going to talk about specific tools
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.900]   that are grounded in not just one,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.860]   not just a dozen, but well over a hundred studies
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.620]   in animals and humans that point to specific protocols
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.380]   that you can use in order to stamp down
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.980]   learning of particular things more easily.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.620]   And you can also leverage that same knowledge
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.260]   to better forget or unload the emotional weight
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.540]   of experiences that you did not like.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.060]   We are also going to discuss topics
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.980]   like deja vu and photographic memory.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.980]   And for those of you that do not have a photographic memory,
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.820]   and I should point out
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.480]   that I do not have a photographic memory either.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.360]   Well, you will learn how to use your visual system
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.220]   in order to better learn visual and auditory information.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.560]   There are protocols to do this
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.100]   grounded in excellent peer-reviewed research.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.940]   So while you may not have a true photographic memory,
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.140]   by the end of the episode, you will have tools in hand,
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.760]   or I should say tools in mind or in eyes and mind
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.340]   to be able to encode and remember specific events
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340]   better than you would otherwise.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.220]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.380]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.240]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.060]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.060]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.460]   to the general public.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.520]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.380]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.860]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.540]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.420]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.660]   Many times on this podcast,
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.700]   I've talked about the incredible relationship
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.380]   between temperature and sleep,
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.300]   as well as temperature and wakefulness.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.460]   Many people aren't aware of this,
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.980]   but waking up in the morning
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.180]   is in part the consequence of your body heating up
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.140]   and falling asleep at night and remaining in deep sleep
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.480]   is in part the consequence of your body temperature
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.160]   dropping by one to three degrees.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.060]   So it's vitally important that the temperature
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.660]   of your sleeping environment is controlled.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.180]   I've had trouble over the years falling and staying asleep,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.300]   or I should say falling asleep
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.700]   hasn't been so much of an issue for me,
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.860]   but waking up two or three or four hours later
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.060]   has been an issue.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.140]   Oftentimes I'm too warm, I need to open a window,
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.140]   I need to adjust the temperature of the room and so on.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.140]   Eight Sleep mattress covers are terrific
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.900]   because you can program the specific patterns of temperature
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.500]   that you want in your bed, or I should say below you
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.160]   coming from the mattress throughout the night.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.860]   So I've programmed my Eight Sleep
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.780]   to put my mattress into a state of coolness
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.140]   in order to fall asleep,
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.980]   and then to get slightly cooler as the night goes on
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.580]   to get into even deeper sleep,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.860]   and then to warm up as morning approaches.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.480]   As mentioned before, Eight Sleep mattresses
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.060]   can be used for cooling and heating.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.660]   So some of you may actually need to heat your mattress
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.280]   and Eight Sleep's terrific for that.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.100]   For me, I use Eight Sleep to keep the mattress really cool.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.300]   And I have to say,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.700]   even though I thought I was sleeping pretty well before,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.280]   I have not experienced the sort of sleep
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.980]   that I've been getting with Eight Sleep until now
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.700]   by creating this descending temperature
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.900]   in the beginning part of the night,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.780]   cooler, cooler, cooler, and then warming up towards morning
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.500]   even has a nice little vibration function.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.940]   So I wake up now to a slightly vibrating bed
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.340]   and the sleep that I'm getting is just amazing.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.300]   And I feel so much better during the day as a consequence.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.660]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.220]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.980]   Eight Sleep currently ships within the USA, Canada,
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.980]   and the UK.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.220]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.220]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.340]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.060]   And to be quite honest, I don't like the word nootropics
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.580]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.620]   And there really isn't a neuroscience of smart.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.700]   Of course, there is this notion of intelligence,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.180]   but we now know there are lots of different forms
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.280]   of intelligence.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.660]   Also, as a neuroscientist,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.300]   we don't really think about intelligence.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.000]   We think about the particular types of operations
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.980]   that you want your brain to perform in different contexts.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.480]   So for instance, some tasks and life experiences
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.580]   require that you remember information better.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.780]   Other tasks and life experiences and forms of learning
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.840]   involve focus and task switching.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.320]   Others, creativity, and so on and so on.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.620]   So the word nootropics is too much of a catchall
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.460]   or throwaway phrase to appeal to me.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.060]   Thesis understands this.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.960]   And what they've done is they've created nootropics
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.240]   that are each designed toward a particular end goal.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.040]   For instance, they have blends for focus,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.300]   blend for motivation, a blend for clarity.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.700]   They use only the highest quality ingredients,
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.480]   things like Alpha GPC and phosphatidylserine.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.440]   I've been using Thesis for close to six months now,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.320]   and I can confidently say their nootropics
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.860]   have been a game changer for me.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.300]   I often take the clarity formula
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.780]   prior to long bouts of work, meaning cognitive work,
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.280]   and the energy formula prior to physical workouts.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.500]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.140]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.460]   take a three-minute quiz,
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.520]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.180]   to try in your first month.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.440]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.100]   and use the code Huberman at checkout

[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.320]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.720]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.220]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.780]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.780]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.620]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.020]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.260]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.820]   can only be assessed from a quality blood test.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.580]   One of the challenges with a lot of blood tests
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.300]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.820]   is that you'll get the numbers back
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.440]   and get information about your blood lipids
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.960]   and hormones and so forth,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   but there are no directives
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.820]   as to what to do with that information.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.460]   Inside Tracker has solved that problem
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.940]   by creating a very easy to use dashboard.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.100]   So you'll get your numbers back
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.020]   and you can see what's in range and what's out of range,
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.640]   and then they will point you
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.600]   to specific nutritional supplementation and behavioral tools
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.360]   that will allow you to bring those numbers
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.220]   into the proper ranges for you.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.220]   I find that immensely beneficial
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.880]   because just having a bunch of data
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.960]   without any knowledge of what to do with that data
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.700]   is more overwhelming than having no data at all, frankly.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.140]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.000]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.760]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.780]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.340]   Okay, let's talk about memory
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.840]   and let's talk about how to get better
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.420]   at remembering things.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.220]   In order to address both of those things,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.460]   we need to do a little bit of brain science 101 review,
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.580]   and I promise this will only take two minutes,
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.860]   and I promise that even if you don't have a background
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.640]   in biology, it will make sense.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.780]   We are constantly being bombarded with physical stimuli,
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.420]   patterns of touch on our skin,
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.100]   light to our eyes, light to our skin for that matter,
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.820]   smells, tastes, and sound waves.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.620]   In fact, if you can hear me saying this right now,
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.020]   well, that's the consequence of sound waves
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.660]   arriving into your ears through headphones, a computer,
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.660]   or some other speaker device.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.560]   Each one of and all of those sensory stimuli
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.120]   are converted into electricity and chemical signals
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.400]   by your so-called nervous system,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.580]   your brain, your spinal cord,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.860]   and all their connections with the organs of the body
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.560]   and all the connections of your organs of the body
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.460]   back to your brain and spinal cord.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.620]   One of the primary jobs of your nervous system, in fact,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.020]   is to convert physical events in the world
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.920]   that are non-negotiable, right?
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.680]   Photons of light are photons of light.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.820]   Sound waves are sound waves.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.140]   There's no changing that,
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.140]   but your nervous system does change that.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.280]   It converts those things into electrical signals
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.720]   and chemical signals,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.180]   which are the language of your nervous system.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.620]   Now, just because you're being bombarded
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.880]   with all this sensory information
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.840]   and it's being converted into a language
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.820]   that neurons and the rest of your nervous system
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.360]   can understand does not mean that you are aware of it all.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.020]   In fact, you are only going to perceive a small amount
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.760]   of that sensory information.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400]   For instance, if you can hear me speaking right now,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.420]   you are perceiving my voice,
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.620]   but you are also most likely neglecting the feeling
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.680]   of the contact of your skin
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.980]   with whichever surface you happen to be sitting
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.740]   or standing on.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.740]   So it is only by perceiving a subset,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.820]   a small fraction of the sensory events in our environment
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.400]   that we can make sense of the world around us.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.280]   Otherwise we would just be overwhelmed
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.620]   with all the things that are happening
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.480]   in any one given moment.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   Now, memory is simply a bias in which perceptions
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.200]   will be replayed again in the future.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.980]   Anytime you experience something,
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.560]   that is the consequence of specific chains of neurons
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.320]   that we call neural circuits being activated.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.540]   And memory is simply a bias in the likelihood
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.580]   that that specific chain of neurons
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.080]   will be activated again.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.420]   So for instance, if you can remember your name,
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.440]   and I certainly hope that you can,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.620]   well, that means that there are specific chains of neurons
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.140]   in your brain that represent your name.
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.220]   And when those neurons connect with one another
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.380]   and communicate electrically with one another
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.660]   in a particular sequence, you remember your name.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.220]   Were that particular chain of neurons to be disrupted,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.400]   you would not be able to remember your name.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.960]   Now, this might seem immensely simple,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.820]   but it raises this really interesting question,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.960]   which we talked about before,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.720]   which is why do we remember certain things and not others?
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.040]   Because according to what I've just said,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.140]   as you go through life,
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.860]   you're experiencing things all the time.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.860]   You're constantly being bombarded with sensory stimuli.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.880]   Some of those sensory stimuli you perceive,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.260]   and only some of those perceptions
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.020]   get stamped down as memories.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.480]   Today, I'm going to teach you how certain things
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.880]   get stamped down as memories.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.800]   And I'm going to teach you how to leverage that process
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.160]   in order to remember the information that you want
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.300]   far better.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.840]   Now, even though I've told you that a memory
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.340]   is simply a bias in the likelihood
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.560]   that a particular chain of neurons will be activated
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.980]   in a particular sequence again and again,
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.260]   it doesn't operate on its own.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.620]   In fact, most of what we remember
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.200]   takes place in a context of other events.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.780]   So for instance, you can most likely remember your name,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.500]   and yet you're probably not thinking about
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.040]   when it was that you first learned your name.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.420]   This generally happens
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.580]   when we are very, very young children.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.220]   And yet I'm guessing you could probably remember
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.580]   a time when someone mispronounced your name
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.260]   or made fun of your name.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.140]   Or as the case was for me,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.860]   I got to the third grade and there were two Andrews.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.900]   And sadly for me, I lost the coin flip
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.140]   that allowed me to keep Andrew.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.460]   And from about third grade until about 12th grade,
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.980]   people called me Andy, which I really did not prefer.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.060]   So if you call me Andy in the comments,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.900]   I'll delete your comment.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.980]   Just kidding, doesn't bother me that much.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.440]   But eventually I reclaimed Andrew as my name.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.460]   Well, it was mine to begin with and throughout,
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.280]   but I started going by Andrew again.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.120]   Why do I say this?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.140]   Well, there's a whole context to my name for me.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.520]   And there may or may not be a whole context
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.620]   to your name for you.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.000]   But presumably if you asked your parents
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.960]   why they named you your given name,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.940]   you'll get a context, et cetera.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.800]   That context reflects the activation
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.980]   of other neural circuits that are also related
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.500]   to other events in your life, not just your name,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.580]   but probably your siblings names and who your parents are
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.020]   and on and on and on.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.200]   And so the way memory works is that each individual thing
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.980]   that we remember or that we want to remember
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.700]   is linked to something by either a close,
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.540]   a medium or a very distant association.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.900]   This turns out to be immensely important.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.080]   I know many of you will read or will encounter programs
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.340]   that are designed to help you enhance your memory.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.500]   You have these phenoms that can remember 50 names
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.060]   in a room full of people,
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.060]   or they can remember a bunch of names of novel objects
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.820]   or maybe even in different languages.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.520]   And oftentimes that's done by association.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.020]   So people will come up with little mental tricks
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.260]   to either link the sound of a word
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.520]   or the meaning of a word in some way that's meaningful
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   for them and will enhance their memory.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.080]   That can be done and is impressive when we see it.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.340]   And for those of you who can do that, congratulations.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.060]   Most of us can't do that,
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.220]   or at least it requires a lot of effort and training.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.520]   However, there are things that we can do
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.700]   that leverage the natural biology of our nervous system
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.700]   to enhance learning and memory of particular perceptions
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.900]   and particular information.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.420]   Let's first just talk about the most basic ways
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.860]   that we learn and remember things
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.180]   and how to improve learning and memory.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.140]   And the most basic one is repetition.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.100]   Now the study of memory and the role of repetition
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.660]   actually dates back to the late 1800s, early 1900s,
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.780]   when Ebbinghaus developed the first
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.020]   so-called learning curves.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.840]   Now learning curves are simply what results
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.480]   when you quantify how many repetitions of something
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.100]   are required in order to remember something.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.960]   In fact, it's been said that Ebbinghaus liberated
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.560]   the understanding of learning from the philosophers
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.480]   by generating these learning curves.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.320]   What do you mean by that?
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.960]   Well, before Ebbinghaus came along,
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.420]   learning and memory were thought to be philosophical ideas.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.480]   Ebbinghaus came along and said,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.980]   well, let's actually take some measurements.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.200]   Let's measure how well I can remember a sequence of words
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.660]   or a sequence of numbers if I just repeat them.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.780]   So what Ebbinghaus did is he would take a sequence
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.700]   of numbers or words on a page and he would read them.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.740]   And then he would take a separate sheet of paper
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.720]   and we have to presume he didn't cheat.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.140]   And he would write down as many of them as he could
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.140]   and he would try and keep them in the same sequence.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.980]   Then he would compare to the original list
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.780]   and he would see how many errors he made.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.340]   And you do this over and over and over again.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.740]   And as you would expect,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.620]   early in the training and the learning,
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.340]   it took a lot more repetitions to get the sequence correct.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.900]   And over time, it took fewer sequences.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.580]   And he referred to that difference
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.300]   in the initial number of repetitions that he had to perform
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.340]   versus the later number of repetitions
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.140]   that he had to perform as a so-called savings.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.940]   So he literally thought of the brain
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.660]   as having to generate a kind of a currency of effort.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.000]   And he talked about savings as the reduction
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.340]   in the amount of effort that he had to put forward
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.740]   in order to learn information.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.900]   And what he got was a learning curve.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.640]   And you can imagine what that learning curve looked like.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.580]   It was at a very sharp peak at the beginning
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.180]   that dropped off over time.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.260]   And of course he remembered
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.240]   all this meaningless information.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.660]   But even though the information
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.660]   might've been meaningless, the experiment itself
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.860]   and what Ebbinghaus demonstrated was immensely meaningful
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.760]   because what it said was that with repetition,
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.600]   we can activate particular sequences of neurons.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   And that repeated activation lays down
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.080]   what we call a memory.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.820]   And that might all seem like a big duh,
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.960]   but prior to Ebbinghaus, none of that was known.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.140]   Now I should also say Ebbinghaus,
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.540]   because of when he was alive,
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.200]   was not aware of these things that we call neural circuits.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.360]   It was in 1906 that Golgi and Cajal got the Nobel prize
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.800]   for actually showing that neurons are independent cells
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.920]   connected by synapses,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.220]   these little gaps between them where they communicate.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.780]   So he may have been aware of that,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.140]   but the whole notion of neural circuits
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.440]   hadn't really come about.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.760]   Nevertheless, what the Ebbinghaus learning curves
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.340]   really established was that sheer repetition,
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.220]   just repeating things over and over and over again
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.500]   is sufficient to learn.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.560]   Something that no doubt had been observed before,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.860]   but it had never been formally quantified.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.260]   Now, if we look at that result,
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.420]   there's something really important
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.140]   that lies a little bit cryptic.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.540]   That's not so obvious to most people,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.900]   which is the information that he was trying to learn
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.440]   wasn't any more interesting the second time
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.780]   than it was the first,
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.700]   probably was even less interesting
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.820]   and less and less interesting with each repetition.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.140]   And yet it was sheer repetition
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.900]   that allowed him to remember.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.020]   Now, sometime later in the early to mid 1920s,
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.500]   a psychologist in Canada named Donald Hebb
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.060]   came up with what was called Hebb's postulate.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   And Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking,
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.060]   is this idea that if a sequence of neurons is active
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.500]   at the same time or at roughly the same time,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.880]   that that would lead to a strengthening of the connections
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.380]   between those neurons.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.460]   And many, many decades of experimentation later,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.020]   we now know that postulate to be true.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.780]   Neurons themselves are not smart.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.420]   They don't have knowledge.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.660]   So every memory is the consequences, I told you before,
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.300]   of the repeated activation of a particular chain of neurons.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.640]   And what Ebbinghaus showed through repetition
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.980]   and what Donald Hebb proposed,
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.620]   and it was eventually verified through experimentation
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.340]   on animals and humans,
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.480]   was that if you encourage the co-activation of neurons,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.220]   meaning have neurons fire at roughly the same time,
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.960]   they will strengthen their connections.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.940]   It leads to a bias in the probability
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.160]   that those neurons will be active again.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.500]   Now, this is vitally important
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.820]   because nowadays we hear a lot about how memories
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.460]   are the consequence of new neurons added in the brain,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.340]   or that every time you learn something,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.780]   a new connection in your brain forms.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.820]   Well, sorry to break it to you,
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.100]   but that's simply not the case.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.800]   Most of the time, and I want to emphasize most, not all,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.940]   but most of the time when we learn something,
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.400]   it's because existing neurons, not new neurons,
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.460]   but existing neurons strengthen their connection
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.940]   through co-activation over and over and over
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.060]   through repetition, or, and this is a very important or,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.060]   or through very strong activation once and only once.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.900]   In fact, there's something called one trial learning
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.980]   whereby we experience something
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.300]   and we will remember that thing forever.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.100]   This is often most associated with negative events,
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.000]   and I'll explain why in a few minutes,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.940]   but it can also be associated with positive events,
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.960]   like the first time you saw your romantic partner
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.660]   or something that happened with that romantic partner,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.380]   or the first time that you saw your child,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.920]   or any other positive event,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.820]   as well as any other extremely negative event.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.740]   So again, both repetition,
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.900]   and I guess we could label it intensity,
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.620]   but what we really mean when we say intensity
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.240]   is strong activation of neurons can lay down these traces,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.620]   these circuits that are far more likely to be active again,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.820]   than had there not been repetition
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.220]   or not some strong activation of those circuits.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.320]   So with that in mind,
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.860]   let's return to the original contrarian question
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.720]   that I raised before,
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.760]   which is why do we remember anything?
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.380]   Every day you wake up,
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.140]   your neurons in your brain and body are active,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.780]   different neural circuits are active,
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.140]   and yet you only remember a small fraction
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.540]   of the things that happen each day,
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.060]   and yet you retain a lot of information from previous days
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.580]   and the days before those and so on.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.260]   It is only with a lot of repetition
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.100]   or with extremely strong activation
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.060]   of a given neural circuit that we will create new memories.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.900]   And so in a few minutes,
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.000]   I'll explain how to get extremely strong activation
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.980]   of particular neural circuits.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.080]   Repetition is pretty obvious, repetition is repetition,
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.620]   but in a few minutes,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.980]   I'll illustrate a whole set of experiments
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.340]   and a whole set of tools
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.140]   that point to how you can get extra strong activation
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.620]   of a given neural circuit as it relates to learning
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.180]   so that you will remember that information,
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.840]   perhaps not just with one trial of learning,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.500]   but certainly with far fewer repetitions
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.380]   than would be required otherwise.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.500]   Before we go any further,
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.020]   I want to preface the discussion by saying
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.020]   that there are a lot of different kinds of memory.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.700]   In fact, were you to take a voyage
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.180]   into the neuroscience and or psychology of memory,
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.460]   you would find an immense number of different terms
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.760]   to describe the immense number of different types of memory
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.880]   that researchers focus on.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.680]   But for sake of today's discussion,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.760]   really just want to focus on short-term memory,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.400]   medium-term memory and long-term memory.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.320]   And while there's still debate,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.500]   as is always the case with scientists, frankly,
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.380]   about the exact divisions between short-term,
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.120]   medium and long-term memory,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.740]   we can broadly define short-term memory and long-term memory
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.220]   and we can describe a couple of different types of those
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.020]   that I think you can relate to in your everyday life.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.660]   The most common form of short-term memory
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.180]   that we're going to focus on is called working memory.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.720]   Working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.880]   in mind for some period of time,
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.180]   but the expectation really isn't
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.780]   that you would remember those numbers the next day
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.220]   and certainly not the next week.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.780]   So a good example would be a phone number.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.480]   If I were to tell you a phone number, 4932938,
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.980]   well, you could probably remember it 4932938,
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.420]   but if I came back tomorrow and asked you
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.420]   to repeat that chain of numbers, most likely you would not,
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.180]   unless of course we used a particular tool
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.180]   to stamp down that memory into your mind
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.040]   and commit it to long-term memory.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.580]   Now, of course, in this day and age,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.820]   most people have phone numbers programmed into their phone.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.620]   They don't really have to remember the exact numbers.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.900]   It's usually done by contact identity and so forth.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.960]   So a different example
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.060]   that some of you are probably more familiar with
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.900]   would be those security codes.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.180]   So you try and log on to an app or a website
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.860]   and it asks you for a security code
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.580]   that's been sent to your text messages
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.940]   and then you can either plug that in directly in some cases
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.340]   or you have to remember that short sequence
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.580]   of anywhere usually from six to seven,
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.780]   sometimes eight numbers.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.860]   Your ability to do that, to switch back and forth
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:45.560]   between web pages or apps and plug in that number
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.780]   by remembering the sequence and plugging it in
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.800]   by texting or keying it in on your keyboard,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.100]   that's a really good example of working memory.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.380]   Long-term memory of the sort
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.420]   that we're going to be talking a lot about today
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.320]   is your ability to commit certain patterns of information,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.620]   either cognitive information or motor information, right?
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.560]   The ability to move your limbs in a particular sequence
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.380]   over long periods of time,
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.260]   such that you could remember it a day or a week or a month
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.900]   or maybe even a year or several years later.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.600]   So we've got short-term memory and long-term memory
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.900]   and we've got this working memory,
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.140]   which is kind of keeping something online,
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.980]   but then discarding it, okay?
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.780]   Not online on a computer, but online within your brain.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.380]   There are also two major categories of memory
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.540]   that I'd like you to know about.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.460]   One is explicit memory.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.140]   So this is not necessarily explicit of the sort
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.960]   that you're used to thinking about,
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.420]   but rather the fact that you can declare you know something.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.500]   So you have an explicit memory of your name.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.380]   Presumably you have an explicit memory of the house
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.340]   or the apartment that you grew up in.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.700]   You know something and you know you know it
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.700]   and you can declare it.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.620]   So I can ask you,
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.780]   what was the color of the first car that you owned?
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.660]   Or what is the color of your romantic partner's hair?
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.480]   These sorts of things.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.740]   That's an explicit declarative memory,
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:04.100]   but you also have explicit procedural memories.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.300]   Now, procedural memories, as the name suggests,
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.980]   involve action sequences.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.620]   The simplest one, it's almost ridiculously simple,
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.460]   is walking.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.300]   If I say, how is it that you walk from one room
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.460]   to the other, you'd probably say,
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.960]   well, I go that direction, then I turn left.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.820]   I say, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.700]   How is it exactly that you do it?
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.220]   And say, well, I move my left foot,
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.100]   then my right foot, then my left foot.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.860]   And you could describe that.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.940]   So it's an explicit procedural memory.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.660]   So much so that if you were going to teach a young toddler
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.660]   how to walk, you would probably say,
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.840]   okay, good, good, try.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.940]   Okay, and you, you know,
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.620]   probably that's going to be pre-language for the toddler,
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.040]   but you're going to encourage them to move one leg
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.880]   than the other.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.100]   And you're going to encourage and reward them
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.700]   for moving one leg than the other
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.420]   because you have an explicit procedural memory
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.980]   of how to walk.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.580]   Okay, almost ridiculously simple,
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.660]   maybe even truly ridiculously simple.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.340]   But nonetheless, when you think about it in the context
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.220]   of neural circuits and neural firing, pretty amazing.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.220]   Even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories,
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.860]   both declarative and procedural explicit memories
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.980]   can be moved from explicit to implicit.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.980]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.520]   Well, in the example of walking,
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.600]   you might've chuckled a little bit
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.180]   or kind of shook your head and said,
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.740]   that's a ridiculous thing to ask.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.180]   How do I walk from one room to the next?
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.900]   I just walk, I just do it.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.980]   Ah, well, what is just do it?
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.380]   What it is is that you have an implicit understanding,
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.660]   meaning your nervous system knows how to walk
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.460]   without you actually having to think about
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.100]   what you know about how to walk.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.380]   You just get up out of your chair
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.460]   or you get up out of bed and you walk.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.260]   In the brain, you have a structure.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.980]   In fact, you have one on each side of your brain.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.460]   It's called the hippocampus.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.900]   The hippocampus literally means seahorse.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.780]   Anatomists like to name brain structures after things
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.480]   that they think those brain structures resemble.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.100]   When I look at the hippocampus,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.960]   frankly, it doesn't look like a seahorse,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.440]   which either reflects my lack of understanding
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.780]   of what a seahorse really looks like, a visual deficit,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.240]   or I think it's fair to say that those anatomists
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.780]   were using a little bit of creative elaboration
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.220]   when thinking about what the hippocampus looks like.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.360]   Nonetheless, it is a curved structure.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.200]   It has many layers.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.700]   It's been described by my colleague, Robert Sapolsky,
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.620]   and by others as looking more like a jelly roll
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.740]   or a cinnamon roll is what it looks like to me.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.020]   And if you were to take one cinnamon roll,
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.700]   chop it down the middle.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.020]   So now you've got two half cinnamon rolls
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.920]   and rather than put them back together
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.520]   in the configuration they were before,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.100]   you just slide one down so that you've got essentially
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.380]   two C's, two C-shaped halves of the cinnamon roll
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.420]   and you push them together,
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.180]   slightly offset from one another.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.340]   Well, that's what the hippocampus looks like to me.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.540]   And I think that's a far better description
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.300]   of its actual physical structure.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.560]   But I guess if you were to use that physical structure
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.780]   as the name, well, then you'd have to open up
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.700]   a brain atlas and it would be called
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.100]   two half C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.940]   So that's not very good.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.620]   So I guess seahorse will work.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.140]   Hippocampus is the name of this structure
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.180]   and it is the site in your brain.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.140]   And again, you have one on each side of your brain
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.460]   in which explicit declarative memories are formed.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.220]   It is not where those memories are stored and maintained.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.980]   It is where they are established in the first place.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.120]   In contrast, implicit memories, right?
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.540]   These subconscious memories are formed and stored
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.180]   elsewhere in the brain, mainly by areas like the cerebellum,
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.300]   but also the neocortex,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.180]   the kind of outer shell of your brain.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.180]   The cerebellum is, it literally means mini brain.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.300]   And it does in fact look like a mini brain
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.660]   and is in the back of the brain.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.920]   And the neocortex is the outer part of the brain
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.900]   that covers all the other stuff.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.420]   So the hippocampus is vitally important
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.180]   for establishing these new declarative memories
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.260]   of what you know and what you know how to do.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.060]   Now, in order to really understand
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.660]   the role of the hippocampus in memory,
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.220]   in particular explicit declarative
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.020]   and explicit procedural memory,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.340]   and to really understand how that's distinct
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.340]   from implicit declarative and implicit procedural memories,
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.820]   we have to look to a clinical case.
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.300]   And the clinical case that I'm referring to
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.140]   is a patient who went by the name HM.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.800]   Patients go by their initials
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.500]   in order to maintain confidentiality of their real identity.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   HM had what's called intractable epilepsy.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.780]   So he would have these really dramatic
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.120]   so-called grand mal seizures or drop seizures.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.540]   For those of you that know somebody with epilepsy
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.680]   or that have epilepsy, you might be familiar with this.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.100]   You can have petit mal seizures, which are minor seizures.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.540]   You can have tonic-clonic seizures,
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.320]   which are sometimes not even detectable.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.820]   You can have absent seizures where people will just stop.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.020]   It's almost as if their brain goes on pause
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.860]   and they'll just stop there.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.120]   It was reported actually that Einstein had absent seizures,
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.960]   although I don't know that
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.900]   that's ever really been confirmed neurologically.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.800]   Grand mal seizures are extremely severe,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.180]   and that's what HM had.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.140]   So he could just be going about his day
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.500]   and maybe even cooking or doing something,
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.740]   driving, operating any kind of machinery,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.500]   and then all of a sudden he would just have a drop seizure
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.940]   so he would just physically drop
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.360]   and go into a grand mal seizure.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.180]   So convulsing of the whole body,
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.280]   loss of consciousness, et cetera.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.320]   Or he would feel it coming on.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.660]   Oftentimes people with epilepsy
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.700]   can feel the epilepsy seizure coming on
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.260]   kind of like a wave from the back of the brain.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.340]   And sometimes they can get to a safe circumstance,
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.180]   but not always.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.240]   And so the frequency and the intensity of his seizures
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.840]   were so robust that the neurosurgeons and neurologists
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.380]   decided that they needed to locate the origin,
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.580]   what they call the foci of those seizures
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.460]   and remove that brain tissue.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.040]   Because the way seizures work is they spread out
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.500]   from that focus or that foci of brain tissue.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.980]   And unfortunately for HM,
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.220]   the focus of his seizures was the hippocampus.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.480]   So after a lot of deliberation, a neurosurgeon,
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.580]   in fact, one of the most famous neurosurgeons
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.920]   in the world at that time
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.860]   made what are called electrolytic lesions,
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.180]   actually burned out the hippocampus in the brain of HM.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.840]   And as a consequence, he lost all explicit memory.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.480]   Now, the consequence of this was that he couldn't exist
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.080]   in normal, everyday life, like most people.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.840]   So he had to live mostly, not entirely,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.940]   but mostly in a kind of hospital setting.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.980]   And I've talked to several people who have,
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.900]   I should say, who met HM directly
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.940]   because he's no longer alive,
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.140]   but an interaction with him might look like the following.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.880]   He would walk up to you just fine.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.220]   You wouldn't know that he had any kind of brain damage.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.420]   He could walk fine.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   He could speak fine.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.340]   And he'd say, "Hi, I'm Andrew."
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.940]   And he'd say, "Hi, I'm," whatever his name happened to be.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.720]   He wouldn't say HM, but he'd probably say his real name.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.200]   And then perhaps someone new would walk into the room.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.860]   He might turn around, look at that person,
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.140]   as any of us might do, then turn around back to me
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.360]   and say, "Hi, what's your name?"
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.500]   And if I were to say, "Well, I just told you my name
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.140]   and you just told me your name.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.980]   Do you remember that?"
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.780]   He'd say, "I'm sorry, I don't remember any of that.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.620]   What's your name?"
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.200]   So you had to go through this over and over again.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.820]   So a complete lack of explicit declarative memory.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.820]   Now he did have some memory for previous events in his life
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.180]   that dated way back, okay?
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.360]   Again, hinting at the idea that memories
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.420]   are not necessarily stored in the hippocampus.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.900]   They're just formed in the hippocampus.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.460]   So once they've moved out of the hippocampus
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.260]   to other brain areas, he could still keep those memories.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.960]   They're in a different database, if you will.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.420]   They're in a different pattern of firing
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.280]   of other neural circuits, but he couldn't form new memories.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.220]   Now there's some very important and interesting twists
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.420]   on what HM could and could not do
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.180]   in terms of learning and memory
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.800]   that teach us a lot about the brain.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.100]   In fact, I think most neuroscientists would agree
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.140]   that this unfortunate case of HM's epilepsy
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.600]   and the subsequent neurosurgery that he had
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.300]   taught us much of what we know, or at least think about,
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.660]   in terms of human learning and memory.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.580]   For instance, as I mentioned before,
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.920]   he still had implicit knowledge.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.800]   He knew how to walk.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.820]   He knew how to do certain things like make a cup of coffee.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.380]   He knew the names of people that he had met
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.900]   much earlier in his life and so on.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.060]   And yet he couldn't form new memories.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.380]   Now in violation to that last statement,
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.920]   there were some elements of HM's emotionality
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.500]   that suggests that there was some sort of residual capacity
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.060]   to learn new information,
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.500]   but it wasn't what we normally think of
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.080]   as explicit declarative or procedural memory.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.980]   For instance, it's been reported, or it's been said,
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.000]   I should say, because I don't know that the studies
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.860]   were ever done with intense physiological measurements,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.820]   that if you were to tell HM a joke
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.180]   and he thought it was funny, he would laugh really hard.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.760]   Though he liked jokes, so you'd tell him, you'd say,
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   "HM, I want to tell you a joke."
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.940]   You'd tell him a joke and he'd laugh really hard.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.980]   Then you could leave the room, come back,
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.980]   and tell him the same joke again.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.700]   Now, keep in mind, he did not remember
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.980]   that you told him the joke previously.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.580]   And the second time he would laugh a little bit less.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.220]   And then you'd leave the room, come back again,
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.700]   say, "Hi, I'm Andrew."
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.620]   And he'd say, "Oh, nice to meet you."
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.040]   Because as you recall, because you can recall things,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.500]   but he couldn't recall things.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.820]   He didn't know that he just met you,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.240]   or at least he couldn't remember it.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.340]   You tell him the joke a third time or a fourth time.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.620]   And with each subsequent telling of the joke,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.920]   he found it a little less funny, just as,
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.360]   keep this in mind, folks.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.180]   If you tell a joke and you get a big laugh,
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.060]   don't tell it again, at least not immediately,
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.360]   not to the same person or the same crowd,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.600]   because the second time it's a little less funny,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.980]   and the third time it's a little less funny.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.180]   And that actually has to do with a whole element of dopamine
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.360]   and its relationship to surprise.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.260]   And that's the topic of a future podcast
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.420]   where we talk all about humor and novelty in the brain.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.140]   But the point being that certain forms of memory
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.000]   seem to exist in a kind of phantom-like way
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.400]   within HM's brain.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.300]   What do I mean by that?
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.880]   Well, this underscores the fact that he had
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.620]   an implicit memory of having heard the joke before.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.720]   And it suggests that humor, or at least what we find funny,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.300]   is somehow more related to procedures,
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.540]   similar to walking or motor ability,
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.940]   than it is to the precise content of that joke.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.480]   That's a little bit of an abstract concept,
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.320]   but the point is that HM lacked explicit declarative memory.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.020]   He couldn't tell you what he had just heard.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.120]   He could not learn new information.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.600]   And he couldn't tell you how to do something
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.940]   unless he had learned how to do that something
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.880]   many years prior.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.620]   Now, there've been a lot of other patients besides HM
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.200]   that have had brain lesions due to epilepsy,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.980]   or I should say, due to surgeries to treat epilepsy,
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.540]   due to strokes, due to sadly gunshot wounds
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   and other forms of what we call infarct,
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.540]   infarct, I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct is the word we use
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.180]   to describe damage to a particular brain region.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.240]   And many different patients with many different patterns
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.960]   of infarct have taught us a lot about how memory
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.700]   and other aspects of the brain work.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:21.280]   HM really teaches us that what we know
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.740]   and what we are able to do is the consequence of things
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.200]   that we are aware of and learnings that have been passed off
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.000]   into subconscious knowledge, that our body knows,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.920]   our brain knows, but we don't know exactly
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.560]   how we know that thing.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.980]   And I tell you the story about HM's ability
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.800]   to understand a joke,
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.340]   but that with repeated telling of a joke,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.460]   it has less and less and less of an impact
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.460]   in creating a sense of laughter, of humor in HM,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.280]   not as just an anecdote to flesh out his story,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.240]   but because emotion itself turns out to be the way
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.620]   in which we can enhance memories,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.760]   even if those are memories for things that are not funny,
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.120]   are not intensely sad, are not immensely happy,
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.160]   or don't evoke a really strong emotional response
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.980]   or even any emotional response.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.760]   And the reason for that is that emotions,
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.620]   just like perception, just like sensation,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.080]   are the consequence of particular neurochemicals
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.720]   being present in our brain and body.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.780]   And as I'm going to tell you next,
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.920]   there are particular neurochemicals
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.600]   that you can leverage in order
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.280]   to learn specific information faster
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.160]   and to remember it for a much longer period of time,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.520]   maybe even forever.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.880]   And you can do that by leveraging the relationship
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.500]   in your nervous system between your brain and your body
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.240]   and your body back to your brain.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.840]   So let's talk about tools for enhancing memory.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.360]   Now there's one tool that is absolutely clear works,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.860]   and it's always worked, it works now,
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.240]   and it will work forever.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.480]   And that's repetition.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   The more often that you perform something
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.340]   or that you recite something,
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.680]   the more likely you are to remember it in the future.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.380]   And while that might seem obvious,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.580]   it's worth thinking about what's happening
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.000]   when you repeat something.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.840]   But when I say what's happening, I mean at the neural level.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.660]   What's happening is that you're encouraging the firing
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.880]   of particular chains of neurons
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.180]   that reside in a particular circuit, right?
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.960]   So a particular sequence of neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.120]   played in that particular sequence
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.920]   over and over and over again.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.440]   And with more repetitions,
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.300]   you get more strengthening of those nerve connections.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.680]   Now, repetition works, but the problem for most people
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.020]   is that they either don't have the patience,
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.880]   they don't have the time,
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.400]   and sometimes they literally don't have the time
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.120]   because they've got a deadline
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.220]   on something that they're trying to remember and learn,
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.380]   or they simply would like to be able
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.780]   to remember things better in general,
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.820]   remember them more quickly.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.640]   This process of accelerating repetition-based learning
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.680]   so that your learning curve doesn't go
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.580]   from having to perform something 1,000 times
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.320]   and then gradually over time, it's 1,750 times a day,
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.560]   500 times a day, 300 times a day,
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.400]   and down to no repetitions, right?
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   You can just perform that thing
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.800]   the first time and every time.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.820]   Well, there is a way to shift that curve
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.920]   so that you can essentially establish stronger connections
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.840]   between the neurons that are involved
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.800]   in generating that memory or behavior more quickly.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.660]   How do you do that?
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.220]   Well, in order to answer that,
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.760]   we have to look at the beautiful work
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.680]   of James McGaugh and Larry Cahill.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.260]   James McGaugh and Larry Cahill did a number of experiments
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.240]   over several decades, really,
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.460]   based on a lot of animal literature,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.140]   but mainly focused on humans
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.960]   that really established what's required
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.600]   to get better at remembering things
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.620]   and to do so very quickly.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.860]   I want to talk about one experiment that they did
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.980]   that was particularly important,
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.540]   and we will provide a link to this paper.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.700]   It's some years old now, but the results still hold up.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.420]   In fact, the results establish an entire field
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.000]   of memory in neuroscience and psychology.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.900]   What they did is they had human subjects
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.060]   come into the laboratory and to read a short paragraph
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.440]   of about 12 sentences,
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.620]   and the key thing is that some subjects read a paragraph
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.900]   that was pretty mundane.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.460]   The content, the information within the paragraph
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.340]   was all related to the content of the previous sentence,
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.980]   so it was a cogent paragraph, right?
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   It just wasn't meaningless scramble of words,
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:35.140]   but it described a kind of mundane set of circumstances.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.740]   Maybe it would be a story about someone
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.520]   who walked into a room, sat down at a desk,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   wrote for a little bit, then got up and had lunch,
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.700]   just kind of mundane information, not very interesting.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.620]   Another group of subjects read also
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.940]   a 12-sentence paragraph, but that paragraph
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.600]   included a subset of sentences
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.040]   that had a lot of emotionally intense language,
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.520]   or that had language that could evoke
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.320]   an emotionally intense response in the person reading it.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.420]   So it might've talked about a car accident
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.600]   or a very intense surgery,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.740]   but it also could be positive stuff,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.240]   things like a birthday party
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.560]   or a celebration of some other kind or a big sports win.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.420]   So in other words, you have two conditions of this study,
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.700]   people either read a boring paragraph
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.500]   or they read a really emotionally laden paragraph.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.700]   And again, the emotions could either be positive
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.900]   or negative emotions.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.300]   Subjects left the laboratory and sometime later,
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.040]   they were called back to the laboratory.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.700]   And I should say at no point in the experiment
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.040]   did they know they were part of a memory experiment, okay?
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.020]   They don't know why they're reading this paragraph.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.700]   They came in either for class credit or to get paid.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.900]   It's typically how these things are done
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.180]   on college campuses or elsewhere.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.860]   They come back into the lab
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.620]   and they would get a pop quiz.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.520]   They would be asked to recall the content of the paragraph
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.700]   that they had read previously.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.880]   As is probably expected, perhaps even obvious to you,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.700]   the subjects that read the emotionally intense paragraph
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.500]   remembered far more of the content of that paragraph
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.900]   and were far more accurate
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.660]   in their remembering of that information.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.460]   Now, that particular finding wasn't very novel.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.380]   Many people had previously described
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.540]   how emotionally intense events are better remembered
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.780]   than non-emotionally intense events.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.600]   In fact, way back in the 1600s, Francis Bacon,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.320]   who's largely credited with developing the scientific method
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.040]   said, quote, "Memory is assisted by anything
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.200]   "that makes an impression on a powerful passion,
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.400]   "inspiring fear, for example, or wonder, shame, or joy."
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.860]   Francis Bacon said that in 1620.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.700]   So Jim McGaugh and Larry Cahill
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.180]   were certainly not the first to demonstrate
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.700]   or to conceive of the idea
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.060]   that emotionally laden experiences
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.460]   are more easily remembered than other experiences.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.800]   However, what they did next was immensely important
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.300]   for our understanding of memory
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.900]   and for our building of tools
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.400]   to enhance learning and memory.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.220]   What they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.460]   and for particular neurochemicals associated with stress
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.380]   to improve our ability to learn information,
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.620]   not just information that is emotional,
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.940]   but information of all kinds.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.380]   So I'm going to describe some experiments
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.420]   done in animal models just very briefly,
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.620]   and then experiments done on human subjects,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.900]   because McGaugh worked mainly on animals,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.080]   also human subjects,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.960]   Larry Cahill almost exclusively on human subjects.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:38.480]   If you take a rat or a mouse and put it in an arena
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.440]   where at one location the animal receives an electrical shock
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.600]   and then you come back the next day,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.280]   you remove the shock evoking device
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.480]   and you let the animal move around that arena,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.600]   that animal will quite understandably avoid the location
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.300]   where it was shocked, so-called conditioned place aversion.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.640]   That effect of avoiding that particular location
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.780]   occurs in one trial.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.920]   That's a good example of one trial learning.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.960]   So somehow the animal knows
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.160]   that it was shocked at that location.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.260]   It remembers that it is a hippocampal dependent learning.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.160]   So animals that lack a hippocampus
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.240]   or who have their hippocampus pharmacologically
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.600]   or otherwise incapacitated
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.880]   will not learn that new bit of information.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.060]   But for animals that do,
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.680]   they remember it after the first time and every time,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.080]   unless you are to block the release of certain chemicals
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:32.960]   in the brain and body.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.280]   And the chemicals I'm referring to are epinephrine,
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.080]   adrenaline, and to some extent the corticosterones,
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.720]   things like cortisol.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.360]   Now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.320]   somehow involves epinephrine,
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.160]   at least in this particular experimental scenario,
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.880]   because if researchers do the exact same experiment
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.860]   and they have done the exact same experiment,
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.400]   but they introduce a pharmacological blocker of epinephrine
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.440]   so that epinephrine is released in response to the shock,
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.200]   but it cannot actually bind to its receptors
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.360]   and have all of its biological effects.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.400]   Well, then the animal is perfectly happy to tread back
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.680]   into the area where it received the shock.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.280]   It's almost as if it didn't know,
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.140]   or we have to assume that didn't remember
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.680]   that it received the shock at that location.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.380]   So it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it,
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.640]   something bad happens in a location,
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.140]   you don't go back to that location.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.380]   So that's conditioned place avoidance,
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.160]   but it turns out that the opposite is also true,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.400]   meaning for something called conditioned place preference,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.760]   you can take an animal, put it into an arena,
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   feed it or reward it somehow at one location in that arena.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.040]   So you can give a hungry rat or mouse food
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.280]   at one particular location, take the animal out,
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.580]   come back the next day, no food is introduced,
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.160]   but it'll go back to the location where it received the food
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.680]   or you can do any variant of this.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.240]   You can make the arena a little bit chilly
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.260]   and provide warmth at that location,
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:59.040]   or you can take a male animal and turns out male rats
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.360]   and mice will mate at any point or a female animal
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.200]   that's at the particular so-called receptive phase
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.320]   of her mating cycle and give them an opportunity
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.520]   to mate at a given location,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.180]   they'll go back to that location and wait and wait.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.520]   This is perhaps why people go back to the same bar,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.560]   the bar, seat at the bar or the same restaurant
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.880]   and wait because of the one time they, you know,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.240]   things worked out for them, whatever the context was.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.880]   Conditioned place preference.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.960]   Conditioned place preference,
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.200]   as with conditioned place avoidance,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.240]   depends on the release of adrenaline, right?
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.200]   It's not just about stress,
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.480]   it's about a heightened emotional state in the brain
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.460]   and body, okay, this is really important.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.240]   It's not just about stress.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.520]   You can get one trial learning for positive events,
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.920]   conditioned place preference,
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.560]   and you can get one trial learning for negative events.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.280]   Here I say positive, negative,
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.720]   I'm putting what's called valence on,
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.880]   I'm making a value judgment about whether or not
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.340]   the animal liked it or didn't like it,
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:55.200]   and we have to presume what the animal liked or didn't like
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.040]   and how it felt,
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.840]   but this turns out all to be true for humans as well.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.420]   We know that because McGaugh and Cahill did experiments
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.000]   where they gave people a boring paragraph to read
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.360]   and only a boring paragraph to read,
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.320]   but one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.600]   and then to place their arm into very, very cold water.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.160]   In fact, it was ice water.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.520]   We know that placing one's arm into ice water,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.080]   especially if it's up to the shoulder or near to it,
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.480]   evokes the release of adrenaline in the body.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.780]   It's not an enormous release,
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.360]   but it's a significant increase.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.920]   And yes, they measured adrenaline release.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.760]   In some cases,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.440]   they also measured for things like cortisol, et cetera.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.980]   And what they found is that if one evokes the release
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.760]   of adrenaline through this arm into ice water approach,
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.880]   the information that they read previously,
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.120]   just a few minutes before, was remembered.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.400]   It was retained as well as emotionally intense information,
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.060]   but keep in mind that information that they read
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.120]   was not interesting at all,
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.980]   or at least it wasn't emotionally laden.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.800]   This had to be the effect of adrenaline released
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.180]   into the brain and body,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:09.840]   because if they blocked the release or the function
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.260]   of adrenaline in the brain and or body,
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.620]   they could block this effect.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.840]   Now, the biology of epinephrine and cortisol
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.900]   are a little bit complex,
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.080]   but there's some nuance there that's actually interesting
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.020]   and important to us.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.300]   First of all, adrenaline is released in the body
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.140]   and in the brain.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.060]   It's released in the body from the adrenals,
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.040]   remember epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.100]   Cortisol is also released from the adrenal glands,
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.600]   these two little glands that ride atop our kidneys,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.460]   but it can't cross into the brain.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.280]   It only has what we call peripheral effects,
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.080]   quickening of the heart rate, right?
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.640]   Changes the patterns of blood flow,
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.040]   changes our patterns of breathing,
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.800]   in general makes our breathing more shallow and faster,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.360]   in general makes our heartbeat more quickly, et cetera.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.240]   Within our brain, we have a little brain area
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.620]   called locus coeruleus, which is in the back of the brain,
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.600]   which has the opportunity to sprinkler the rest of the brain
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.360]   with the neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.240]   as well as norepinephrine, a related neuromodulator,
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.520]   and to essentially wake up or create a state of alertness
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.600]   throughout the brain, so it's a very general effect.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.840]   The reason we have two sites of release
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.760]   is because these neurochemicals
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.900]   do not cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.520]   and so waking up the body with adrenaline
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.360]   and waking up the brain are two separate
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.500]   so-called parallel phenomena.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.200]   Cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.600]   because it's lipophilic,
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.640]   meaning it can move through fatty tissue,
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.240]   and we'll get into the biology of that in another episode,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.280]   but cortisol in general is released
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.920]   and has much longer term effects,
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.960]   and as I've just told you,
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.760]   can permeate throughout the brain and body.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.380]   Adrenaline has more local effects,
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.220]   or at least is segregated between the brain and the body.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.280]   This will turn out to be important later.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.480]   The important thing to keep in mind
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:53.020]   is that it is the emotionality evoked by an experience,
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.020]   or to be more precise,
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.620]   it is the emotional state that you are in
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.960]   after you experience something
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.200]   that dictates whether or not
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.600]   you will learn it quickly or not.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.880]   This is absolutely important
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.520]   in terms of thinking about tools to improve your memory,
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.320]   and no, I am not going to suggest
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.620]   that every time you want to learn something,
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.200]   you plunge your arm into ice water.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.480]   Why won't I suggest that?
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.600]   Well, it will induce the release of adrenaline,
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.980]   but there are better ways to get that adrenaline release.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.460]   Before I explain exactly what those tools are,
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.560]   I want to tamp down the biology of how all this works,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.580]   because in that understanding,
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.400]   you will have access to the best possible tools
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.240]   to improve your memory.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.360]   First of all, McGaugh and Cahill
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.880]   were excellent experimentalists.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.820]   They did not just establish
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.720]   that you could quicken the formation of a memory
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.000]   by accessing material that was very emotionally laden
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.120]   or creating an emotional high adrenaline state
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.320]   after interacting with some thing,
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.160]   some word, some person, some information.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.960]   They also tested whether or not
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.900]   that whole effect could be blocked
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.160]   by blocking the emotional state or by blocking adrenaline.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.880]   So what they did is they had people read paragraphs
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.000]   that either had a lot of emotional content
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.980]   or they had people read paragraphs that were pretty boring,
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.600]   but then had them put their arm into ice water.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.320]   And I should say they did other experiments too
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.400]   to increase adrenaline.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.700]   There were even some shock experiments
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.240]   that were done by other groups,
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.180]   any number of things to evoke the release of adrenaline,
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.720]   even people taking drugs that increase adrenaline.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.020]   But then they also did what are called blocking experiments.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.340]   They did experiments where they had people
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.280]   get into a highly emotional state
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.640]   from reading highly emotional material,
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.800]   or they got people to get into
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.600]   a highly emotional neurochemical state
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.880]   by reading boring material
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.480]   and then taking a drug to increase adrenaline
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.320]   or ice bath or a shock.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.120]   And then they also administered a drug
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.840]   called a beta blocker to block the effect of adrenaline
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.960]   and related chemicals in the brain and body.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.360]   And what they found is that
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.920]   even if people were exposed to something really emotional
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.200]   or had a lot of adrenaline in their system
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.240]   because they received a drug
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.520]   to increase the amount of adrenaline,
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.640]   two manipulations that normally would increase memory,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.040]   keep that in mind,
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.480]   if they gave them a beta blocker,
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.540]   which reduced the response to that adrenaline, right?
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.840]   So no quickening of the heart rate,
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   no quickening of the breathing,
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.080]   no increase in the activity of locus coeruleus
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.700]   and these kind of wake up signals to the rest of the brain.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.000]   Well, then the material wasn't remembered better at all.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.080]   What this tells us is that yes, Francis Bacon was right.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.560]   McGaugh and Cahill were right.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.680]   Hundreds, if not thousands of philosophers
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   and psychologists and neuroscientists were right
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.380]   in stating and in thinking that high emotional states
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.060]   help you learn things.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.000]   But what McGaugh and Cahill really showed
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   and what's most important to know
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.840]   is that it is the presence of high adrenaline,
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.600]   high amounts of norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.160]   and perhaps cortisol as well, as you'll soon see,
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.920]   that allows a memory to be stamped down quickly.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.360]   It is not the emotion.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.120]   It is the neurochemical state that you go into
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.480]   as a consequence of the emotion.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.720]   And it's very important to understand
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.400]   that while those two things are related,
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.740]   they are not one and the same thing.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.040]   Because what that means is that were you to evoke
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.640]   the release of epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol,
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.100]   or even just one or two of those chemicals,
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.200]   after experiencing something,
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.120]   you are stamping down the experience
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.200]   that you just previously had.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:38.120]   This is fundamentally important and far and away different
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:41.280]   than the idea that we remember things
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.840]   because they are important to us
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.240]   or because they evoke emotion.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.620]   That's true, but the real reason, the neurochemical reason,
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.560]   the mechanism behind all that
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.480]   is these neurochemicals have the ability
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.720]   to strengthen neural connections
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.440]   by making them active just once.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.920]   There's something truly magic
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.740]   about that neurochemical cocktail
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.180]   that removes the need for repetition.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.720]   Okay, so let's apply this knowledge.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.240]   Let's establish a scientifically grounded set of tools,
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.880]   meaning tools that take into account
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.040]   the identity of the neurochemicals
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.520]   that are important for enhancing learning
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.060]   and the timing of the release of those chemicals
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.220]   in order to enhance learning.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.520]   When I first learned about the results of McGaugh and Cahill,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.660]   I was just blown away.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.360]   I was also pretty upset, but not with them.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.440]   I was upset with myself because I realized
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.000]   that the way that I'd been approaching learning and memory
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.480]   was not optimal.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.780]   In fact, it was probably in the opposite direction
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.680]   to the enhanced protocol for learning and memory
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.080]   that I'm going to teach you today.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.920]   My typical mode of trying to learn something
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.960]   while I was in college or while I was in graduate school,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.200]   or as a junior professor or even a tenured professor
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.600]   was to sit down to whatever it is
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   I was going to try and learn, perhaps even memorize,
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.040]   or if it was a physical skill,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.540]   move to whatever environment
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.520]   I was going to learn that physical skill in.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.680]   And prior to that, to make sure that I was hydrated,
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.880]   'cause that's important to me,
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.720]   and certainly can contribute to your brain's ability
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.960]   to function and your body's ability to function
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.080]   and general patterns of alertness, but also to caffeinate.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.420]   I would have a nice strong cup of coffee or espresso.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.020]   I would have a nice strong cup of yerba mate.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:27.000]   And I still drink coffee or yerba mate very regularly.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.360]   I drink them in moderation, I think, certainly for me,
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.520]   but typically I would drink those things
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.220]   before I would engage in any kind of attempt
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.240]   to learn or memorize or to acquire a new skill.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.120]   Now, caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   or any other form of caffeine
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.400]   does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.680]   And it does that through two major mechanisms.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:54.080]   The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.360]   Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.880]   the longer that we are awake.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.600]   And it's largely what's responsible
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.140]   for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.280]   when we've been awake for a very long time.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:10.240]   Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.600]   It's a competing agonist, not to get technical,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.240]   but it binds to the receptor for adenosine
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.120]   for some period of time and prevents adenosine
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.120]   from having its normal pattern of action
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.800]   and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.580]   But it also increases state of alertness.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.800]   So while it's reducing fatigue,
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.000]   it's also pushing on neurochemical systems
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.720]   in order to directly increase our alertness.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.760]   And it does that in large part by increasing
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.600]   the transmission of epinephrine,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.560]   adrenaline in the brain and body.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.040]   It also has this interesting effect
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.040]   of upregulating the number and or efficiency,
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.180]   or we say the efficacy of dopamine receptors,
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.720]   such that when dopamine is present
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.680]   and as a molecule that increases motivation
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.080]   and craving and pursuit,
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   that dopamine can have a more potent effect
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.200]   than it would otherwise.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.240]   So caffeine really hits these three systems.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.240]   It hits other systems too,
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.720]   but it mainly reduces fatigue by reducing adenosine,
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.200]   increases alertness by increasing epinephrine release
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   or adrenaline release,
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.140]   I should say both from the adrenals in your body
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.720]   and from locus coeruleus within the brain.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.920]   And it can in parallel to all that increase the action
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.160]   or the efficacy of the action of dopamine.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.780]   So my typical way of approaching learning and memory
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.760]   would be to drink some caffeine and then focus really hard
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.480]   on whatever it is that I'm trying to learn,
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.440]   trying to eliminate distractions and then hope, hope, hope,
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.800]   or try, try, try to remember that information
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.440]   as best as I could.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.680]   And frankly, I felt like it was working pretty well for me.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.420]   And typically if I leveraged other forms of pharmacology
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.100]   in order to enhance learning and memory,
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.440]   things like alpha GPC or phosphatidylserine,
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.160]   I would do that by taking those things
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.000]   before I sat down to learn a particular set of information
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.040]   or before I went off to learn a particular physical skill.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.260]   Now, for those of you out there listening to this,
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.120]   you're probably thinking, well, okay,
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.880]   the results of McGaugh and Cahill pointed to the fact
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:10.560]   that having adrenaline released after learning something
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.540]   enhanced learning of that thing.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.880]   But a lot of these things like caffeine or alpha GPC
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:20.080]   can increase epinephrine and adrenaline or dopamine
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.440]   or other molecules in the brain and body
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.700]   that can enhance memory for a long period of time.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.720]   So it makes sense to take it first or even during learning
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.020]   and then allow that increase to occur.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.040]   And the increase will occur over a long period of time
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.260]   and will enhance learning and memory.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:39.560]   And while that is partially true, it is not entirely true.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.820]   And it turns out it's not optimal.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.160]   Work that was done by the McGaugh laboratory
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.400]   and other laboratories evaluated
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.140]   the precise temporal relationship
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:54.100]   between neurochemical activation of these pathways
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.280]   and learning and memory.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.540]   What they did is they had animals and or people,
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.520]   depending on the experiment, take a drug, could be caffeine,
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.620]   could be in pill form,
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:06.700]   something that would increase adrenaline
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:10.180]   or related molecules that create this state of alertness
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.100]   that are related to emotionality.
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.420]   And they had them do it either an hour before,
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:17.380]   30 minutes before, 10 minutes before,
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:20.100]   five minutes before learning
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:23.100]   or during the bout of learning, right?
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.240]   The reading of the information
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.220]   or the performing of the skill that one is trying to learn,
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.820]   or five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.900]   30 minutes, et cetera, afterwards.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.980]   So they looked very precisely at when exactly is best
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.940]   to evoke this adrenaline release.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.260]   And it turns out that the best time window
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.660]   to evoke the release of these chemicals,
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.820]   if the goal is to enhance learning
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.660]   and memory of the material is either immediately after
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.840]   or just a few minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.920]   after you're repeating that information,
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.380]   you're trying to learn that information.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.180]   Again, this could be cognitive information
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.200]   or this could be a physical skill.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.680]   Now, this really spits in the face of the way
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.980]   that most of us approach learning and memory.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   Most of us, if we use stimulants like caffeine or alpha GPC,
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.140]   we're taking those before or during an attempt to learn,
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.460]   not afterwards.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.940]   These results point to the fact
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.800]   that it is after the learning and memory
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.140]   that you really want to get that big increase
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.460]   in epinephrine and the related molecules
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.880]   that will tamp down memory.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.540]   So what this means is that if you are currently using
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.540]   caffeine or other compounds,
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.840]   and we'll talk about what those are
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.620]   and safety issues and so forth in a moment,
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.780]   if you're using those compounds
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.420]   in order to enhance learning and memory
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:42.560]   by taking them before or during a learning episode,
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.040]   well, then I encourage you to try and take them either late
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.340]   in the learning episode
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.880]   or immediately after the learning episode.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.560]   Now, given everything I've told you up until now,
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.440]   why would I say late in the learning episode
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.560]   or immediately after?
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.160]   Well, when you ingest something by drinking it
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.680]   or you take it in capsule form,
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.520]   there's a period of time
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.040]   before that gets absorbed into the body
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.800]   and different substances such as caffeine,
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.160]   alpha GPC, et cetera,
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.040]   are absorbed in from the gut and into the bloodstream
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.100]   and reach the brain and trigger these effects
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.600]   in the brain and body at different rates.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.280]   And so it's not instantaneous.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.880]   Some have effects within minutes,
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.320]   others within tens of minutes and so on.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.600]   It's really going to depend on the pharmacology
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.440]   of those things.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.720]   And it's also going to depend on whether or not
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   you have food in your gut,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.160]   what else you happen to have circulating
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.800]   in your bloodstream, et cetera.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.240]   But at a very basic level,
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.640]   we can confidently say that there are not one, not dozens,
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.680]   but as I mentioned before,
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.880]   hundreds of studies in animals and in humans
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.740]   that point to the fact that triggering the increase
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.960]   of adrenaline late in learning
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.640]   or immediately after learning is going to be most beneficial
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.760]   if your goal is to retain that information
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.920]   for some period of time
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.140]   and to reduce the number of repetitions required
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.920]   in order to learn that information.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.340]   Now, I want to acknowledge that on previous episodes
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.120]   of this podcast and in appearing on other podcasts,
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.920]   I've talked a lot about things like non-sleep deep rest
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.960]   and naps and sleep as vital to the learning process.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960]   And I want to emphasize
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.420]   that none of that information has changed, right?
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.320]   I don't look at any of that information differently
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.760]   as the consequence of what I'm talking about today.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.680]   It is still true that the strengthening of connections
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.460]   in the brain, the literal neuroplasticity,
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.840]   the changing of the circuits occurs during deep sleep
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.680]   and non-sleep deep rest.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.960]   And it is also true,
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.840]   and I've mentioned these results earlier,
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.720]   that two papers were published in Cell Reports,
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.480]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.840]   over the last few years showing that brief naps
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.800]   of about 20 to up to 90 minutes in some period of time
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.720]   after an attempt to learn can enhance the rate of learning
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.360]   and memory.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.720]   However, those bouts of sleep,
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.320]   the deep sleep that night, I should say,
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.680]   or those brief naps, or even the so-called NSDR,
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.200]   as we call it, non-sleep deep rest that was used
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.800]   to enhance the learning and memory
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.360]   of particular pieces of information,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.960]   either cognitive or physical information or both,
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.420]   that still can be performed,
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:08.420]   but it can be performed some hours later, even an hour later
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.020]   it can be performed two hours later or four hours later.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.360]   Remember, it's in these naps and in deep sleep
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.700]   that the actual reconfiguration of the neural circuits
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.940]   occurs, the strengthening of those neural circuits occurs.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.440]   It is not the case that you need to finish a bout
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.520]   of learning and drop immediately into a nap or sleep.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.800]   Some people might do that,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.300]   but if you're really trying to optimize and enhance
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:31.080]   and improve your memory, the data from McGaugh and Cahill
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.660]   and many other laboratories that stemmed out
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.120]   from their initial work really point to the fact
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.040]   that the ideal protocol would be focus on the thing
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.600]   you're trying to learn very intensely.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.220]   There are also some other things like error rates, et cetera.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.780]   Please see our episodes on learning.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:48.320]   We have a newsletter on how to learn better.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.000]   You can access that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.720]   It's a zero cost newsletter.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.240]   You can grab that PDF.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.800]   It lists out the things to do during the learning bout.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.280]   Still try and get excellent sleep.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.120]   Again, fundamentally important for mental health,
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.580]   physical health, and performance.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.300]   And we can now extend from performance to saying,
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.540]   including learning and memory, nap,
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.880]   if it doesn't interrupt your nighttime sleep,
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.380]   naps of anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.980]   or non-sleep-depress protocols
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.400]   will enhance learning and memory.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.720]   But we can now add to that that spiking adrenaline,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.800]   provided it can be done in a safe way,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.280]   is going to reduce the number of repetitions
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.120]   required to learn.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.520]   And that should be done at the very tail end
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.720]   or immediately after a learning bout,
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.360]   which is compatible with all the other protocols
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.200]   that I mentioned.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.200]   And the reason I'm revisiting the stuff about sleep
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.540]   and non-sleep-depress
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.040]   is I think that some people got the impression
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.080]   that they need to do that immediately after learning.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.640]   And today I'm saying to the contrary,
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.780]   immediately after learning,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.540]   you need to go into a heightened state of emotionality
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.400]   and alertness.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.840]   Now it's vitally important to point out
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.560]   that you do not need pharmacology.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.460]   You don't need caffeine.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.680]   You don't need alpha GPC.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.820]   You don't need any pharmacologic substance
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.620]   to spike adrenaline,
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.300]   unless that's something that you already are doing
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.000]   or that you can do safely
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.680]   or that you know that you can do safely.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.160]   And I always say, and I'll say it again,
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.120]   I'm not a physician, so I'm not prescribing anything.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.200]   I'm a professor, so I profess things.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.800]   You need to do what's safe for you.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.140]   So if you're somebody who's not used to drinking caffeine
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.040]   and you suddenly drink four espresso
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.580]   after trying to learn something,
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:25.580]   you are going to have a severe increase in alertness
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.760]   and probably even anxiety.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.260]   If you're panic attack prone,
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.240]   please don't start taking stimulants
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.720]   in order to learn things better.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.560]   Please be safe.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.580]   I don't just say that to protect me.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.020]   I say that to protect you.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.280]   And I should mention that if you're not accustomed
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.520]   to taking something,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.200]   you always want to first check with your doctor, of course,
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.040]   but also move into that gradually, right?
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.700]   Start with the lowest effective dose,
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.240]   the minimal effective dose.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.240]   And sometimes the minimal effective dose is zero milligrams.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.400]   It's nothing.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.240]   Why do I say that?
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.480]   Well, we already talked about results
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.260]   where they put people's arms into an ice bath
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.880]   in order to evoke adrenaline release.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.320]   You are welcome to do that if you want.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.640]   In fact, that's a pretty low cost, zero pharmacology,
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.280]   at least exogenous pharmacology way
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.040]   to approach this whole thing.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.960]   That's a way of evoking your own natural epinephrine.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.480]   And it turns out also dopamine release.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.200]   You could take a cold shower.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.880]   You could do an ice bath or get into a cold circulating bath.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.920]   We've done several episodes on the utility of cold
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.800]   for health and performance.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.080]   You can find those episodes at huberunelab.com.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.800]   Also the episode with my colleague at Stanford
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.060]   from the biology department, Dr. Craig Heller,
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.780]   lots of protocols in particular,
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.700]   in the episode on cold for health and performance
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:41.980]   that describe how best to use the cold shower
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.620]   or the ice bath or the circulating cold bath
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.320]   in order to evoke epinephrine and dopamine release.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.980]   The point is that the time in which you would want
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.100]   to do those protocols is after,
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.280]   ideally immediately after you're learning about,
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.500]   meaning when you're sitting down to learn new information
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.280]   or after trying to learn some new physical skill.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.460]   Now, whether or not that's compatible
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.880]   with the other reasons you're doing deliberate cold exposure
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.280]   and whether or not that's compatible
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.320]   with the other things you're doing,
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.080]   that depends on the contour of your lifestyle,
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.440]   your training, your academic goals,
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.840]   your learning goals, et cetera.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.880]   But if your specific purpose is to enhance learning
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.920]   and memory, you want to spike adrenaline afterwards.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.680]   And so what I'm telling you is you can do that with caffeine.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.780]   You can do that with alpha GPC.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.640]   You can do that with a combination of caffeine and alpha GPC
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.360]   if you can do that safely.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.780]   Some of you I know are using other forms of pharmacology.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.260]   I did a long episode all about ADHD.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.660]   I have to just really declare my stance very clearly
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.780]   that I am not a fan.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.220]   I am actually opposed to people using prescription drugs
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.480]   who are not prescribed those drugs, right?
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.960]   In order to enhance alertness,
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.720]   I think there's a big addictive potential.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.140]   There also is a potential to really disrupt
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.820]   one's own pharmacology around the dopaminergic system.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.000]   However, some of you I know are prescribed things
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.960]   like Ritalin, Adderall, and modafinil and things of that sort
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   in order to increase alertness and focus.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.820]   So for those of you that are prescribed those things
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.680]   from a board certified physician,
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.240]   you're going to have to decide if you're going to take them
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.040]   before trying to learn or after trying to learn.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.380]   You also have to take into consideration
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.440]   that some of those drugs are very long acting,
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.960]   some are shorter acting and time that
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.200]   according to what you're trying to learn and when.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.800]   So that's pharmacology.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.800]   But as I've mentioned, there are the behavioral protocols.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   You can use cold and cold is an excellent stimulus
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.880]   because first of all, it doesn't involve pharmacology.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.680]   Second of all, you can generally access it
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.360]   at low to zero cost, especially the cold shower approach.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.960]   And third, you can titrate it.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.680]   You can start with warmer water.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.980]   You can make it very, very cold if that's your thing
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.480]   and you're able to tolerate that safely.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.780]   You can make it moderately cold.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.560]   How cold should it be in order to evoke adrenaline release?
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.520]   Well, it should be uncomfortably cold,
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.960]   but cold enough that you feel like you really want to get out
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.340]   but can stay in safely.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.560]   That's going to evoke adrenaline release.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.120]   If it quickens your breathing,
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.040]   if it makes you go wide-eyed,
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.520]   that's increasing adrenaline release.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.800]   In fact, those effects of going wide-eyed
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800]   and quickening of the breathing
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.720]   and the challenges and thinking clearly,
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.360]   those are the direct effects of adrenaline
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.840]   on your brain and body.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.160]   And of course, there are other ways to increase adrenaline.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.720]   You could go out for a hard run.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.820]   You could do any number of things
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.060]   that would increase adrenaline in your body.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.440]   Which things you choose is up to you.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.400]   But from a very clear, solid grounding in research data,
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.100]   we can confidently say that spiking adrenaline
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.620]   after interacting with some material,
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.840]   physical or cognitive material that you're trying to learn
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.380]   is going to be the best time to spike that adrenaline.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.240]   Now, I realize that I'm being a bit redundant today
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.700]   or perhaps a lot redundant in repeating over and over
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.380]   that the increase in epinephrine should occur
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.280]   either very late in an attempt to learn something
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:58.180]   or immediately after an attempt to learn something.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.940]   I also want to emphasize the general contour
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.640]   of pharmacologic effects and of behavioral tools
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.880]   to create adrenaline.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.260]   What do I mean by that sentence?
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.240]   What I mean is that McGaugh and colleagues
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.720]   explored a huge number of different compounds and approaches,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.760]   everything from the hand into the ice bath
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.400]   to injecting adrenaline, to caffeine,
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.320]   to drugs that block the effects of adrenaline and caffeine,
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.160]   drugs like mucimol and picrotoxin, please don't take those.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.560]   These are drugs that reduce or enhance
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.560]   the amount of adrenaline.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.640]   And the overall takeaway is that anything
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:35.280]   that increases adrenaline will increase learning and memory
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.880]   and will reduce the number of repetitions
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.160]   required to learn something,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.880]   regardless of whether or not that something
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.800]   has an emotional intensity or not.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.740]   Provided that that spike in adrenaline occurs
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.580]   late in the learning or immediately after,
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.720]   and anything that reduces epinephrine and adrenaline
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.760]   will impair learning.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.560]   And that's the key and novel piece of information
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.960]   that I'm adding now, which is if you're taking beta blockers,
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.560]   for instance, or if you're trying to learn something
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.960]   and it's not evoking much of an emotional response
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.640]   and you're not using any pharmacology or other methods
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.780]   to enhance adrenaline release after learning that thing,
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:17.100]   well, you're not going to learn it very well.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.560]   In fact, McGaugh and Cahill did beautiful experiments
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.980]   in humans looking at how much adrenaline is increased
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:29.280]   by varying the emotional intensity of different things
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.160]   that they were trying to get people to learn
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   or by changing the dosage of epinephrine
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.480]   or by changing the amount of epinephrine blocker
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.420]   that they injected, lots and lots of studies.
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.160]   The key thing to take away from those studies
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.680]   is that for some people,
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.280]   adrenaline was increased 600 to 700%.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.900]   So six to seven fold over baseline
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.700]   in the amount of circulating epinephrine or adrenaline.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.400]   And keep in mind, sometimes that increase
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.500]   was due to the actual thing they were trying to learn
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.600]   being very emotional, positive or negative emotion.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.260]   And sometimes it was because they were using
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.900]   a pharmacologic approach or the ice bath approach.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.560]   I don't think they ever used a cold shower approach,
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.200]   but that would have been a very effective one,
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.380]   we can be sure.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.380]   However, other people had a zero to 10% increase
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.140]   or a very small increase in epinephrine.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:19.200]   What we can confidently say on the basis of all those data
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.660]   is that the more epinephrine release,
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.820]   the better that people remembered the material.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.200]   Over and over again, this was shown
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.100]   whether or not it was for cognitive materials,
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.760]   so learning a language, learning a passage of words,
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.120]   learning mathematics,
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.780]   or whether or not it was for physical learning.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.700]   I want to emphasize something about physical learning
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.100]   because I know a number of you
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.100]   are probably drinking a cup of coffee
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.620]   or having a cup of yerba mate
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:43.900]   or maybe even an energy drink
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.620]   and taking some alpha GPC or something
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:48.300]   before physical exercise.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.820]   I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.020]   or that you wouldn't want to do that,
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.360]   but that's really to increase alertness.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.800]   It won't enhance learning, at least not as well
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.060]   as doing those things after the physical exercise.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.620]   Now, again, many of you, including myself,
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.580]   exercise for sake of the physical benefits
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.500]   of that exercise, so cardiovascular resistance training,
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.860]   but we're not really focused on learning and memory.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.460]   So I emphasize this
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.420]   just so it's immensely clear to everybody.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.800]   If you want to use those approaches
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.940]   of increasing adrenaline prior to
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.820]   or during physical training
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.380]   or cognitive work for that matter, be my guest.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:26.300]   I think that's perfectly fine provided that's safe for you.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.840]   It's only by moving it to late or after the learning
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.020]   that you're really shifting the role
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.060]   of that adrenaline increase
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.540]   to enhancing memory specifically.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.340]   And as a cautionary note,
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.860]   don't think that you can push this entire system
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.740]   to the extreme over and over again,
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.420]   or chronically as we say, and get away with it.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.380]   In other words, you're not going to be able to take
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:52.180]   a alpha GPC and a double espresso,
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.120]   do your focus bout of work, cognitive or physical work,
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.780]   and then spike adrenaline again afterwards
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.580]   and remember that stuff even better, right?
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.700]   I'm not encouraging you.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:03.640]   In fact, I'm discouraging you
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.960]   from chronically increasing adrenaline
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.860]   both during and after a given bout of work
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.440]   if the goal is to learn.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.380]   Why do I say that?
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:17.600]   Well, work from McGaugh and Cahill and others
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.380]   has shown that it's not the absolute amount
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.040]   of adrenaline that you release in your brain and body
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.560]   that matters for enhancing memory.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.680]   It's the amount of adrenaline that you release
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.240]   relative to the amount of adrenaline
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.300]   that was in your system just prior,
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.320]   in particular in the hour or two prior.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.920]   So again, it's the delta, as we say, it's the difference.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.180]   So if you're going to chronically increase adrenaline,
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.160]   you're not going to learn as well.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.860]   The real key is to have adrenaline modestly low,
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.140]   perhaps even just as much as you need
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.000]   in order to be able to focus on something,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.860]   pay attention to it, and then spike it afterwards.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.900]   This is immensely important
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:58.220]   because while much of what we're talking about
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.980]   is actually a form of inducing a neurochemical acute stress,
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.300]   meaning a brief and rapid onset of stress,
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.460]   well, chronic stress,
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.860]   the chronic elevation of epinephrine and cortisol
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.620]   is actually detrimental to learning.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.500]   And there's an entire category of literature,
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.380]   mainly from the work of the great,
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.660]   and sadly the late Bruce McEwen
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.000]   from the Rockefeller University
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.580]   and some of his scientific offspring,
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.660]   like the great Robert Sapolsky,
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.780]   showing that chronic stress,
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.340]   chronic elevation of epinephrine
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.460]   actually inhibits learning and memory
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.380]   and also can inhibit immune system function,
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:37.700]   whereas acute, right, sharp increases in adrenaline
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.980]   and cortisol actually can enhance learning
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.920]   and indeed can enhance the immune system.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.780]   So if you really want to leverage this information,
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.580]   you might consider getting your brain and body
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.780]   into a very calm and yet alert state,
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.780]   so a high attentional state that will allow you
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.180]   to focus on what it is that you're trying to learn.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:58.320]   We know focus is vital for encoding information
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.260]   and for triggering neuroplasticity,
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.980]   but remaining calm throughout that time
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.860]   and then afterwards spiking adrenaline
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.740]   and allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:11.620]   on reducing the number of repetitions required to learn.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.700]   So if you're like me,
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.180]   you're learning about this information,
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.660]   this beautiful work of McGaugh and Cahill and others
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.740]   and thinking, wow, I should perhaps consider
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.060]   spiking my adrenaline in one form or another
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.320]   at the tail end or immediately following
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.220]   in attempt to learn something.
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.020]   And yet we are not the first to have this conversation
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:33.020]   nor were McGaugh and Cahill or any other researchers
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.260]   that I've discussed today,
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.780]   the first to start using this technique.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.120]   In fact, there is a beautiful review
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.740]   that was published just this year, May of 2022
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.460]   in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal,
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:48.980]   excellent journal called "Mechanisms of Memory Under Stress."
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.120]   And I just want to read to you the first opening paragraph
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.380]   of this review, which is, as the name suggests,
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.760]   all about memory and stress.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.660]   So here I'm reading and I quote,
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.580]   "In medieval times, communities threw young children
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.900]   in the river when they wanted them
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.860]   to remember important events.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.700]   They believed that throwing a child in the water
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.980]   after witnessing historic proceedings
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.540]   would leave a lifelong memory for the events in the child."
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.400]   Believe it or not, this is true.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.980]   This is a practice that somehow people arrived at.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.180]   I don't know if they were aware of what adrenaline was,
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:26.040]   probably not, but somehow in medieval times,
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.860]   it was understood that spiking adrenaline
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.160]   or creating a robust emotional experience
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.720]   after an experience that one hoped a child would learn
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.040]   would encourage the child's nervous system,
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.420]   and they didn't even know what a nervous system was,
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.440]   but would encourage the brain and body of that child
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.860]   to remember those particular events.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.880]   Very counterintuitive, if you ask me.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.680]   I would have thought that the kid would remember
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.120]   only being thrown into the river.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.520]   My guess is that they remembered that,
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.440]   but that the idea here anyway
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.820]   is that they also remember the things
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.140]   that preceded being thrown into the river.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.540]   So both interesting and amusing,
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.620]   and somewhat, I should say, thought stimulating, really,
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.620]   that this is a practice that has been going on
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.680]   for many hundreds of years,
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.140]   and we are not the first to start thinking
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.780]   about using cold water as an adrenaline stimulus,
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.100]   nor are we the first to start thinking
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.780]   about using cold water-induced adrenaline
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.580]   as a way to enhance learning and memory.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.320]   This has been happening since medieval times.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.180]   So up until now, I've been talking about
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.880]   a pretty broad contour of these experiments.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.960]   I've been talking about the underlying pharmacology,
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.320]   the role of epinephrine, and so forth.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.420]   I haven't really talked a lot
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.260]   about the underlying neural mechanisms,
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.320]   so I'm just going to take a minute or two
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.800]   and describe those for you because they are informative.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.540]   We all have a brain structure called the amygdala.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.560]   A lot of people think it's associated with fear,
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.820]   but it's actually associated with threat detection,
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.140]   and more generally, and I should say more specifically,
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.580]   with detecting what sorts of events in the environment
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.480]   are novel and are linked to particular emotional states,
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.060]   both positive emotional states
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.040]   and negative emotional states.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.120]   So the neurons in the amygdala are exquisitely good
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.280]   at figuring out, right, they don't have their own mind,
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.160]   but at detecting correlations between sensory events
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.620]   in the environment that trigger the release of adrenaline
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.220]   and what's going on in the brain,
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.920]   and because the amygdala is so extensively interconnected
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.280]   with other areas of the brain,
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.420]   it basically connects to everything,
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.180]   and everything connects back to it,
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:26.960]   the amygdala is in a position
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.380]   to strengthen particular connections in the brain
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.400]   very easily, provided certain conditions are met,
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.080]   and those conditions are the ones we've been talking about
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.600]   up until now, emotional saliency that results in increases
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.400]   in epinephrine and cortisol,
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.440]   or circulating epinephrine and cortisol being much higher
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.800]   than it was 10 minutes or 15 minutes before,
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.440]   and the net effect of the amygdala in this context
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.160]   is to take whatever patterns of neural activity
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.200]   preceded that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.320]   and strengthen those synapses
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.200]   that were involved in that neural activity.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.120]   So the amygdala doesn't have knowledge,
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.400]   it's not a thinking area, it's a correlation detector,
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.160]   and it's correlating neurochemical states
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.960]   of the brain and body with different patterns
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.440]   of electrical activity in the brain.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.280]   This is important because it really emphasizes the fact
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.320]   that both negative and positive emotional states
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.320]   and the different but somewhat overlapping chemical states
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.260]   that they create are the conditions, as we say,
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:30.760]   the AND gates through which memory is laid down.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.520]   AND gates will be familiar to those of you
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.120]   who have done a bit of computer programming.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.120]   An AND gate is simply a condition in which you need one thing
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.400]   and another to happen in order for a third thing to happen.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.080]   So you need epinephrine elevated
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.260]   and you need robust activity in a particular brain circuit
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.520]   if in fact that brain circuit is going to be strengthened.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.820]   It's not sufficient to have one or the other,
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.240]   you need both, hence the name AND gate.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.640]   And the amygdala is very good
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.480]   at establishing these AND gate contingencies.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.820]   It's also a very generic brain structure
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.360]   in the sense that it doesn't really care
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.240]   what sorts of sensory events are involved
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.100]   provided they correlated in time
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.140]   with that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone.
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.800]   This has a wonderful side and a kind of dark side.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:22.800]   The dark side is that PTSD and traumas of various kinds
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.060]   often involve a increase in adrenaline
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.900]   because whatever it was that caused the PTSD
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.060]   was indeed very stressful,
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.140]   caused these big increases in these chemicals,
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.000]   and because the amygdala is rather general
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:37.840]   in its functions, right?
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.600]   It's not tuned or designed in any kind of way
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.840]   to be specifically active in response
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.060]   to particular types of sensory events or perceptions.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.260]   Well, then what it means is that we can start
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.060]   to become afraid of entire city blocks
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.040]   where one bad thing happened in a particular room
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.220]   of a particular building in a city block.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.140]   We can become fearful of any place
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.520]   that contains a lot of people
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.260]   if something bad happened to us
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.440]   in a place that contained a lot of people.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.380]   The amygdala is not so much of a splitter,
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.820]   as we say in science, we talk about lumpers and splitters.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:16.380]   Lumpers are kind of generalizers, if that's even a word,
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:17.220]   and I think it is,
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.720]   someone will tell me one way or the other,
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.200]   and splitters are people that are ultra precise
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.480]   and specific and nuanced about every little detail.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.560]   The amygdala is more of a lumper than a splitter
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560]   when it comes to sensory events.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.660]   Other areas of the brain only become active
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.580]   under very, very specific conditions
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.780]   and only those conditions.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:40.740]   And similarly, epinephrine is just a molecule.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.500]   It's just a chemical that's circulating
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.560]   in our brain and body.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.120]   There's no epinephrine specifically for a cold shower
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.000]   that is distinct from the epinephrine
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.200]   associated with a bad event,
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.760]   which is distinct from the epinephrine
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.340]   associated with a really exciting event
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.340]   that makes you really alert.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:57.680]   Epinephrine is just a molecule, it's generic.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.780]   And so these systems have a lot of overlap,
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.340]   and that can explain in large part
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:05.560]   why when good things happen in particular locations
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.280]   and in the company of particular people,
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.620]   we often generalize to large categories
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.440]   of people, places, and things.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.140]   And when negative things happen in particular circumstances,
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.080]   we often generalize about people, places, and things
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.880]   associated with that negative event.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.660]   So now I'd like to talk about other tools
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:24.480]   that you can leverage that have been shown
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.000]   in quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.040]   to enhance learning and memory.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.720]   And perhaps one of the most potent of those tools
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.360]   is exercise.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.600]   There are numerous studies on this in both animal models
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.400]   and fortunately now also in humans,
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.220]   thanks to the beautiful work of people like Wendy Suzuki
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.740]   from New York University.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:47.040]   Wendy's lab has identified how exercise works
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.600]   to enhance learning and memory
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.240]   and other forms of cognition, I should mention,
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.480]   as well as things that can augment,
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.800]   can enhance the effects of exercise on learning and memory
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.840]   and other forms of cognition.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.800]   Wendy is going to be a guest on this podcast.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.000]   It's actually the episode that follows this episode
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.320]   and includes a lot of material
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.120]   that we have not covered today.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.720]   And she's an incredible scientist
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.600]   and has some incredible findings
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.540]   that I know everyone is going to find immensely useful.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:16.920]   In the meantime,
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.900]   I want to talk about some of the general effects of exercise
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.000]   on learning and memory that she's discovered
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.260]   and the other laboratories have discovered.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.140]   If you recall earlier,
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:27.880]   I mentioned that learning and memory
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.400]   almost always involves the strengthening
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.960]   of particular synapses and neural circuits in the brain
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.580]   and not so much the increase
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:39.160]   in the number of neurons in the brain.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.960]   There is one exception, however,
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.640]   and we now have both animal data and some human data
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.500]   to support the fact that cardiovascular exercise
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:51.200]   seems to increase what we call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.440]   Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.200]   The dentate gyrus is a sub-region of the hippocampus
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.800]   that's involved in learning and memory of particular kinds,
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.920]   certain types of events, in particular contextual learning,
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.860]   but some other things as well,
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.680]   sometimes involved in spatial learning.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.120]   There's a lot of debate about exactly
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.480]   what the dentate gyrus does,
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.340]   but for sake of this discussion,
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:14.580]   and I think everyone in the neuroscience community
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.620]   would agree that the dentate gyrus is important
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.000]   for memory formation and consolidation.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.260]   The dentate gyrus does seem to be one region of the brain,
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:25.540]   certainly in the rodent brain,
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.100]   but more and more it's seeming also in the human brain
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.280]   where at least some new neurons
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.180]   are added throughout the lifespan.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:36.720]   And as it turns out that cardiovascular exercise
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.180]   can increase the proliferation of new neurons
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.040]   in the structure and that those new neurons, excuse me,
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.560]   are important for the formation
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.600]   of certain types of new memories.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.960]   There are wonderful data showing
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.100]   that if you use X irradiation,
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.200]   which is a way to eliminate the formation of those new cells
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.240]   or other tools and tricks
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.160]   to eliminate the formation of those cells,
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.960]   that you block the formation
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.480]   of certain kinds of learning and memory.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.320]   What does this mean?
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.120]   Well, there are a lot of reasons
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.400]   for the statement I'm about to make
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.280]   that extend far beyond neurogenesis
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.000]   and the hippocampus learning and memory,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.700]   but it's very clear that getting anywhere from 180,
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:17.760]   I should say a minimum of 180 to 200 minutes
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.040]   of so-called zone two cardiovascular exercise.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.320]   So this is cardiovascular exercise that can be performed
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.480]   at a pretty steady state,
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.080]   which would allow you to just barely hold a conversation.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.000]   So breathing hard, but not super hard.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.320]   This isn't sprints or high intensity interval training,
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.940]   but doing that for 180 to 200 minutes per week total is,
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:39.640]   it appears the minimum threshold
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.160]   for enhancing some of the longevity effects
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.280]   associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.960]   And we believe that it is indirectly,
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.280]   I should say indirectly through enhancements
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.000]   in cardiovascular fitness,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.160]   that there are improvements
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.920]   in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.960]   What does that mean?
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.560]   The improvements in cardiovascular function
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.700]   are indirectly impacting the ability
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.160]   of the dentate gyrus to create these new neurons.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.920]   To my knowledge, there's no direct relationship
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.600]   between exercise and stimulating the production
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.000]   of new neurons in the brain.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.260]   It seems that it's the improvements in blood flow
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:18.920]   that also relate to improvements
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.460]   in things like lymphatic flow,
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.840]   the circulation of lymph fluid within the brain
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.900]   that are enhancing neurogenesis
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.840]   and that neurogenesis, it appears is important.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.060]   Now, in fairness to the landscape of neuroscience
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.040]   and my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.320]   there is a lot of debate as to whether or not
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.640]   there is much, if any, neurogenesis
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:42.100]   in the adult human brain.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.760]   But regardless, I think the data are quite clear
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.200]   that the 180 to 200 minutes minimum
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.960]   of cardiovascular exercise is going to be important
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.560]   for other health metrics.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.520]   Now, it is clear that exercise can impact learning
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.160]   and memory through other non-neurogenesis,
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.300]   non new neuron type mechanisms.
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.000]   And one of the more exciting ones
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.040]   that has been studied over the years
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.680]   is this notion of hormones from bone
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:11.000]   traveling in the bloodstream to the brain
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.400]   and enhancing the function of the hippocampus.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.520]   Now, the words hormones from bones is surprising to you.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.560]   I'm here to tell you that yes, indeed,
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.160]   your bones make hormones.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.980]   We call these endocrine effects.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:27.640]   So in biology, we hear about autocrine,
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.920]   paracrine and endocrine.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:32.740]   And those different terms refer to over what distance
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:35.620]   a given chemical has an effect on a cell.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.120]   For instance, a cell can have an effect on itself.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.600]   It can have an effect on immediately neighboring cells,
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.420]   or it can have an effect on both itself,
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.600]   immediately neighboring cells,
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.440]   and cells far, far away in the body.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.840]   And that last example of a given chemical or substance
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.220]   having an effect on the cell that produced it
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.380]   plus neighboring cells plus cells far away
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.520]   is an endocrine effect.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.360]   And a lot of hormones not all work in this fashion.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.620]   Hence, why we sometimes hear about endocrine and hormone
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.000]   is kind of synonymous terms.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.900]   Your bones make chemicals that travel in the bloodstream
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.320]   and have these endocrine effects.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.000]   So they're effectively acting as hormones.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.260]   And one such chemical is something called osteocalcin.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:19.560]   Now, these findings arrive to us through various labs,
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.860]   but one of the more important labs
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.680]   for sake of this discussion today
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.440]   is the laboratory of Eric Kandel
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440]   at Columbia Medical School.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.160]   Eric is now, I believe, in his mid to late 90s,
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.160]   still very sharp, and has studied learning and memory.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.840]   It also turns out that he is an avid swimmer.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.240]   Now, I happen to know that Eric swims
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.960]   anywhere from a half a mile to a mile a day.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.860]   And again, this is anecdotal.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.720]   I'm not referring to the published data just yet,
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.280]   but he credits that exercise as one of the ways
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.100]   in which he keeps his brain sharp
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:54.180]   and has indeed kept his brain sharp for many, many decades.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.960]   And as I mentioned before, he's well into his 90s,
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.360]   so pretty impressive.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.640]   His laboratory has studied the effects of exercise
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.760]   on hippocampal function and memory,
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.240]   and other laboratories have done that as well.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.440]   And what they found is that cardiovascular exercise,
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.200]   and perhaps other forms of exercise too,
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.740]   but mainly cardiovascular exercise,
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:15.040]   creates the release of osteocalcin
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.560]   from the bones that travels to the brain
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.880]   and to subregions of the hippocampus
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.920]   and encourages the electrical activity
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.740]   and the formation and maintenance of connections
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.540]   within the hippocampus and keeps the hippocampus
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.440]   functioning well in order to lay down new memories.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.480]   Now, osteocalcin has a lot of effects
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.320]   besides just improving the function of the hippocampus.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.360]   Osteocalcin is involved in bone growth itself.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.240]   It's involved in hormone regulation.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.920]   In fact, there's really nice evidence
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.980]   that it can regulate testosterone and estrogen production
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.480]   by the testes and ovaries,
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.880]   and a bunch of other effects in other organs of the body,
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:52.120]   because again, it's acting in this endocrine manner.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.500]   It's arriving from bone to a lot of different organs
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.400]   to have effects.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.840]   Load-bearing exercise in particular
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.640]   turns out to be important
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.620]   for inducing the release of osteocalcin.
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.800]   And when you think about this, it makes sense.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.940]   A nervous system exists for a lot of reasons,
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.240]   to sense, perceive, et cetera.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.160]   You've got taste, you've got smell, you've got hearing.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.080]   But the vast majority of brain real estate,
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.080]   especially in humans, is dedicated to two things.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.840]   One, vision.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.720]   We have an enormous amount of brain real estate
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.560]   devoted to vision, certainly compared to other senses.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.020]   And to movement,
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.540]   the ability to generate coarse movements of the body,
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.500]   the ability, excuse me, to generate fine movements
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.580]   of the body, like the digits, or to wink one eye,
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.440]   or to tilt your head in a particular way,
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.860]   or move your lips, or move your face,
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:39.060]   and do all sorts of different things
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.080]   in a very nuanced and detailed way.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.100]   So much of our brain real estate is devoted to movement,
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:49.420]   that it's been hypothesized for more than a half century,
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.120]   but especially in recent years,
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.920]   as we've learned more about the function of the brain
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.840]   at a really detailed circuit level,
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.040]   that the relationship between the brain and body
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.200]   and the maintenance,
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.360]   and perhaps even the improvement of neural circuitry
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.920]   in the brain, depends on our body movements
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.460]   and the signal from the body that our brain is still moving.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.300]   So think about that.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.900]   How would your brain know if your body was moving regularly?
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.580]   And how would it know how much it was moving?
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.940]   How would it know which limbs it was moving?
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.660]   Well, you could say, if the heart rate is increased,
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.200]   then the blood flow will be increased,
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.940]   and then the brain will know.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.600]   Ah, but how does your brain know
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.260]   that it's increased blood flow due to movement
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:29.980]   and not to, for instance, just stress, right?
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.080]   Maybe you actually can't move
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.300]   and you're very stressed about that,
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.800]   and so the increased blood flow
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.280]   is simply a consequence of increased stress.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:42.880]   The fact that osteocalcin is released from bone,
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.720]   and in particular can be released
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.900]   in response to load-bearing exercise,
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.400]   so this would be running.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.480]   Again, weightlifting hasn't been tested directly,
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.600]   but one would imagine anything that involves
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:57.380]   jumping and landing or weightlifting or body weight movements
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.320]   and things of that sort,
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.840]   that's a signal to release osteocalcin,
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.960]   and we know that signal occurs,
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:08.480]   that is directly reflective of the fact
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.200]   that the body was moving and moving in particular ways.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.600]   In fact, you could imagine that big bones, like your femur,
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.240]   are going to release more osteocalcin
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.280]   or be in a position to release more osteocalcin
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.240]   than fine movements like the movements of the digits.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.480]   And this idea that the body is constantly signaling
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.720]   to the brain about the status of the body
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.100]   and the varying needs of the brain
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:31.360]   to update its brain circuitry
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.840]   is a really attractive idea that fits entirely
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840]   with the biology of exercise,
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.520]   osteocalcin, and hippocampal function.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.440]   I do want to mention that I'm not the first
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.760]   to raise this hypothesis.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.660]   This hypothesis actually was discussed
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.060]   in a fair amount of detail by John Rady,
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:50.300]   who's a professor in Harvard Medical School.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.700]   He wrote a book called "Spark,"
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:54.240]   which was one of the early books,
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.160]   at least from an academic, about brain plasticity
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.640]   and the relationship between exercise
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.960]   and movement in plasticity.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.940]   And John, who I have the good fortune to know,
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.860]   has described to me experiments,
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.480]   or I should say observations,
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.620]   of species of ocean-dwelling animals
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.040]   that have, at least for the early part of their life,
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.160]   a very robust and complicated nervous system.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.640]   But then these particular animals
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.380]   are in the habit of plopping down onto a rock.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.720]   They find a kind of a safe, comfy space,
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.000]   and they actually stick to that rock,
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.960]   and they don't move anymore for a certain portion,
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.100]   I should say the late portion of their life.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.620]   And it is at the transition between moving a lot
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.540]   and being stationary that those animals
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:36.460]   actually digest their own brain.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.920]   They literally metabolize a good portion
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.760]   of their nervous system because they decide,
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.580]   oh, don't need this anymore, and gobble it up,
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.300]   use it for its nutritional value,
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:49.780]   and then sit there like a moron version of themselves
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:53.860]   with a limited amount of brain tissue
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.420]   because they don't need to move anymore.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.120]   Now, I certainly don't want to give the message
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.060]   that just moving, just exercise is sufficient
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:02.000]   to keep the neural architecture of your brain
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.660]   healthy, young, and able to learn.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.380]   While that might be true,
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.180]   it's also important to actually engage
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:10.220]   in attempts to learn new material,
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.600]   either physical material,
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.600]   so new types of movements and skills,
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.980]   and/or new types of cognitive information,
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:20.840]   languages, mathematics, history, current events,
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.720]   all sorts of things that involve your brain.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.780]   Nonetheless, it's clear that physical movement
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.560]   and cognitive ability
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.360]   and the potential to enhance cognitive ability
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.280]   and the ability to learn new physical skills
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.960]   are intimately connected.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.400]   And osteocalcin appears to be at least one way
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.040]   in which that brain-body relationship
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.680]   is established and maintained.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.120]   So given the information about osteocalcin and movement,
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.960]   and given the information about spiking adrenaline late
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:52.300]   or after a period of attempt to learn,
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:55.120]   you might be asking, when is the best time to exercise?
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.020]   Now, unfortunately, that has not been addressed
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.800]   in a lot of varying detail
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.720]   where every sort of variation on the theme
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.680]   has been carried out.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.400]   And yet, Wendy Suzuki's lab
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.720]   has done really beautiful experiments
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.200]   where they have people exercise,
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.860]   generally it was in the morning,
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:14.640]   but at other periods of the day as well.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.600]   And what they find is that at least as late as two hours
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.680]   after that exercise,
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.240]   there's an enhancement in learning and memory.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.440]   Now, I want to be clear,
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.760]   we don't know whether or not that exercise
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.600]   led to big increases in adrenaline.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   It may be that those forms of exercise were modest enough
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.500]   or didn't challenge people enough,
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.600]   that they merely got a lot of blood flow going,
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.220]   and that the improvements in learning and memory
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.380]   were related to blood flow,
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:43.920]   and we presume increases in osteocalcin.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.280]   However, you could imagine
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.100]   a couple of different logical protocols
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.060]   based on what we've talked about.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.880]   Let's say you were going to do a form of exercise
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.560]   that was going to spike adrenaline a lot.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.420]   So this would be exercise that really challenges
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.160]   your system and forces you to kind of push through a burn.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.960]   So here I'm mainly thinking about cardiovascular exercise,
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:06.960]   but it could even be yoga, it could be resistance training.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.840]   If it's going to give you a big spike in adrenaline,
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.380]   it's going to take some serious effort,
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:15.080]   then logically speaking,
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.460]   you would want to place that after a learning bout
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:19.180]   in order to increase learning and memory.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:21.740]   However, if you're using the exercise
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.480]   in order to enhance blood flow
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.120]   and to enhance osteocalcin release
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.780]   in efforts to augment the function of your hippocampus,
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:31.760]   I think it stands to reason that doing that exercise
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.400]   sometime within the hour to three hours
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.880]   preceding an attempt to learn
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.880]   makes a lot of sense.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.480]   And there I'm basing it on the human data
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.080]   from Wendy Suzuki's lab,
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.340]   I'm basing it on the studies from Eric Kandel
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.320]   and from others labs.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.040]   Again, right now there hasn't been an evaluation
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.840]   of a lot of different protocols to arrive
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.500]   at the peer reviewed laboratory super protocol.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.640]   However, since what we're talking about
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.520]   is using activities like exercise
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.520]   that most of us probably, perhaps all of us
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.520]   should be doing regularly anyway.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.640]   And I do believe most, if not all of us
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.440]   should probably regularly be trying to learn
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.080]   and keep our brain functioning well
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.040]   and acquire new knowledge
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.740]   because it's just a wonderful part of life.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.160]   And there is evidence that that actually
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.600]   can keep your brain young, so to speak.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:19.600]   Well then exercising either before or after a learning bout
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.660]   makes a lot of sense with the emphasis
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:24.180]   on after a learning bout,
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:26.480]   if the form of exercise spikes a lot of adrenaline
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.440]   for all the reasons we talked about before.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.620]   Okay, so we've talked about two major categories
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.200]   of protocols to improve memory
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:35.240]   that are grounded in quality peer reviewed science.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.760]   And there is yet another third protocol
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.440]   that we'll talk about in a few minutes.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.760]   But before we do that,
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.320]   I want to briefly touch on an aspect of memory.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.760]   In fact, two aspects of memory
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.960]   that I get a lot of questions about.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.800]   The first one is photographic memory.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.920]   To be clear, there are people out there
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.760]   who have a true photographic memory.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.600]   They can look at a page of text,
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.840]   they can scan it with their eyes
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:00.760]   and they can essentially commit that to memory
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:03.200]   with very little, if any effort.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.920]   While it might seem that having a photographic memory
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.840]   is a very attractive skill to have,
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.040]   I should caution you against believing that
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.700]   because it turns out that people
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.260]   with true photographic memory are often very challenged
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:15.560]   at remembering things that they hear
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.800]   and oftentimes are not so good at learning physical skills.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.000]   It's not always the case, but often that's the case.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.700]   So be careful what you wish for.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:24.400]   If you do have a photographic memory,
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.580]   there are certain professions
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:29.640]   that lend themselves particularly well to you.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.760]   And indeed, a lot of people with photographic memory
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.940]   have to find a profession and have to move through life
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.840]   in a way that is in concert with that photographic memory.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.280]   So again, it's a super ability, it's a hyper ability,
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.920]   and yet it's not necessarily one
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.360]   that is desirable for most people.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360]   There's also this category
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.440]   of what are called super recognizers.
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.020]   These people are, I should mention,
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:53.320]   highly employable by government agencies.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.820]   These are people that have an absolutely astonishing ability
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:01.400]   to recognize faces and to match faces,
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.240]   to templates.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.640]   They can look at a photograph of, say,
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.360]   somebody on a most wanted list,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.160]   and then they can look at video footage of,
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.360]   let's say, an airport or a mall or a city street
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.260]   at fairly low resolution,
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:18.420]   and they can spot the person whose face matches
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.360]   that photograph that they looked at.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.360]   Even if that video or other footage is of people's profiles
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.200]   or even the tops of their heads
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.380]   and just a portion of their forehead,
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.140]   these people have just an incredible ability
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:34.440]   to recognize faces and to template match.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.560]   And again, these people often will take jobs with agencies
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.760]   where this sort of thing is important.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.560]   Some of you out there probably are super recognizers
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.140]   and may or may not notice it.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.180]   If you've ever had the experience of watching a movie
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.620]   and thought to yourself,
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:52.380]   wow, her mouth looks so much like my cousin's mouth,
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:56.340]   or you look at a character in a movie or television show
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:59.240]   and you think, wow, they look almost like
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.680]   the younger sister of so-and-so,
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.920]   well, then it's very likely that you have this,
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.080]   or at least a mild form of this super recognizer ability.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.640]   That is not memory per se.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.320]   That is the hyperfunctioning of an area of the brain
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.960]   that we call the fusiform gyrus.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.840]   The fusiform gyrus is literally a face recognition area
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.880]   and a face template matching area,
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.840]   and it harbors neurons that respond to faces generally.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.040]   So as humans and other non-human primates
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.700]   care a lot about faces and their emotional content,
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:35.020]   and the identity of faces is super important to us
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:38.200]   for all the kinds of reasons that are probably obvious,
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.900]   knowing who's friend, who's foe, who do you know well,
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.840]   who's famous, who's not famous, et cetera.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.700]   That is not memory per se.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.100]   And yet if you're a super recognizer,
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.900]   or I guess we could call it a moderate face recognizer,
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.080]   or not very good at recognizing faces,
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.200]   'cause indeed there are some people
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.900]   that are kind of face blind.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:59.040]   They don't actually recognize people.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:40:59.880]   When they walk in the room,
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.040]   I used to work with somebody like this,
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.660]   I'd walk into his office and he'd say,
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:04.960]   "Are you rich or are you Andrew?"
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.040]   I'd say, "Well, am I rich rich?
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.220]   Like, you know, wealth rich?"
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:09.060]   No.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:11.560]   And he'd say, "No, are you Richard or are you Andrew?"
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.720]   And I'd say, "I'm Andrew.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.680]   We know each other really well."
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.080]   He said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm kind of face blind."
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.920]   And it actually tend to be better or worse
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.200]   depending on how much he was working.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.080]   Ironically, the more rested he was,
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.520]   the more face blind he would become.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.160]   So it wasn't a sleep deprivation thing.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.280]   That exists, that's out there.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.200]   There's the full constellation
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.240]   of people's ability to recognize faces.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.380]   That's not really memory.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.680]   And yet visual function is a profoundly powerful way
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.140]   in which we can enhance our memory.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.800]   So whether or not you're a super recognizer of faces,
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.160]   whether or not you are face blind or anything in between,
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.400]   next I'm going to tell you about a study
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:52.120]   which points out the immense value of visual images
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.120]   for laying down memories.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   And you can leverage this information
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.280]   and this involves both the taking a photograph,
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.760]   something that's actually quite easy,
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.560]   easily done these days with your phone,
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.240]   as well as your ability to take mental photographs
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.700]   by literally snapping your eyelid shut.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.440]   So I just briefly want to describe this paper
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.760]   because it provides a tool that you can leverage
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.120]   in your attempt to learn and remember things better.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.980]   The title of this paper is "Photographic Memory,
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.120]   the effects of our volitional photo taking
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:23.680]   on memory for visual and auditory aspects of an experience."
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.780]   I really like this paper
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:27.680]   because it refers to photographic memory,
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.160]   not in the context of photographic memory
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.120]   that we normally hear about
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.760]   where people are truly photographic,
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.600]   look at a page and somehow absorb all that information
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.680]   and commit it to memory,
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.600]   but rather the use of camera photographs
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.840]   or the use of mental camera photographs,
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.400]   literally looking at something and deciding blink
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.380]   and snapping a, so to speak, snapping a snapshot
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.880]   of whatever it is that you were looking at
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.440]   and remembering the content.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.640]   The reason I like this paper
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.520]   and the reason I'm attracted to this issue
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.200]   of mental snapshots is this is something
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.360]   that I've been doing since I was a kid.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.640]   I don't know why I started doing it,
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:03.420]   but every once in a while, I would say maybe twice a year,
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.480]   I would look at something
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.440]   and decide to just snap a mental snapshot of it.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.120]   And I've maintained very clear memories
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.560]   of those visual scenes.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.800]   Two years ago, I was in an Uber and I looked out the window
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.640]   and it was a street scene.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.360]   I was actually in New York at the time
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:21.120]   and I decided for reasons that are still unclear to me
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.400]   to take a mental snapshot of this city street image,
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:26.320]   even though nothing interesting in particular was happening.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.800]   And I do recall that there was a guy wearing a yellow shirt,
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.440]   walking, there was some construction, et cetera.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.720]   I can still see that image in my mind's eye
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.560]   because I took this mental snapshot.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.440]   This paper addresses
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.780]   whether or not this mental snapshotting thing is real.
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:42.040]   And this is something that I think a lot of people
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:43.000]   will resonate with,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.840]   whether or not the constant taking of pictures on our phones
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.560]   or with other devices is either improving
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.140]   or degrading our memory.
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:52.560]   You can imagine an argument for both.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.820]   A lot of people are taking pictures
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:55.680]   that they never look at again.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.520]   And so in a sense,
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.480]   they're outsourcing their visual memory of events
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.440]   into their phone or to some other device.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.160]   And they're not ever accessing the actual image again,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.280]   they're not looking at it, right?
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.640]   You're not printing out those photos,
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:10.060]   you're not scanning through your phone again.
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:10.980]   Sometimes you might do that,
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:12.060]   but most of the time people don't.
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.520]   Most of the photographs that people take in,
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:15.000]   they're not revisiting again.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.780]   So the motivation for this study was that
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:19.720]   previous experiments had shown that
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.440]   if people take photos of a scene or a person or an object,
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.700]   that they are actually less good at remembering
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:31.220]   the details of that scene or object, et cetera.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:36.300]   This study challenged that idea and raised the hypothesis
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:39.000]   that if people are allowed to choose
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.720]   what they take photos of,
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.400]   that taking photos, again,
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.220]   this is with a camera, not mental snapshotting,
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:47.020]   that taking those photos would actually enhance their memory
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:49.680]   for those objects, those places, those people,
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.080]   and in fact, details of those object places and people.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.920]   And indeed that's what they found.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.940]   So in contrast to previous studies,
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:59.520]   where people had been more or less told,
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.380]   take photos of these following objects
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.680]   or these following people or these following places,
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.480]   and then they were given a memory test at some point later.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:11.280]   In this study, people were given volitional control, right?
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.700]   They were given agency in making the decision
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.000]   of what to take photos of.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.240]   And I'll just summarize the results.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.480]   We'll provide a link to this study.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:19.900]   I should say that some of the stuff that they tested
[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:21.520]   was actually pretty challenging.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.960]   Some of them were pottery and other forms of ceramics
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.600]   that are of the sort that you see
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.560]   if you go to a big museum in a big city,
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.480]   and if you've ever done that
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.120]   and you see all the different objects,
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.600]   there are a lot of details in those objects,
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:35.300]   and a lot of those objects look a lot alike.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:37.700]   And so, you know, some will have two handles,
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.660]   some will have one handle, the position of the handles,
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:42.500]   how broad or narrow these things are.
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.460]   You know, a lot of this is pretty detailed stuff.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:47.300]   They also took photos of other things.
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.820]   So basically what they found
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:50.860]   was that if people take pictures of things
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:53.460]   and they choose which things they're taking pictures of,
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.240]   right, it's up to them, it's volitional,
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.240]   that there's enhanced memory for those objects later on.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.380]   However, it degraded their ability
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:06.180]   to remember auditory information.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.020]   So what this means is that
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:11.060]   when we take a picture of something or a person,
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.620]   we are stamping down a visual memory of that thing,
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.840]   and that makes sense, it's a photograph after all,
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.060]   but we are actually inhibiting our ability
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:22.460]   to remember the auditory, the sound components
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.560]   of that visual scene or what the person was saying.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.460]   Very interesting, and points to the fact
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:29.140]   that the visual system can out-compete the auditory system,
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.980]   at least in terms of how the hippocampus
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:32.740]   is encoding this information.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.720]   The other finding I find particularly interesting
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.420]   within this study is that it didn't matter
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:40.520]   whether or not they ever looked at the photos again.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.940]   So they actually had people take photos
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.600]   or not take photos of different objects.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.660]   They had some people keep their photos
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.340]   and they had other people delete their photos.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:52.260]   And turns out that whether or not people kept the photos
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.980]   or deleted those photos had no bearing
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:56.420]   on whether or not they were better or worse
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.020]   at remembering things, they were always better
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:01.020]   at remembering them as compared to not taking photos of them.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:01.860]   What does this mean?
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:03.580]   It means if you really want to remember something
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:07.600]   or somebody, take a photo of that thing or person,
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.100]   pay attention while you take the photo,
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:12.020]   but it doesn't really matter if you look at the photo again.
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:14.500]   Somehow the process of taking that photo,
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.340]   probably looking at it in a camera,
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:20.240]   typically we'd say through the viewfinder now
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.260]   because of digital cameras on the screen
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:25.180]   on the back of that camera or on your phone,
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.020]   that framing up of the photograph
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.020]   stamps down a visual image in your mind
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:32.020]   that is more robust at serving a memory
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:34.980]   than had you just looked at that thing with your own eyes.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.980]   Very interesting and it raises all sorts of questions for me
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.980]   about whether or not it's because you're framing up
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.820]   a small aperture or a small portion of the visual scene.
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:44.420]   That's one logical interpretation,
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:45.920]   although they didn't test that.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.700]   I should also say that they found
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.580]   that whether or not you looked at a photo that you took
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:51.860]   or whether or not you deleted it
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:53.720]   and never looked at it again,
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.740]   didn't just enhance visual memory
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:59.000]   or the memory for the visual components of that image,
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.480]   but it always reduced your ability to remember
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.760]   sounds associated with that experience.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.300]   So that's interesting.
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:08.100]   And then last but not least,
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.380]   and perhaps most interesting, at least to me,
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.820]   was the fact that you didn't even need a camera
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:14.540]   to see this effect.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.500]   If subjects looked at something
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:19.340]   and took a mental photograph of that thing,
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:22.140]   it enhanced their visual memory of that thing
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:26.620]   significantly more than had they not taken a mental picture.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.260]   In fact, it increased their memory of that thing
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.760]   almost as much as taking an actual photograph
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:34.360]   with an actual camera.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.340]   And the reason I find this so interesting
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:40.500]   is that a lot of what we try and learn is visual.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:41.900]   And for a lot of people,
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:45.900]   the ability to learn visual information feels challenging
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.020]   and we'll look at something
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.860]   and we'll try and create some detailed understanding of it.
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:51.260]   We'll try and understand the relationships
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.380]   between things in that scene.
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:54.940]   It does appear based on the study
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:58.380]   that the mere decision to take a mental snapshot,
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.880]   like, okay, I'm going to blink my eyelids
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.700]   and I'm going to take a snapshot of whatever it is I see,
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:04.220]   can actually stamp down a visual memory
[01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.580]   much in the same way
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.760]   that a camera can stamp down a visual memory,
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.680]   of course, through vastly distinct mechanisms.
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.220]   No discussion of memory would be complete
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:17.100]   without a discussion of the ever intriguing phenomenon
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:19.260]   known as deja vu.
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.220]   This sense that we've experienced something
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.500]   before but we can't quite put our finger on it.
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:24.980]   Where and when did it happen?
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:27.260]   Or the sense that we've been someplace before
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:30.220]   or that we are in a familiar state
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.600]   or place or context of some kind.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.380]   Now, I've talked about this on the podcast before,
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.860]   at least I think I have,
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:41.000]   and the way this works has been defined
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.060]   largely by the wonderful work of Susumu Tonogawa
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:47.340]   at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:50.660]   Susumu collected a Nobel Prize quite appropriately
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:52.920]   for his beautiful work on immunology
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.620]   and he's also a highly accomplished neuroscientist
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:58.860]   who studies memory and learning and deja vu.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:01.860]   And I should also mention the beautiful work of Mark Mayford
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:04.620]   at the Scripps Institute in UC San Diego,
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:06.660]   beautiful work on this notion of deja vu.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.720]   Here's what they discovered.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.220]   They evaluated the patterns of neural firing
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:16.220]   in the hippocampus as subjects learn new things, okay?
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:20.020]   So neuron A fires, then neuron B fires,
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:22.820]   then neuron C fires in a particular sequence.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:25.800]   Again, the firing of neurons in a particular sequence,
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.500]   like the playing of keys on a piano
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:28.360]   in a particular sequence
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.020]   leads to a particular song on the piano
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:32.180]   and leads to a particular memory
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:34.020]   of an experience within the brain.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:39.220]   They then used some molecular tools and tricks
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:41.940]   to label and capture those neurons
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:43.980]   such that they could go back later
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:47.980]   and activate those neurons in either the same sequence
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:51.140]   or in a different sequence to the one that occurred
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.660]   during the formation of the memory.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.220]   And to make a long story short
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:57.300]   and to summarize multiple papers
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:00.540]   published in incredibly high tier journals,
[01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:02.060]   journals like Nature and Science,
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.800]   which are extremely stringent,
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.800]   found that whether or not those particular neurons
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.680]   were played in the precise sequence
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:13.380]   that happened when they encoded the memory
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:15.140]   or whether or not those neurons were played
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.660]   in a different sequence
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.580]   or even if those neurons were played,
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:24.580]   activated that is, all at once with no temporal sequence,
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:27.540]   all firing in concert all at once,
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:33.580]   evoked the same behavior and in some sense, the same memory.
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:38.940]   So at a neural circuit level, this is deja vu.
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.820]   This is a different pattern of firing of neurons
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:46.220]   in the brain leading to the same sense of what happened
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:51.120]   leading to a particular emotional state or behavior.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.180]   Now, whether or not this same sort of phenomenon occurs
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.420]   when you're walking down the street
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:57.160]   and suddenly you feel as if,
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.580]   wow, I feel like I've been here before.
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:59.740]   You meet someone and you feel like,
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.180]   gosh, I feel like I know you.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:03.340]   I feel like there's some familiarity here
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.760]   that I can't quite put my finger on.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.660]   We don't know for sure that that's what's happening,
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:11.820]   but this is the most mechanistic and logical explanation
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:15.740]   for what has for many decades, if not hundreds of years,
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.660]   has been described as deja vu.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:20.500]   So for those of you that experienced deja vu often,
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.660]   just know that this reflects a normal pattern
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:27.940]   of encoding experiences and events within your hippocampus.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.820]   I'm not aware of any pathological situations
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:34.820]   where the presence of deja vu inhibits daily life.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:37.420]   Some people like the sensation of deja vu,
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:38.620]   other people don't.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:41.820]   Almost everybody, however, describes it as somewhat eerie.
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:44.300]   This idea that even though you're in a very different place,
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.900]   even though you're interacting with a very different person,
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.980]   that you could somehow feel as if this has happened before.
[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:53.760]   And just realize this, that your hippocampus,
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.700]   while it is exquisitely good at encoding
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:02.700]   new types of perceptions, new experiences, new emotions,
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:07.180]   new contingencies and relationships of life events,
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.900]   it is not infinitely large,
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.780]   nor does it have an infinite bucket
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.220]   full of different options of different sequences
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.540]   for those neurons to play.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.820]   So in a lot of ways, it makes perfect sense
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:20.620]   that sometimes we would feel as if a given experience
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.100]   had happened previously.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.820]   I'd like to cover one additional tool that you can use
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:26.380]   to improve learning and memory.
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:29.500]   And I should mention, this is a particularly powerful one,
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:33.420]   and it's one that I'm definitely going to employ myself.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:36.860]   This is based on a paper from none other
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:39.360]   than Wendy Suzuki at New York University.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.980]   We talked about her a little bit earlier.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:42.900]   And again, she's going to be on the podcast
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:46.380]   in our next episode and is just an incredible researcher.
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:47.820]   I've known Wendy for a number of years,
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:50.200]   and it's only in the last, I would say five or six years,
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.340]   that she's really shifted her laboratory
[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:56.100]   toward generating protocols that human beings can use.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.580]   And she's putting that to great effect,
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:00.420]   great positive effect, I should say,
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:02.520]   publishing papers of the sort that I'm about to describe,
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.480]   but also incorporating some of these tools and protocols
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.260]   into the learning curriculum
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:10.380]   and the lifestyle curriculum of students at NYU,
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:12.540]   which I think is a terrific initiative.
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.020]   So you don't need to be an NYU student
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.620]   in order to benefit from her work.
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:17.100]   I'm going to tell you about some of that work now,
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.740]   and she'll tell you about this and much more
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.640]   in the episode that follows this one.
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.980]   The title of this paper will tell you a lot
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:24.920]   about where we're going.
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:28.740]   The title is "Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention,
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.220]   Memory, Mood, and Emotional Regulation
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:33.900]   in Non-Experienced Meditators."
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.040]   If ever there was an incentive to meditate,
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.300]   it is the data contained within this paper.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.860]   I want to briefly describe the study,
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:44.420]   and then I also want to emphasize
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:47.500]   that when you meditate is absolutely critical.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.540]   I'll talk about that just at the end.
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:54.180]   This is a study that involves subjects aged 18 to 45,
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:56.380]   none of whom were experienced meditators
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:57.500]   prior to this study.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:01.460]   There were two general groups in this study.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:06.800]   One group did a 13-minute long meditation,
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.940]   and this meditation was a fairly conventional meditation.
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.840]   They would sit or lie down.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.220]   They would do somewhat of a body scan,
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.460]   evaluating, for instance,
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.700]   how tense or relaxed they felt throughout their body,
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.560]   and they would focus on their breathing,
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.480]   trying to bring their attention back to their breathing
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.200]   and to the state of their body as the meditation progressed.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.740]   The other group, which we can call the control group,
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:31.660]   listened to, of all things, a podcast.
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.480]   They did not listen to this podcast.
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:36.620]   They listened to "Radio Lab," which is a popular podcast
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.520]   for an equivalent amount of time,
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.720]   but they were not instructed to do any kind of body scan
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.300]   or pay attention to their breathing.
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:46.240]   Every subject in the study either meditated daily
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:49.400]   or listened to a equivalent duration podcast daily
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.840]   for a period of eight weeks.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.060]   And the experimenters measured a large number of things,
[01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:58.020]   of variables, as we say.
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.500]   They looked at measures of emotion regulation.
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.980]   They actually measured cortisol, a stress hormone.
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:05.200]   They measured, as the title suggests,
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.740]   attention and memory and so forth.
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:12.260]   And the basic takeaway of the study is that eight weeks,
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:16.240]   but not four weeks, of this daily 13-minute-a-day meditation
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.240]   had a significant effect in improving attention, memory,
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.080]   mood, and emotion regulation.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:26.820]   I find this study to be very interesting
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.080]   and, in fact, important because most of us have heard
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.860]   about the positive effects of meditation
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.080]   on things like stress reduction
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.700]   or on things such as improving sleep.
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:39.280]   And I want to come back to sleep in a few moments
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.100]   'cause it turns out to be a very important feature
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:41.940]   of this study.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:45.660]   This particular study I like so much
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:49.880]   because they used a really broad array of measurements
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.260]   for cognitive function,
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:53.260]   things like the Wisconsin card sorting task.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:54.220]   I'm not going to go into this.
[01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:55.600]   Things like the Stroop task.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.700]   And they also, as I mentioned, measured cortisol
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:03.260]   and many other things, including, not surprisingly, memory.
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:05.620]   And people's ability to remember
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:06.740]   certain types of information,
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:08.800]   in fact, varied types of information.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:11.740]   And the basic takeaway was, again,
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:14.180]   that you could get really robust improvements
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:16.720]   in learning and memory, mood, and attention
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:19.620]   from just 13 minutes a day of meditation.
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:21.380]   Now, there's an important twist in this study
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:22.780]   that I want to emphasize.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:25.260]   If you read into the discussion of this study,
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:30.100]   it's mentioned that somehow meditation did not improve
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:32.340]   but actually impaired sleep quality
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.240]   compared to the control subjects.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:36.080]   You might think, wow, why would that be?
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.860]   I mean, meditation is supposed to reduce our stress.
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:40.680]   Stress is supposed to inhibit sleep.
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:44.460]   And therefore, why would sleep get worse?
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:47.040]   Well, what's interesting is the time of day
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:51.200]   when most of these subjects tended to do their meditation.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.680]   Most of the subjects in this study
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:54.400]   did their meditation late in the day.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.060]   This is often the case in experiments.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:58.260]   I know this because we run experiments
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:59.840]   with human subjects in my laboratory.
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.040]   And people are paid some amount of money
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.100]   in order to participate,
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.400]   or they're given something as compensation
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:06.240]   for being in the study.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.580]   But oftentimes, the meditation, or in the case of my lab,
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:12.560]   the respiration work or other kinds of things
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.500]   that they're assigned to do are not their top, top priority.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:16.580]   And we understand this.
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.020]   But in this study, the majority of subjects here I'm reading
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.340]   completed their meditation sessions
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:24.460]   from somewhere between 8 and 11 p.m.
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:27.660]   and sometimes even between 12 and 3 a.m.
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:29.280]   I think there probably were a lot of college students
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:30.460]   enrolled in this study.
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:33.640]   And their hours often are late shifted.
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:35.320]   That impaired sleep.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:37.740]   And this raises a bigger theme that I think is important
[01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:39.700]   many times before on this podcast
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:41.640]   and certainly in the episode on mastering sleep
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:44.580]   and conquering or mastering stress.
[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:46.820]   Those episodes, we talked about the value, again,
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:49.840]   of these non-sleep deep rest protocols, NSDR,
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.980]   for reducing the activity of your sympathetic nervous system,
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:56.420]   the alertness, so-called stress arm
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.960]   of your autonomic nervous system,
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.420]   that makes you feel really alert.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:04.420]   NSDR is superb for reducing your level of alertness,
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.780]   increasing your level of calmness,
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:06.720]   and putting you into a so-called
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:09.860]   more parasympathetic relaxed state.
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:14.200]   Meditation does that too, but it also increases attention.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.240]   If you think about meditation,
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.580]   meditation involves focusing on your breath
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.600]   and constantly focusing back on your breath
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:23.020]   and trying to avoid the distraction of things you're thinking
[01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:24.260]   or things that you're hearing
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:28.000]   and coming so-called back to your body, back to your breath.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000]   So meditation actually has a high attentional load.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.720]   It requires a lot of prefrontal cortical activity
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.100]   that's involved in attention,
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:40.680]   which then logically relates
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.840]   to one of the outcomes of this study,
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.640]   which is that attention abilities
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.840]   improved in daily meditators.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.640]   It also points out that increasing the level of attention
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.060]   and the activity of your prefrontal cortex may,
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:53.980]   and I want to emphasize may
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:56.540]   because here I'm speculating about the underlying mechanism,
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:59.060]   inhibit your ability to fall asleep.
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:01.140]   So while we have meditation on the one hand
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:03.060]   that does tend to put us into a calm state,
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:05.560]   but it is a calm, very focused state.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.140]   In fact, attention and focus are inherent
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:10.040]   to most forms of meditation.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.740]   Non-sleep deep rest, such as yoga nidra,
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:16.060]   as some of you know it to be, or NSDR.
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:19.220]   There's a terrific NSDR script that's available free online
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.420]   that's put out by Made For.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.380]   So you can go to YouTube, NSDR Made For.
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:25.100]   You can also just do a search for NSDR.
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:26.900]   There are a number of these available out there,
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.860]   again, at no cost.
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:32.340]   Those NSDR protocols tend to put people
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:34.620]   into a state of deep relaxation,
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:37.960]   but also very low attention.
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:41.140]   And we have to assume very low activation
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.660]   of the prefrontal cortex.
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:44.600]   So the takeaways from the study are several fold.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.260]   First of all, that daily meditation of 13 minutes
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:51.300]   can enhance your ability to pay attention and to learn.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.400]   It can truly enhance memory.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:57.940]   However, you need to do that for at least eight weeks
[02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:00.660]   in order to start to see the effects to occur.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:02.900]   And we have to presume that you have to continue
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:05.280]   those meditation training sessions.
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:08.340]   In fact, they found that if people
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:09.740]   only did four weeks of meditation,
[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:11.020]   these effects didn't show up.
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:13.020]   Now, eight weeks might seem like a long time,
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.620]   but I think that 13 minutes a day
[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:18.500]   is not actually that big of a time commitment.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:21.440]   And the results of this study certainly incentivize me
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:24.860]   to start adopting a, I'm going for 15 minutes a day now.
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:27.740]   I've been a on and off meditator for a number of years.
[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:29.180]   I've been pretty good about it lately,
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:31.940]   but I confess I've been doing far shorter meditations
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:34.660]   of anywhere from three to five or maybe 10 minutes.
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:37.540]   I'm going to ramp that up to 15 minutes a day.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:39.540]   And I'm doing that specifically to try
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:42.260]   and access these improvements in cognitive ability
[02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:43.700]   and our abilities to learn.
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:45.740]   Also based on the data in this paper,
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:47.500]   I'm going to do those meditation sessions
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:48.980]   either early in the day,
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:52.960]   such as immediately after waking or close to it.
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:54.820]   I might get my sunshine first.
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:55.660]   As you all know,
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:57.640]   very big on getting sunlight in the eyes early in the day
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:00.200]   as much as one can and as early as one can
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:02.720]   once the sun is out,
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:04.920]   but certainly doing it early in the day
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:07.640]   and not past 5 PM or so
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:09.920]   in order to make sure that I don't inhibit sleep.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.940]   Because I think this result that they describe
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:14.880]   of meditation inhibiting quality sleep
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.880]   compared to controls is an important one
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:20.180]   to pay attention to, no pun intended.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:22.560]   Today, we covered a lot of aspects of memory
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.480]   and how to improve your memory.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:26.260]   We talked about the different forms of memory
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.840]   and we talked about some of the underlying neural circuitry
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.340]   of memory formation.
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:34.020]   And we talked about how the emotional saliency
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:36.440]   and intensity of what you're trying to learn
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:40.100]   has a profound impact on whether or not you learn
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:41.980]   in response to some sort of experience,
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:44.540]   whether or not that experience is reading
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.000]   or mathematics or music or language or a physical skill.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.240]   It doesn't matter.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.080]   The more intense of an emotional state that you're in
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.040]   in the period immediately following that learning,
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:59.420]   the more likely you are to remember
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:01.440]   whatever it is that you're trying to learn.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.800]   And we talked about the neurochemicals
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.560]   that explain that effect,
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.320]   about epinephrine and corticosterones like cortisol
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.580]   and how adjusting the timing of those
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:13.280]   is so key to enhancing your memory.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.600]   And we talked about the different ways
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:15.660]   to enhance those chemicals,
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:19.200]   everything ranging from cold water to pharmacology
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.420]   and even just adjusting the emotional state within your mind
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:26.080]   in order to stamp down and remember experiences better.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.140]   We also talked about how to leverage exercise
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:31.700]   in particular load-bearing exercise
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:34.760]   in order to evoke the release of hormones like osteocalcin,
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:36.520]   which can travel from your bones to your brain
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.520]   and enhance your ability to learn.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.000]   And we talked about a new form of photographic memory,
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.800]   not the traditional type of photographic memory
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:44.920]   in which people can remember
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:47.160]   everything they look at very easily,
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:50.460]   but rather taking mental snapshots of things that you see.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:53.320]   Again, emphasizing that that will create a better memory
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.560]   of what you see when you take that mental snapshot,
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.600]   but will actually reduce your memory
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:59.660]   for the things that you hear at that moment.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:01.240]   And we discussed the really exciting data
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.960]   looking at how particular meditation protocols
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.660]   can enhance memory, but also attention and mood.
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:10.740]   However, if done too late in the day,
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:12.780]   can actually disrupt sleep precisely
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:17.340]   because those meditation protocols can enhance attention.
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:18.800]   Now, I know that many of you are interested
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.380]   in neurochemicals that can enhance learning and memory,
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:26.600]   and I intend to cover those in deep detail
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:28.000]   in a future episode.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.240]   However, for sake of what was discussed today,
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:34.320]   please understand that any number of different neurochemicals
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.280]   can evoke or can increase the amount of adrenaline
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.600]   that's circulating in your brain and body.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.120]   And it's less important how one accesses
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.980]   that increase in adrenaline, right?
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:46.900]   Again, this can be done through behavioral protocols
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:48.240]   or through pharmacology.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:51.840]   Assuming that those behavioral protocols
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.860]   and pharmacology are safe for you,
[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:56.660]   it really doesn't matter how you evoke the adrenaline release
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:05:00.160]   because remember, adrenaline is the final common pathway
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:02.280]   by which particular experiences,
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.640]   particular perceptions are stamped into memory,
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.960]   which answers our very first question
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:09.300]   raised at the beginning of the episode,
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:12.380]   which is why do we remember anything at all, right?
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:14.260]   That was the question that we raised.
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:16.080]   Why is it that from morning till night
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.380]   and throughout your entire life,
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:19.720]   you have tons of sensory experience, tons of perceptions,
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:23.160]   why is it that some are remembered and others are not?
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:26.740]   While I would never want to distill an important question
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:29.840]   such as that down to a one-molecule type of answer,
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:31.760]   I think we can confidently say,
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:36.140]   based on the vast amount of animal and human research data,
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:39.900]   that epinephrine, adrenaline, and some of the other chemicals
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:44.380]   that it acts with in concert is in fact the way
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:49.020]   that we remember particular events and not all events.
[02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:51.460]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:23.520]   We also have a Patreon.
[02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:26.280]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:29.580]   at any level that you like.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.940]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:34.880]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:37.200]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:39.320]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:41.400]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.480]   and indeed for learning and memory.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.340]   For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:47.760]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:50.420]   The reason we partnered with Momentous is several fold.
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:52.600]   First of all, we wanted to have one location
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:55.560]   where people could go to access single ingredient,
[02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:57.400]   high quality versions of the supplements
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.760]   that we were discussing on this podcast.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:00.980]   This is a critical issue.
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:02.580]   A lot of supplement companies out there
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:03.780]   sell excellent supplements,
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:05.720]   but they combine different ingredients
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:07.080]   into different formulations,
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.640]   which make it very hard to figure out
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.120]   exactly what works for you
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:12.800]   and to arrive at the minimal effective dose
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.940]   of the various compounds that are best for you,
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:16.800]   which we think is extremely important.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.760]   And that's certainly the most scientific way
[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.320]   or rigorous way to approach
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.240]   any kind of supplementation regimen.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:24.880]   So Momentous has made these single ingredient formulations
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.260]   on the basis of what we suggested to them.
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.040]   And I'm happy to say they also ship internationally.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:32.060]   So whether or not you're in the US or abroad,
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:32.920]   they'll ship to you.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.700]   If you'd like to see the supplements recommended
[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:36.460]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:40.040]   you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.000]   They've started to assemble the supplements
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.500]   that we've talked about on the podcast.
[02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:45.180]   And in the upcoming weeks,
[02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:47.180]   they will be adding many more supplements
[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:50.560]   such that in a brief period of time,
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:52.300]   most, if not all of the compounds
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.020]   that are discussed on this podcast
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:56.620]   will be there again in single ingredient,
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:58.480]   extremely high quality formulations
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:07:59.660]   that you can use to arrive
[02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:01.980]   at the best supplement protocols for you.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:04.100]   We also include behavioral protocols
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:06.520]   that can be combined with supplementation protocols
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:08.800]   in order to deliver the maximum effect.
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:12.140]   Once again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.620]   And if you're not already following us
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.200]   on Twitter and Instagram,
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:18.140]   it's Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:21.220]   There, I describe science and science-related tools,
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:22.820]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:24.060]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:25.440]   but much of which is distinct
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:27.780]   from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.180]   We also have a newsletter
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.720]   called the Huberman Lab Neural Network.
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:33.880]   That newsletter provides summary protocols
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:36.880]   and information from our various podcast episodes.
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:38.480]   It does not cost anything to sign up.
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:40.400]   You can go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.700]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:43.780]   You just provide your email.
[02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:44.620]   And I should point out,
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:46.420]   we do not share your email with anyone else.
[02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:48.780]   We have a very clear privacy policy
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:50.300]   that you can read there.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:52.260]   And that newsletter comes out about once a month.
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:53.960]   You can also see some sample newsletters,
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:57.300]   things like the toolkit for sleep or for neuroplasticity
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:58.520]   and for various other topics
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.540]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:02.540]   Once again, thank you for joining me today
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:04.780]   to discuss the neurobiology of learning and memory
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:08.580]   and how to improve your memory using science-based tools.
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:10.620]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:12.480]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.060]   [upbeat music]
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:17.640]   (upbeat music)
