[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.480]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.240]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.000]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find All The
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.440]   Hacks.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.080]   Today's conversation is one I am certain you'll remember because it is all about
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.480]   memory.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.160]   I'm joined by Johannes Malow, who stumbled on memory sports in 2003 after
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   watching a TV talent show and has since been crowned world memory champion
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.360]   twice, most recently in 2018, and has won the German memory championship four
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.000]   times.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.520]   He's competed all over the world for the past 18 years and is currently ranked
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.320]   number nine in the world by the International Association of Memory.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.360]   Some of his personal records include memorizing a random list of 1014
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.760]   numbers in 15 minutes and memorizing the order of a randomly shuffled deck of
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   cards in under 25 seconds.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.040]   In our conversation, we'll hear about the mental and physical struggles
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.000]   Johannes had to overcome to be a world champion.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960]   We'll learn about the techniques he uses to memorize things most of us assume are
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.880]   impossible, and we'll discuss how we can use these techniques for things in our
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.280]   personal and professional life.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.880]   I am so excited for this episode, so let's jump in.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.600]   Johannes, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.880]   Chris, thank you very much for having me.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.800]   And yeah, looking forward to that today and for your questions.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   So, you know, I mentioned a couple of the records you hold, but I don't think
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.320]   most people know what a world memory championship even is.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.760]   So I thought it might be good to start.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.680]   What is it?
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   What happens at these events and what kinds of things have you accomplished
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800]   to be crowned the champion?
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.480]   Yeah, so in general, a world championship is a three days event
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.040]   happening somewhere in the world.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.480]   And usually it's like a big exam.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.720]   So a huge exam.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.280]   Hundreds of people sitting down at their desk and they will be given a sheet of
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.680]   paper with, for example, numbers or names or words, and then they have a specific
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.480]   amount of time to memorize these lists.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.200]   So for example, there's one discipline out of 10, which you mentioned is, for
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.840]   example, 15 minute numbers.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.000]   So you have a sheet of paper with digits on it and you have 15 minutes to memorize
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.400]   as many as you can, and then they collect these sheets of paper and then you get a
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.360]   recall sheet and you have to write them down.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.400]   So, and that is just one discipline out of 10 for the world championship.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.000]   And it's spread out over three days.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.040]   For example, one discipline is one hour numbers.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.520]   So you have to memorize for one hour, as many digits as you can, or one hour cards.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.280]   So you have to memorize playing cards, as many as you can within one hour.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.120]   And that is really exhausting.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   So it's unbelievable exhausting actually.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.600]   So that's actually what a world memory championship works like 10 disciplines,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.160]   names, cards, numbers, and so on.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.400]   And in the end, overall, you get points for each discipline and the overall
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.600]   champion is the one with the most points over all the disciplines.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.680]   And that I became twice in 2018 and 2012, having the most points out of these 10
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.160]   disciplines in the world championship.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.360]   Is there one discipline that's kind of known within all of the competitors that
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.440]   is the hardest one that, you know, whoever can win this one is likely to be the
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.960]   champion?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.000]   Actually, I think the last one, this is called speed cards.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.960]   This is the most exciting stuff.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.280]   And it's, you have an actual deck of cards, 52 playing cards, and it is
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.200]   shuffled, and then you have to memorize it as fast as you can in the correct
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.440]   order, all the cards, the 52 cards.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   And then when you're done, you put it away and you get a second deck of cards,
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.520]   which is in the correct order of the cards.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.240]   And then you have to put this ordered deck of cards into the order of the
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.720]   shuffled deck of cards, which you just memorized.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.880]   And the crucial thing here is that this is the last discipline.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.640]   And if you make one mistake, like just swap two cards, for example, then you
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.280]   just get zero points for that deck.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.000]   And that's the toughest thing because you can't really make a mistake.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.920]   Otherwise you just get zero points instead of 800 and then you lose the
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   championship.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.160]   And so the pressure is on.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.520]   You need to do that right now.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.760]   And everyone is watching.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.720]   And yeah, you have to memorize a deck of cards, maybe in 30 seconds, 25, 20
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   seconds, this is what we're up to today in the World of Memory competitions, 20
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.160]   seconds.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.880]   The world record is actually 12.76 seconds for memorizing a deck of cards
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.040]   with 52 playing cards.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.560]   I have so many questions about how you do it, how you feel, but when you're in
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.360]   that final moment of competing in the last discipline, are there things you do
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.320]   to prepare yourself?
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.640]   Yes.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.240]   I try to relax.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.600]   Easier said than done.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.640]   But actually I try to imagine myself being at home again, being at my desk at
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.240]   home in a training situation.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.920]   So I close my eyes.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.000]   I imagine myself being at home at my training desk and just hearing the sound
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.640]   what I hear, usually in my home, feeling the desk and so on.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.040]   So like bringing me back in this relaxing situation and that calms me down and my
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.800]   heart rate drops and I become more relaxed.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.960]   So it's like a small meditation, you might call it like that.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   And this works pretty well for me.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.600]   Breathe slowly in, slowly out, just for a minute and then I am ready to go.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.160]   Wow.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.920]   So if anyone listening wants to see some of these competitions, there's lots of
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.400]   videos online and I highly recommend looking it up.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.200]   It's really kind of exciting to watch someone memorize this deck of cards so
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.680]   quickly.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.200]   Is this something you always knew you would do or how did you get into this, I
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   guess, career of memory sports?
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.000]   And my mother would say I was always into memorizing because I always beat my
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.400]   parents in memory playing cards when I was a child.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.480]   But of course, every child is beating their parents in playing memory.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.760]   So I wasn't into that in any way before I finished school.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.320]   And when I was when I turned 22 and went to my studies, then I just came across
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.680]   this memory sports.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.040]   Like you told before, I saw this talent show on the TV and someone memorized the
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.560]   deck of cards and the list of words.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   And I was like, OK, if she can do it, I can do it, too.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.240]   And then I went to the Internet, did some research.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.680]   So I started in my early 20s with that and then I somehow got addicted to doing
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.600]   that again and again and again because I saw myself climbing up the ladder of
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.880]   rankings. And that was really motivating for me.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.320]   So at first it was just a competition thing.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.600]   And then later I started doing also memory for my studies.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:42.280]   And then at another point, I started training kids in how to learn better for
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.640]   school, but also doing just memory competitions.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.280]   So, yeah, it's it's all like right now since 18 years I'm doing that.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.440]   Wow. And I know you mentioned on your website, the physical issues you faced
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.000]   played a big role in kind of pushing you to do this.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   Could you talk a little bit about that journey?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.840]   Sure. Sure.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.120]   Little is not easy to take just a little about it because it's a longer story.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.560]   But I'm facing a physical muscle disease.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.240]   That means that my muscles are going down.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.440]   And this disease is called FSHD and it's also very well known in the US.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.120]   There's a big organization about it.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.080]   So I was facing that when I turned 14 already.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.280]   And then it started with my legs.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.960]   So my left leg becomes thinner and thinner and the muscles decrease there.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.880]   And I was falling down to the floor and I couldn't go and play table tennis
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.760]   anymore. I was quite OK.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.160]   Good table tennis player.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.960]   And I couldn't do that anymore.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.880]   So it was a slight start.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.080]   And then I went to the hospital and they tried to find out what is it about.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.480]   And then they found, OK, this is a genetic disease which affects my muscles and
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   they will go down over time.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.000]   But they couldn't say how long it will take to maybe do I have to use a
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.520]   wheelchair or not and so on.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.440]   And then I just tried to forget about that because you are 15, 16.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.080]   You try to, I don't know, you try to go to a party or get a girlfriend or
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:21.320]   whatever. And I just didn't want to be too much involved into that.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.280]   So I didn't do anything about it at this point because I couldn't do anything.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.800]   And then when I turned 20, 21, 22, it was the time that I had a hard time
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.720]   walking and it becomes more difficult.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.440]   And in my 20s, I was very depressed about that because it was like aging
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.040]   early. It really felt like I was already 70 years old or 80 years old and
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.680]   everything goes down with my body.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.640]   And I felt bad about it.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.560]   I was depressed.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.640]   My self-confidence goes down.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.600]   But then there was memory sports and memory sports was my door into another
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.680]   world because that gave me the opportunity to travel the world, to meet
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.760]   other people who are also interested in this memory stuff and most important, to
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.560]   compete against others because I was always very competitive.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.160]   But with this muscle disease, you couldn't do any competitive sport anymore.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   But memory sports was possible.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.320]   And then I thought, OK, I can try to be the German champion.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.480]   And then I won that.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.520]   And then I was like, OK, maybe I can be the world champion once.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.160]   And I tried my best and finished second and finished second again in the world
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.320]   championship. And I was depressed about that.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.960]   Actually, second in the world is quite good, but I was depressed anyway.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:42.160]   And but because I was not accepting my disease at this point, then I went to a
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.560]   doctor, a psychologist, and she helped me a lot.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   And then at some point I had to say, OK, I have to use a wheelchair if I want to
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.680]   be a world champion.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.760]   I have to travel there.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.280]   And if I want to travel there, I cannot walk anymore.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.080]   It's too tough.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.480]   I fall down to this floor all the time.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.640]   It's so dangerous.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.520]   And then I have to decide, OK, I take a wheelchair now, go to the world
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.040]   championship and try to win it.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.320]   And actually, that was one of the most important steps back then to just accept
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.480]   it, use a wheelchair.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.800]   And now the wheelchair means freedom for me.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.240]   And that moment, becoming the world champion in 2012, was the best moment in
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.200]   my life, I would say, because I went through so much trouble, 10 years of
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   depression and being down and fighting this disease and fighting myself and
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.520]   trying to be the best in the world and failing.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.640]   And then sitting there in the last discipline, speed karts, sitting there
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.120]   and saying, OK, now you have to memorize a stack in about 40 seconds.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.640]   That's enough this time.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.040]   Just do it.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.080]   And I failed the first attempt.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.840]   And then I had one attempt left.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.640]   You have two attempts.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.920]   And I was like, OK, now everything counts.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.040]   Now it's this moment.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.360]   Everything comes together here.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.920]   And then I did it somehow.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.680]   I was shaking, but I did it.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.160]   And then I was a world champion.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.120]   And that was really like, yeah, it was a huge emotional moment for me.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.440]   Thank you for kind of opening up and sharing things that people don't often
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.040]   talk about.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.160]   Are there things that if you look back, you think steps along the way that helped
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.240]   you push through the really hard parts of that journey?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.320]   Yeah, when I think back, it's obviously that friends, good friends are very
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.560]   important. So because if you can rely on even if it's just one person you can
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.400]   rely on and you can talk to, that's very, very important in these situations.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.520]   And that's one point.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.960]   And the other point was taking professional help here.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.680]   So going to the psychologist was very, very important for me.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.640]   And sometimes you try to do it by yourself.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.680]   And I tried for years.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.720]   But getting help from outside was the key to survive here.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.120]   Yeah. And do you think, obviously, you said you started getting into memory
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.360]   without any intention of it.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.400]   You saw it on TV.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.720]   Do you think a gifted memory like yours is something that can be trained or and
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.120]   needs natural talent?
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.520]   Or do you think it's something that anyone can do and learn on their own?
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.120]   And yeah, that's a good point, because people always think, oh, this is a highly
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.000]   gifted guy, talented.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.600]   And you were always doing it like since you were a kid.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.320]   It's not it's not true because I was start learning that.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.480]   And of course, I think if you want to go to the top 10 in the world or you want to
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.280]   be the world champion, I guess there is some talent involved for that, because
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   otherwise everyone could be a world champion.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:43.320]   But for increasing your own memory skills by using memory techniques, that's
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.720]   something everyone can do and everyone can have a huge, huge boost for their own
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.920]   memories with these techniques.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.800]   Not everyone can get around 100 meters in under 10 seconds.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.200]   But if you try hard, you maybe can be 12 or 13 seconds.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.120]   So that's the same about memory.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   You found this thing at age 19.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.800]   You weren't even thinking about really in any professional way.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.320]   And then you stumbled on it and then you were world champion.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   Are there other things that you think you now realize maybe you'd be the best poker
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.600]   player in the world?
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:24.120]   And has that led you to explore new disciplines or skills that you might have
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.040]   and you didn't know about?
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.480]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.760]   You try things.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.440]   If you have this skill, these memory skills.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.320]   Poker doesn't work because you always get new cards.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.960]   And I mean, two cards, memorizing two cards should be possible for everyone.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.520]   And but of course, I was thinking about beating blackjack, memorizing these
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.600]   cards, a sequence of cards that are out there and such stuff.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.240]   But I mean, I'm not rich, so it didn't work so well because casinos really take
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.880]   care of changing the deck of cards nowadays.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.440]   So they change the deck of cards and then you don't have any advantage anymore.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.000]   But on the other hand, what one thing would really increase for myself, which I
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   realized not in the first place, but later is my creativity, because when you
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.240]   train your memory, it's all about strategies.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.400]   And these strategies involve creating visual images, connecting stuff to each
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.600]   other, which is not related to each other.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:27.080]   And doing that over and over again, it looks like that I'm, yeah, my creativity
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:33.720]   really increased a lot because I sometimes I feel I see connections where no one
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.440]   else sees the connection, and that really helps me in my business, daily
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.680]   life and in brainstorming sessions.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.520]   So yeah, this is really one thing what improved a lot here.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.560]   That's awesome.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.640]   I want to dig into how you do that kind of exercise and practice.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.120]   But before, I thought it might be really helpful, maybe you could walk me through
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.000]   an example of what it looks like to actually use a memory technique to
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.240]   memorize something, and we can kind of explore that together.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.760]   Okay, let's do that.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.960]   So the most popular memory technique is the memory palace.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.720]   Maybe you have heard about it.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.840]   It's also in some pop culture, like Sherlock Holmes is using the memory palace.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:26.000]   So the memory palace is more than 2000 years old, and this is a technique where
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   you walk or you have a mental walk, for example, through your apartment or house.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.320]   So imagine yourself standing in the front of your door.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.040]   So that's the first location.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.280]   You say, okay, door is the first location, and then you enter your
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.600]   apartment and then what comes to the left?
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.080]   What is there for you, Chris?
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.200]   What is on the left when you come into your apartment?
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.960]   When I walk in the door on the left is the living room.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.200]   The living room.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.560]   Okay.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.480]   So you enter the living room and what's there?
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.960]   Is there any furniture?
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.920]   Is it TV or a chair or what is it?
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.680]   There's two sofas and a coffee table.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.520]   Okay.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.280]   So, and the trick is to do it in a specific direction.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.240]   So I entered my apartment and to the left, there is a wardrobe.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.040]   And then I pass the wardrobe and I go to the left, there's my bathroom.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.440]   And there is the first thing is the laundry machine.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.720]   And then I go around the room, like going clockwise through my room.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.760]   So that's what I do.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.400]   And what would happen with you if you do that?
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.080]   So you enter your room and then what comes to the left?
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.840]   Try to go clockwise through your living room here.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.920]   Door is number one.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.560]   And then what comes if you go clockwise through your living room?
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.800]   If I go clockwise, there's, my daughter has a little table that she has all
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.600]   her little books on is the first thing.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.200]   Then there's a couch, then there's a fireplace, and then, then it's kind of
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.080]   all connected in one room to the dining room.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.120]   So there's a big dining room table.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.480]   And then that actually connects to the kitchen.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.800]   So there's a island in the kitchen with a sink and, and the
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.000]   fridge is over there and the stove.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.760]   Let's, let's start with these.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.960]   So we have front door.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.480]   We have your little table with the books.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.440]   We have the sofa, we have the fireplace and we have the dining table.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.000]   Okay.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.960]   Five.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.000]   Uh, so I already can imagine your house very well, but that's also a
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.520]   cool thing about being a memory coach.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.160]   You always know how people live.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.400]   Um, so you enter your door, this is the first.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.840]   And now if you want to memorize something new, let's make a very easy
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.800]   example, the shopping list, classical example, but let's say you want to
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.040]   memorize five items or let's say, let's make it 10 because five is not so
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.360]   impressive, impressive.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.560]   Let's make it 10.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.600]   So first two items you want to buy, Chris, up to you.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.440]   We need some paper towels, paper towels, paper towels, and the second one.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.880]   Let's see, we need some, we need tea, chamomile tea.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.680]   Okay.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.560]   So the first step paper towels and tea, and now you connect these
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.400]   two items to your front door.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:03.440]   And you do that by creating a interesting, crazy story.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.120]   So for example, you come to your front door and there's a lot of tea
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.400]   over all over the place.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.320]   Maybe your daughter, I don't know, she did something with the tea on the
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.720]   front door and you would take your paper towels and you clean the door.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   Okay.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.440]   Okay.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.240]   First two tea and paper towels.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.320]   Next two items.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:19.800]   What is it?
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.960]   Let's see.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.840]   What else do we need?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.880]   Let's say we need some chicken and we need some sparkling water.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.120]   Sparkling water.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.480]   Okay.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.200]   Next location on your journey is the little table with the books, right?
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.760]   Yep.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.600]   Okay.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.520]   So imagine on this table, you just close your eyes and try to visualize that.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.320]   There is a chicken.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.920]   It can be a living chicken.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.280]   I mean, you will not buy a living chicken, but there's a living chicken.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.240]   What is the chicken doing?
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.720]   It's drinking sparkling water because it really likes sparkling water and says,
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.080]   Hey, Chris, this is a nice sparkling water.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.120]   Please don't kill me.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.920]   Something.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.360]   And, uh, you try to imagine that on the table of your daughter's book table.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:20:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.880]   And, uh, next location was, what was it?
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.760]   The sofa, right?
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.320]   Yep.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.080]   Okay.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.040]   Next two items.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.440]   Let's see.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.200]   We probably need some hot sauce and rice.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.120]   Hot sauce and rice.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.040]   You try to make a story with hot sauce, rice, and your sofa.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.920]   And it can be as crazy as I want, right?
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.680]   It can be as crazy as you want.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.120]   It can be silly, stupid, whatever.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.680]   So I I'm imagining that the sofa is covered in hot sauce and these little
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.200]   kernels of rice are jumping around like little people trying to avoid falling
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.440]   into and covering themselves in hot sauce.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.360]   Nice.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.560]   Nothing to add here.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.280]   It's perfect.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.080]   Okay.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.640]   Next is fireplace.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.480]   What do you want to buy?
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.400]   Two more items.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.800]   I just did grocery.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.040]   So I'm like, I don't need too many more.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.000]   We need some lettuce.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.480]   And let's say we need some, some dish soap for washing the dishes.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.240]   Okay.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.120]   Connect that to the fireplace.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.480]   Okay.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.640]   This one's less easy.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.760]   I'm imagining.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.240]   And, and I don't, I'm imagining an old man washing lettuce with soap
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.680]   and then throwing it into the fire.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.080]   So you have this soap.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.520]   Soap was the second thing, right?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.000]   There's like a soap in the water and we're washing lettuce before
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.880]   we throw it, before we throw it in the fire.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.520]   As long as you don't buy an old man and everything's fine.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.360]   So, and then on the table, last one, let's say two from my side, you buy
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.600]   bananas and you buy some chocolate.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.760]   So connect that to the dining table.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   I imagine just a chocolate fountain, just dipping the bananas in the
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.560]   chocolate fountain, like fondue and eating them.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.400]   It could be also your dining table is made out of chocolate and you can't
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   avoid biting into your table when you come home each and every time.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.720]   So it's almost gone already.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.480]   So chocolate and banana.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   And I'm pretty sure you can now call out all these 10 items.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.160]   Try that.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.400]   Let's go with door.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.080]   What was there?
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.640]   The door was paper towels and tea.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.400]   And then we went to the table and there is a, gosh, the chicken's
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.360]   telling me not to eat it.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.200]   And the chicken.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.760]   Oh, what is it?
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.600]   What is it doing?
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   I feel this is embarrassing.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.720]   The chicken.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.040]   Don't, don't, don't worry.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.400]   It's, it's, it's, it's drinking something.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.720]   Oh, the sparkling water.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.960]   Oh, the chicken's drinking.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.000]   I feel like that was the one where you, where you, you told the story.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.400]   I should have told the story myself.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.920]   Cause the next one, it's like, there's rice on the hot sauce.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.720]   It's obvious.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.000]   And then there's a soap and lettuce and bananas and chocolate.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   Nice.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.840]   10, 9 out of 10.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.160]   Okay.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.560]   But that's exactly what the point here.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.840]   If I tell you the story, it might be good or it might be not so good, but in the
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.480]   end, it's about your own visualization and then it's easy for you to memorize 10 items.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.520]   It's also possible for 20 and 30 and even for 50 or more.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.680]   And you can do that forward, backwards, any, any way you want it.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.240]   And that's such a cool technique, which not just works for shopping lists, of course,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.920]   but for actually for everything.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.280]   And that's also how I memorize a deck of cards with this memory palace method.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.080]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.040]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.160]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.120]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.360]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, 1.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.760]   37,000.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.280]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.680]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.200]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.560]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.760]   25.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.920]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.560]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.480]   in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.080]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.800]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.600]   companies I've run makes everything so much better.

[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.600]   N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.120]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.440]   actually so good for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.120]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.320]   ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.840]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.880]   leaves from 250-year-old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.720]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.040]   toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.520]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.160]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.560]   seconds, and are so travel friendly.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.800]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.480]   Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.640]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.280]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.920]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.240]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.640]   And then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.480]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.440]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.800]   free U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.480]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free Quiver with 12
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:03.840]   tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.320]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:15.200]   And is this the technique that, you know, most people use to, for all these
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.000]   disciplines and championships and all that?
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.880]   Everyone who is in this competition uses the Memory Palace technique
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.160]   in one or more disciplines.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.320]   I don't think there has ever been a world champion not using the Memory Palace.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.560]   That's the key technique for everyone who starts with memory
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.520]   sports or memory training.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.600]   So what you have here, what you need is a journey through your apartment,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.440]   like you did it here, and not just five locations, but even 10 or 20.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.160]   And then you can imagine if you just, this time we put two images on one
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.720]   location, but you can also put one on one location, then you have
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.840]   just five items in five locations.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.400]   Yeah, you have to try it for yourself, visualize everything,
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.800]   and then it works very well.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.720]   And you said these techniques have been around for a while.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   How old are they?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.800]   More than 2000 years.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.920]   Um, actually the first one who has written something about it was a Roman
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.960]   poet and he was writing it in his book, "De Oda Tore" around 2000 years ago.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.200]   And he used that to give free speeches.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.640]   So not free speeches, but yeah, speeches without notes.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.000]   So he was talking without notes and memorizing all the stuff he
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.400]   has to memorize for his speech.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.240]   And yeah, he described this technique for the first place in the first place.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.600]   But I think it's older because it's, I think it's just a natural thing.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.240]   To, to memorize things in locations.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.360]   For example, let's say 10,000 years back, I am pretty sure that people memorized
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.760]   where was the apple tree or where was the dangerous tiger living or something.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.720]   So people are connecting things to locations since they can think.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.440]   And what we do here is we using this mental, mental skill of the brain,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.080]   which is, which is there for, for other stuff and we do it on
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.640]   purpose, not just accidentally.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.120]   So what I think is interesting is a lot of sports, and I'm
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.880]   curious if, if memory is the same.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.480]   You know, the time it takes someone to run a mile or run a hundred meter dash
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.440]   has kind of gotten better and better and better over time is the ability of the
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.000]   world champion, you know, two, three years ago, better than 20 years ago.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.960]   And has memory similarly evolved?
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.120]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.160]   I'm not sure if memory per se evolved, but the, yeah, the, the
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.160]   results improved so much.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:53.960]   So the memorizing a deck of cards in under 30 seconds sounded crazy.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.600]   15 years ago, no one could do it.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.240]   And nowadays it's 12 seconds for a deck of cards.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.800]   And so the scores and the results tripled or even more within the
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.760]   last 20 years, and it's still going on.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:16.160]   And I'm really curious where it will go in the end, but also the, for example,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.840]   the record for five minute numbers, memorizing numbers for five minutes was
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.240]   333, 15 years ago, then it's 400.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.640]   Now, then it was 450, now it's 560.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.640]   So it's always a process of improving here.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.280]   And that's pretty cool to see things are still evolving.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.840]   But what's interesting is the technique hasn't evolved, right?
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.320]   It's just people are faster, but are they still using the same
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.200]   technique they used 15 years ago?
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.400]   And if so, why do you think people are getting better?
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.000]   So there are two things, I guess.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   So on the one hand, of course, people using the same techniques, the memory
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   palace technique, but people have some variations, like some people put one
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.840]   image on one location, two images, like we did, or even three.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.960]   So there are kind of variations, but that's not the reason why
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.120]   people are improving here.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.760]   I think the main reason is that the bar is higher nowadays.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.560]   15 years ago, the bar was like 333 digits in five minutes.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.120]   That was the holy grail.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.040]   That was super cool.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.520]   And you couldn't think that you can do it, but you trained
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.360]   very hard to get to that score.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.280]   Nowadays, the bar is 560.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.840]   So people start with a different point to look forward to.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:45.720]   So if you see 560 is possible, then you don't feel very good with 300 anymore.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.400]   You try to reach farther in the first place already.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.200]   And I think that's very important.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.880]   Knowing what is possible is a very important thing for people who start
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:01.760]   nowadays, because I see so many young athletes starting today and in half a
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.680]   year or in a year, they achieve results, which I trained 10 years for, because
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:12.960]   they are aiming for different heights when they start memory sports.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.560]   And that's the key here.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.760]   There's someone who has already achieved that.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.520]   So you say, "I can do that."
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:25.400]   Yeah, I think this reminds me of the Roger Bannister effect, which is the
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.680]   first person to break four minutes on the mile, and then it was something
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.280]   like the year after that, it's like almost everyone could do it.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.880]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.800]   So I have a few follow-ups on the memory palace.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.200]   You know, I went through this example with you.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.120]   I feel like now I could definitely get it right, especially
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.320]   even the sparkling water.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.560]   And I'll probably remember it in the morning as well, but how does it work?
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.480]   If you're doing multiple disciplines, do you use the same memory palace?
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.720]   And what happens if you're recycling that memory palace five,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   six, seven times in a few days?
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.800]   Does it all get mixed up or do you have a way to wipe it clean so you can start
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.240]   over or it just seems like it would be difficult to do it a lot of different
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.680]   times?
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.640]   So the first thing is that for such a memory competition, like a world
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.720]   championship, I not have just one memory palace.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:19.760]   You have now a part of a memory palace with five locations, but you could easily
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.240]   do like 30 or 50 in your house, I guess.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:28.520]   So I have not just five locations or 50, I have more than 2000 locations.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.960]   And that means a location is the door, a location is the table.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.560]   So I have 30 in my apartment.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.160]   I have 50 in my mother's apartment.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.760]   I have 100 in the university.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.560]   I have 150 in Japan, in a hotel when I was there.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.440]   I have some in San Diego.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.840]   I have some in Bahrain.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.920]   I have some in the UK.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.880]   I have some in the supermarket around the corner.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.120]   So I have memory palace all over the place.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.720]   So that means that I can use fresh memory palaces in a memory competition all over
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.240]   the place.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.880]   But you are right, things are there then.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.200]   So what happens in the next memory competition?
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.720]   And the trick is just not recalling or reviewing it.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.920]   So if you not review your shopping list for the next two weeks, you will forget
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.960]   it anyway.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.360]   If you review it every day, you will never forget it.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.120]   But if you don't review it, you will forget it.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:25.960]   And that's what I do.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.440]   I try to not review stuff what I memorized in a memory competition.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.880]   And then it's got just gone at some point.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:38.560]   And what I do in addition is I go through my memory palace and like going through
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.880]   it in an empty way, like just thinking of the door, just thinking of the table,
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.360]   thinking of the sofa without thinking of the actual image which I memorized.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.080]   That also helps.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.280]   So what technique are you using to kind of create, you know, let's take five
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.200]   minute numbers as an example, you're trying to remember a lot of numbers in a
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.360]   short period of time.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.640]   How do you place those numbers?
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.800]   Is it, do you come up with a letter for a number or an image for a number?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.440]   Or how does it work?
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   Yeah, actually it's a letter for a digit.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.960]   So the very basic example is the two.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.120]   If you look at the two, it looks like a swan.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.880]   Now look at the two, it looks a bit like a swan.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.320]   So a two could be a swan, but that's of course just a very basic example.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.760]   What I do is I have a letter like, or a number like three, and if I turn the
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.840]   three by 90 degrees, then it looks a little bit like an M, three is an M.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:42.200]   And so if I have a three and another three, then I would try to find a word
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.920]   by adding vowels in the middle or to the end.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.920]   So M and M, I would create the word mommy or mom.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.840]   So you have an M, you have a vowel, you have another M.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.520]   So the vowels are joker.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   You can use them for, at every place here.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:04.360]   So, and another example for the one is like a T, looks a little bit like a T, the one.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.720]   So you have T, one and three M.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.480]   What could you create out of 13?
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.200]   One, three.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.440]   What image could you create with a T and an M?
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.000]   Try to make a word here.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.080]   Time.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.040]   Time.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.720]   And how would I imagine time?
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.400]   Like a clock.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.800]   I would see a watch or a clock or a team would be also possible.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:31.520]   So when I have to memorize the number 33, then I imagine my mommy standing in
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.320]   front of the door, my mom standing in front of the door and on the table, there's a
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.440]   team fighting against each other.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.800]   So 13, 33, 30.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.840]   And that's what I do.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.560]   So I transform a two digit or even a three digit number in a image and I
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.760]   put that image on my location.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:56.640]   And yeah, what I did is really, I created the system with 1000 images.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.720]   So I have a fixed image for every three digit number.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.440]   So if you name a three digit number, I probably can name you the image for that.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.240]   Let's try 712.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.000]   That's in English.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.640]   It's a guillotine.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.440]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:20.120]   So in, in, in, in France, in the 18th century, if, when you get killed, you
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.600]   have to be, how do you call it guillotine?
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.240]   Yeah, guillotine.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.040]   Exactly.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.880]   That's a 712, a guillotine.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.840]   And that's because a seven is a seven, a G or kind of how?
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.520]   Yeah, it's a G and the one is a T and the two is an N.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.280]   They have guillotine.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.640]   Okay.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.600]   It's a good example.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.880]   So when you have a longer number that you have to memorize, is the process you go
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.080]   through, what's the first three numbers, convert it to this thing, which for you,
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.440]   because you have a database of a thousand or 999, you know, different numbers, you
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.640]   just immediately go guillotine, throw it in the first place of the memory palace.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.280]   Next three, throw it in the second, next three, throw it in the third.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.480]   Exactly.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.600]   If you train that very hard and very often you become faster and faster.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:14.520]   So I can do 500 in five minutes, 500 digits in five minutes, which means like
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.680]   167 transformations and putting it on a location.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.320]   And so for that, you'd be using kind of two different memory palaces
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.520]   going from one to the next.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:32.320]   If I, if I have 167 images, I need a memory palace with 167 locations.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.920]   Or if I have just one with 100, I start there and the other 67, I go to another
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.400]   one or even I put two images on a location.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.240]   So I have six digits on a location like we did here with two images.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.240]   Then I spare some locations.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.080]   I just need half of them, but that's the technical part.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.400]   And similarly for cards, how, how does that work?
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.520]   Yeah, actually the same.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.280]   I transform every card into an image.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:05.880]   And actually what I do is I transform every possible combination
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.240]   of two cards into one image.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:14.640]   So if you have two playing cards, there are 2,704 combinations possible.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.960]   And I have a unique image for every of these combinations.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.360]   And then I transform two cards into an image and put it on a location.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.480]   26 locations done.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:26.860]   Okay.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.520]   Okay.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.440]   So that makes sense.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.280]   I know one of the other disciplines that I didn't realize until I was kind
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.040]   of doing some research is on names and, you know, names are something that,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.440]   you know, I want to get to eventually after this about, you know, memorizing
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   them, but how do you, you know, numbers there's, there's a finite set of them.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.200]   Cards, there's a finite set, but, but new names, is there truly a finite
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.040]   set where you, you kind of have all of them or are you using a different
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.920]   technique to kind of memorize random names in, in that discipline?
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:02.360]   So names is actually the discipline or not even a discipline, but also in daily
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.400]   life where most people or many people struggle and in a competition, it's,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.880]   it's very hard because we have international names and there are Chinese
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.400]   names, Mongolian names and Russian names, a lot of different names from different
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.240]   countries, but, and that's quite tough because you have to be very creative
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:27.120]   and try to find an image for a very, very, yeah, unknown name for yourself.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   And that this is actually not a finite set.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.640]   There are unlimited names out there.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.440]   If you look on the international scale, but if you look just national names,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:44.480]   look up national names and you would check the 100 most used names in the
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.560]   US, then they repeat over and over again.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.320]   And of course there are names which are unique, but many names repeat.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.520]   And if you have an unique image for every, let's say the list of the 100
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.960]   most familiar male names and female names, and like Chris is a Christian,
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.800]   someone who was a Christian, who was praying all the time.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.440]   So imagine you, I would imagine you sitting here and praying before the
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.720]   interview because you want to do it right, you're a Chris Christian and you
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.680]   will meet a lot of Chris's in your life.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.080]   So you can memorize that.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.680]   And if you have a list of that, the most familiar, most common names,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.120]   that's what I'm searching for.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.320]   Then you have a huge advantage.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.240]   Just try to create an image for the most common names and then,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.640]   yeah, then you're ready to go.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.280]   And if it's getting more difficult, you need to be more creative.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.240]   Well, this, this is a perfect segue.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.680]   So I'm impressed at how quickly I remembered the list minus the water,
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.120]   you know, and now that I think about it, I'm like, wow, I could very easily
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.720]   walk through tea, paper towels, duck, water, rice, hot sauce, lettuce,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.960]   soap, bananas, chocolate.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.200]   Like it's so easy now.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.000]   But when I think about things that could practically improve my work or, or my
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.280]   personal or professional life, you know, a list is something that's, you know,
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.560]   pretty easy that I could just write down.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.320]   Obviously, if I don't have to, that's great.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.440]   And there are circumstances where I can't, but there are a lot of other
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.920]   things that I think, you know, are more practical things like
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.400]   remembering names at an event.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.320]   So maybe I could start there and, and kind of push on a few techniques that
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.200]   might be helpful for the kinds of memory exercises or skills that would be really
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.520]   helpful in our personal and professional lives.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.120]   And I guess names and faces is one of these things, because let's say you
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.480]   are going into a new job, to a new company, and they have to meet like
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.680]   30 new colleagues in the first day.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.560]   How cool would it be if you would be able to memorize all these
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.760]   names on the first day?
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.520]   I mean, you really make a different impression then, because if you memorize
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:00.360]   all these names, then, and you say, Hey, Chris, Hey, Andy, Hey, Maria, nice to
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.320]   meet you, then it's really a different story if you would do it like, Hey, you
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.880]   with the red shirt, what was your name again?
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.400]   So that gives you a social skill, which is very, very nice to have.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.680]   So the story here, or the technique here is what I really talked about
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.000]   already is like creating an image for many common names, like Chris, Maria
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.880]   is also a Christian image, like the mother Maria, but having something else.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:35.600]   Maybe you can name, you have a name on your mind, which I can give it a try on.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.240]   Chris.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.840]   I mean, it's funny you said Andy, which was actually the name of the first
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.720]   person I met at the company I work at.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.560]   And, and so would you just come up with an image that is unique to
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   that person or unique to the name?
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.520]   To the name, because you connect the image to the name then that's
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.400]   the second step, second step.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:00.000]   So what can you think of an image if you think of the name Andy?
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.320]   Yeah, what, what, what comes to mind for me is the, the Toy Story doll
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.920]   that has Andy written on the boot.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.000]   Nice.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.480]   Okay.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.160]   Now you have that doll and you need to connect that doll to
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.200]   the real Andy in your company.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.240]   So try to find something.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.960]   What is unique about this Andy in your company?
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:29.200]   Does he have the very big ears or always wearing nice shirts or a very deep voice?
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.160]   Something unique about that guy.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.640]   What is it?
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.360]   Yeah, I'm afraid he's going to be listening.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.680]   So I have to be careful here.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.320]   Maybe he has beautiful eyes or something.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.680]   I feel like I I've seen Andy wear a lot of sweaters, you know,
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.840]   he used to have longer hair.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.640]   He's, he's a little taller than most people.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.240]   Okay.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.440]   Longer hair is a nice one.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.920]   So you could try to imagine this little doll crawling through his hair.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:58.560]   So if you would see him next time, I, I'm pretty sure you
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.280]   cannot avoid thinking of that.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.680]   So this doll crawling through his hair.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.960]   So you would imagine, ah, this is Andy, the doll here.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.440]   And so this name, this man's name is Andy.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.360]   Of course, you know, know Andy already, but that's how it works.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.960]   So you try to find a unique feature.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.720]   On the person in the face or in the voice or whatever makes it this person unique.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.880]   And you connect your image from the name to that feature.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.520]   So if you, when you need, when you meet the person again, you see the feature
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.040]   and there is the name connected to that feature, actually a bit like the
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.720]   memory palace, because in the memory palace, you connect images to locations.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.560]   And here you put, you connect images to special features and persons,
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.120]   and that works pretty well.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:49.000]   So like Andy, I would have been a gun with any, and I would imagine, I'm
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.120]   not sure if you have seen this movie man in the moon, and I would imagine
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:46:00.840]   Andy Kaufman standing on the shoulder of this Andy, maybe making up his hair.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.040]   So that would be maybe my story.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.520]   And it's, it's a matter of training.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.920]   If you do it just once, it's like, okay, I cannot, if I meet five new
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.760]   people, how can I do that?
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.360]   I mean, I don't have the time.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.120]   It's like a hello, hello, hello.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.320]   And I am very occupied by you saying my all my own name five times.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.200]   But if you go into the situation and say, okay, I tried to memorize this name.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.280]   Then you just use the name.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.200]   Hi, Andy.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.960]   Nice to meet you.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.120]   And then you create your image afterwards.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.920]   So you don't have to do it on spot, but be just more aware of memorizing names.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.720]   That's the first step.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.280]   And the second step is using these memory techniques.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.440]   So it sounds like, you know, the advice I'd always heard is try to
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.000]   repeat the person's name a lot.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.760]   And it sounds like that's a good technique for the short term, but
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.080]   it probably doesn't last forever.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.960]   So you could use this to take that even further.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.040]   Yes.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.960]   And you use that for short term and then you take that name.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.320]   And when you left the situation, you just make your image
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.800]   because that lasts way longer.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:11.240]   So use that short term memory, but then go with and create a story, create an
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.720]   image, and that works pretty well for that.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.480]   And I mean, there's other stuff like talking without notes, going into
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.800]   an important negotiation, for example.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.760]   You want to talk about six important points and you don't want to look on
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.440]   your notes all over the place.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.320]   You want to be present and you want to talk without notes.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.960]   So you just memorize them.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.040]   And even giving a longer speech is possible with these techniques because
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.720]   you put your keynotes on your memory palace.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.400]   So you're going again with your memory palace and it's helpful in so many
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.360]   situations, not even, not just in exams.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:51.440]   And it's obvious having that in for school or your studies, but it's also
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.880]   helpful in daily life and in social situations where you have to come up
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.760]   with important points and you may be very nervous.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:05.800]   So you go into the job interview, you go into this negotiation by having all
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.720]   these keynotes in your head, in your memory palace, and you just have to walk
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.920]   through your memory palace being there in the job interview.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.520]   Don't close your eyes too often.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.080]   That works.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.000]   That looks a bit strange, but if you're a bit trained to that, that you are able
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.120]   and capable of doing that just on spot without any problems anymore.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.720]   So that was one that I actually had in my mind.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.400]   I was like, wow, today I had eight or 10 questions that I wanted to make
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.120]   sure I brought up in this interview.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.440]   I was like, wow, it'd be great if I could memorize them and not look at my notes.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.520]   How do you do that with kind of more abstract concepts?
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.800]   So if I wanted to ask a question about can you recycle a memory palace, I don't
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.400]   have a visual image like I did for a paper towel, or if I knew that I wanted
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.680]   to remind someone in a job interview about my experience spending a summer,
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:03.440]   you know, at a farm and maybe the farm has a better visual memory.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.400]   So maybe it's a, I just wanted to remind them that, you know, I'm really good at
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.320]   being punctual and on time and that kind of thing, when you have these abstract
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   things that aren't as visual, do you kind of convert them to objects or how do
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.760]   you, how do you memorize 10 points for a presentation?
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.720]   So the first thing is when you think about giving a presentation, what
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.840]   you do, let's say it's 10 points.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.640]   If you would write down notes, your notes would be awesome.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:37.120]   Maybe one, two or three images, three words, maybe not, not more because one,
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.160]   two or three words will remind you of the rest.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.560]   So what you actually have to memorize is not the sentence, but just the keynote,
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.280]   the keyword.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:52.200]   And for example, this question about recycling memory palaces could be a
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.320]   recycle bin, could be just a recycling something.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.160]   So you imagine yourself standing at your door, recycling something there.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:04.520]   And that word recycling would remind you of the rest or for even more abstract
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:09.880]   things like being on time that I would imagine that myself.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.720]   So I would create a memory palace with 10 locations.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.960]   And when I want to talk about the farm and next I want to talk about being on
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.000]   time on the first location, I would memorize the farm.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.920]   It's easy, just the farmer or the chicken, another chicken.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.760]   And then the second location I would memorizing being on time would memorize
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.160]   myself staying there, sitting there, looking at my watch and pointing on my
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.720]   watch, be on time.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   You have to be here.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:41.400]   Maybe telling that my girlfriend or someone else, you have to be here on time.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.760]   It's like imagine myself in this situation.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.360]   And that is also an image.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.160]   It's abstract, but it's an image.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.760]   Being on time is a feeling.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.480]   Trying to be being late is a feeling.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.320]   You feel bad.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.840]   You feel stressed.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.680]   It's a feeling.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.840]   And I try to memorize that feeling, being stressed on the couch, feeling I have to
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.800]   be on time sitting while I'm sitting on the couch, something in that direction.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.960]   It's not just an object you memorize.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.760]   It's also everything what surrounds that object.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.560]   It's not just the object itself.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.800]   It's a feeling.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.200]   It's a situation.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.040]   It's the, yeah, the embarrassment of being not on time.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.360]   That's what I memorize.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.920]   It reminds me of my rice and hot sauce example.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.080]   Like the more visceral it is of the feeling of the rice is being burned in the
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:33.880]   hot sauce and the more kind of extreme it can be, maybe makes it more memorable.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.400]   Exactly.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:41.160]   And, uh, it hasn't, doesn't has to be extreme every time, but it has to be
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.640]   something what works for you.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.720]   So if, if extreme works for you, go with that.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.920]   But if more, uh, causal works for you, go with that.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.800]   And if shiny works for you, go with shiny and it's up to you.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.320]   And does it work for things out of order?
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.880]   So, you know, when, if I'm trying to remember numbers, like you are in your,
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.280]   your, you know, your exercise for the competition, it's like, well, yeah, they
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.560]   have to be written down in order.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.760]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.640]   But, you know, if I was in a job interview and I knew there were seven or eight
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.000]   things that I really wanted to convey, the conversation is, is often led by the
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:17.680]   other person.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.400]   It might flow in a different path.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:25.680]   Is there some way to add, you know, a lack of order to memory, or is it just,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.080]   you know, every time I'm about to say something, I kind of run through the
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.640]   list, start to finish again, because I don't know if that makes sense.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.320]   So let's say you have like eight things you want to talk about.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.760]   And as you said, the conversation is running somewhere else.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.600]   And then you think there was something left.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.400]   Then if you're used to it, it's not difficult to go through your eight
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.760]   locations very fast, like in, in three or four seconds, just look for, ah, I
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   didn't talk about that.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.040]   I want to talk about that.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.320]   So you go through your list then.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.520]   And I think that's the, that's the story here.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.800]   Put it into the order on your memory pillars.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.720]   And if it's not too many, you just can go through it.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.680]   And if it's many, you can also go through it and maybe takes a bit more time, but
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.040]   actually you can find what is missing.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:14.000]   That's always, if we would have, if I would call out now like eight out of, out
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.240]   of these 10 items, you would be able to check which are missing by just going
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:24.360]   through your locations and thinking about what did he never mentioned and you would
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.200]   come up with that.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.320]   And that works pretty good.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:27.600]   It's funny.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.200]   As you answering this, I was thinking about the one, the list we made earlier.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.400]   And I was like, wow, I could go through that list so fast.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   So if anyone listening hasn't been trying to do this exercise on their own, I would
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.680]   strongly recommend maybe even pause, run through it yourself.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.360]   And I'm just surprised at how easily that list comes together, despite that I missed
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.240]   one in the first time.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.680]   But, but that's a, that's an experience where you, you have now, right?
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.200]   You, you have the feeling, wow, it works.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.000]   And you could go backwards too, doesn't matter, forwards, backwards, and you need
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.440]   to make this experience.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.240]   You need to do it by yourself because otherwise it's like, okay, he did that
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.920]   now, but I couldn't do it, but you will see it's so easy and it works so good.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.040]   And you reviewed that so often now.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.440]   I don't think that you will buy something else in the future anymore.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.200]   Always the same items now.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:26.440]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a great
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.240]   addition to your new year routine.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.840]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.560]   Trade is a subscription service.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.240]   We've been using for over a year that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.360]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.640]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy their
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:48.200]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:48.720]   coffee.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.560]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade, sign up for a subscription or
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.720]   try one of their starter packs today.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.160]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:00.360]   it.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.840]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade, but this
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe, it's called bark the moon
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.320]   and it's so delicious.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.920]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription right now, trade is
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.880]   offering a free bag with select subscription plans.

[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.480]   bag with select subscription plans, all the hacks.com/trade.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.360]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.520]   up your cooking at home?
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.000]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.400]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:49.240]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.280]   cookware from any day, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.200]   them for this episode.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:58.520]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.960]   scratch in the microwave.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.520]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.760]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.520]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.920]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.280]   too.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.520]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure, I highly
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.520]   recommend David Chang's salmon rice.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.000]   It is so good.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.760]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection, they launched last
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.080]   year.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.560]   You have to check it out.

[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.600]   This has been so interesting.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   How, how do you exercise all your brain for all this and practice?
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.120]   Is it just doing it over and over again, even if it's not part of something you
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.280]   actually need to memorize?
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.920]   Are there types of things you do to, to train or practice to, to get better at
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.280]   memory?
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:25.480]   Yeah, I think that's also a very important question because if you want to do it for,
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:32.440]   or use it for your daily life stuff, you can jump right in and try, but the best
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:37.560]   practice is to do training like you would do in memory sports.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:45.080]   So I don't go to the gym, but I have my memory sports gym at home, memorizing for
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:50.640]   memory sports, a list of words each day, or even 100 digits or something.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:56.640]   So what I really do in my workout is memorizing random stuff, random words,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:01.240]   random cards, random numbers, random names, and do that every day.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:07.240]   That's, that's a good step because continuing doing it every day on a daily
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.560]   basis, or at least five times a week, that's the key.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:16.040]   You can train once a month for three hours, or you train daily and training
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.600]   daily will give you a better result.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.440]   Like brushing your teeth, you wouldn't do it for two hours once a month, but
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.040]   daily, and that's the best result.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.320]   Are there, are there other things that help with this besides memory, like
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.800]   mindfulness training with meditation or breath work or anything like that?
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.280]   Definitely.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.760]   I mean, everything what helps you, what usually helps you in being not that
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:43.920]   stressed or more relaxed, just more relaxed or more aware of what is around
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.840]   you helps you.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:49.320]   So meditation is really a good thing to calm yourself down.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.720]   And that's what I told you before, before I start, I always have a one minute
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.640]   meditation to be more relaxed, to be in the memory mode.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:04.360]   And, but actually memorizing for one hour is a meditation itself.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.480]   Imagine that you, I mean, you're in your memory palace, you're just seeing
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.360]   images, you're putting them in a location in a rhythm, in a specific rhythm again.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:18.320]   And again, for one hour, it's kind of a huge meditation.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:23.120]   And you always feel your, that you, your thoughts are going somewhere else.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.120]   You have to bring them back to the exercise and that's meditation, isn't it?
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.920]   So, but yeah, everything, what helps you feeling better, being more relaxed,
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:37.880]   having a more mindful mind helps you also, of course, for being better
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.720]   at your memory skills.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.800]   Yeah, and do the benefits of all of this brain training, memory training
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:51.240]   translate to other skills like learning a language or anything like that?
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.160]   Yes.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.840]   I mean, for learning a language, you could also use memory techniques.
[00:59:54.840 --> 01:00:00.960]   Learning vocabulary is, that's, memory techniques is built for that somehow.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:06.000]   So learning vocabulary, for example, the world record for kids, we're learning a
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.680]   list of vocabulary in five minutes is 70 words in five minutes, 70 words in five
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.080]   minutes.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:19.920]   And so that's a side skill you have automatically if you train your memory.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.080]   But also what I said before is creativity.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.040]   Imagine you create these stories all over the place.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.640]   You become more creative.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:33.720]   You see connections where you don't see them usually because you are telling
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.360]   stories, you're creative, you use your fantasy.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:42.720]   So that's really also something what just happens on the side without really
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.240]   noticing it in the first place.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.280]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.440]   I'm like very excited to start applying a lot of these lessons, but I'm also
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.200]   curious for you, you do coaching.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.280]   Have you turned memory sports into a career and is this something that has
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.600]   become a profession for you?
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.520]   Do you win big prizes when you win championships or what's the state of
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.960]   memory as a profession?
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.440]   So memory sports is a profession as a profession.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.720]   I mean, over the last 16 years, I won two world championships and a lot of
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.440]   competitions.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.720]   And I think my overall earnings are like $50,000, which sounds good in the first
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.960]   place, but over 15 years, you cannot make a living out of that.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.680]   So prices are low.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.440]   It's really under the radar.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.160]   Not many people knowing about that.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.840]   So sometimes you just get a nice sweet box as a prize or something.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.640]   It's also nice, but getting chocolate doesn't help you paying your rent.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.840]   So it's not about being on the top of the memory sports ladder here, but it's
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.320]   about giving the coaching.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:55.200]   And I built my career on, of course, on my success in memory sports because that
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.920]   gives me the background.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.920]   Being a world champion is great and you know what you are talking about.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:06.800]   And now since a couple of years, I'm building this coaching, helping people
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.480]   for daily life issues, helping students, helping kids, but also, of course,
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.840]   business coaching for managers who want to manage their memory in a better way,
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.160]   memorizing all the clients or stuff like that.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.520]   So that's really something where you can build a pay your rent from, but not
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.760]   because of memory sports.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:27.840]   That's not possible.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.760]   I mean, you mentioned these events take place around the world.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.160]   So over 16 years, I have to imagine you might've spent as
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.840]   much as you've won in flights.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.680]   Yes.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.880]   And I am on the top, right?
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.840]   So people not being in the top five have no chance to pay their bills just for the
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.880]   flights because there is no prize money left.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.200]   The biggest prize money what I won once was $10,000 once and another time, 8,000.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.720]   So even these 50,000 are just seven or eight competitions combined.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.720]   Well, you could, you could tell all of the people not winning to check out a
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.960]   few episodes about points and miles.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.280]   Maybe they can learn to travel for free, which is a good segue into, you know, my
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.880]   last question, which is about other, other things outside of memory.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.240]   You've clearly been someone who's learned how to optimize and, and even hack their
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.160]   way to becoming kind of a world champion, not even kind of becoming a world
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.840]   champion twice, are there other aspects of your life where you've optimized
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.480]   things or you have unique tactics or routines that you use to upgrade the way
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:32.960]   you live?
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.760]   I tried a lot of things.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.000]   One thing what I tried and which worked very well for quite a
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.120]   while was gamification of my life.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.200]   So like having my own coin system, point system.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:52.760]   So I was putting everything into this app and I was getting points for checking my
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.320]   emails.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.440]   I was getting points for making this call to the dentist.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.280]   I was getting points for having this new client.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.440]   So for all things in my life.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.040]   And then I rewarded myself when I get collected 100 points, I get something.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.360]   So that worked pretty well actually.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:20.560]   But at one point I was just creating tasks for my points scale and that was not going
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.480]   anywhere anymore.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.200]   So I skipped that, but it was working for a while.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:30.040]   And nowadays I'm using like, yeah, co-operative management tools, like you,
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.120]   what you use sometimes in companies.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.920]   I use that for myself, for my different projects because I have so many different
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.080]   projects and it's good to have an overview about everything.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.840]   So there's a big mind map included.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.080]   I see everything on one page, but everything is also splitted.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:52.360]   So, specific tasks for specific days, that's one thing what I can recommend.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.480]   So if you have three projects, don't try to do all the project in one day, focus on
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.800]   one project each day.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.840]   That also helps me.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:07.480]   So yeah, managing my stuff and my things with these apps, there are plenty of them
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:07.960]   out there.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:13.240]   This is really helpful for me and yeah, helps me to structure my life and my
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.080]   projects.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.680]   And are there specific apps that you like that people can try out?
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.000]   Yeah, of course, ClickUp is one of these apps.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.520]   I'm not sure if you know that, but it's pretty nice.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.440]   It's amazing.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:29.560]   It connects your Google calendar with your ClickUp and you have everything in one
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.320]   place and you can integrate Zoom and everything.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.760]   So I'm not sponsored by that, but I can recommend it anyway.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.520]   So ClickUp, if you hear me, please get in touch.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.960]   Yeah, that would be great.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.240]   Are there other apps or services online or videos that you think people should check
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.960]   out to practice memory or to learn more?
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:59.040]   For memory, Anki is a very, very helpful app to learn your own stuff.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.400]   You can put in your own stuff you want to learn and you can use this Anki method,
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.720]   which is actually a review method.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.080]   Memorizing stuff is not just about memorizing it, but also about reviewing.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.640]   And some stuff you have to review more often, some less.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.520]   And this app helps you here.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.800]   That's really cool.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.960]   And of course, if you want to learn something about or want to check out
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.280]   Memory Sports, you can watch my Twitch channel where I usually do commentary on
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.680]   Memory Sports matches.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.120]   And that's a really cool thing.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:37.080]   It's a small channel still, but yeah, you will meet all the great memories, people
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.200]   around the world on that channel and can recommend that.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.520]   That's awesome.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.120]   Yeah, I mean, that's the reason if you're watching the video, you'll see Johannes
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.440]   has a green screen and I'm sure that's what it's for.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.440]   Any other places that people should find you online or learn about what you're
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:51.840]   working on?
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.080]   Yeah, so my Memory Sports TV is the name of my Twitch channel, but also my website
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.840]   Johannes-Malo.com.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.520]   You can get in touch with me and to learn something about it.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.800]   Yeah, so that's Johannes-Malo.com.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.880]   I just want to make sure you get it.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.560]   But the links to all that's in the show notes.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.720]   And just last quick question on coaching.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.680]   Is that something you offer to anyone that people listening who want to improve
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.800]   memory and their work or their personal life can get in touch?
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   Yes, definitely get in touch.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.000]   And then usually I have a talk with people because I really want to help them
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.640]   and I want to figure out, can I help you or not?
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.040]   That's the most important part.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.600]   But if I can help you, then everyone can get in touch with me and let's see what
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.040]   we can do.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.400]   That sounds great.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.720]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.760]   This was fantastic.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.520]   Thank you, Chris, for inviting me.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.800]   And yeah, it was a nice show and I hope you will not forget your shopping list and
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.760]   maybe extend that for the next time.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.480]   I will do my best.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:51.880]   Thank you.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.160]   Good.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.120]   Thanks.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.240]   What a fantastic conversation.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.120]   I'm even recording this outro three days later because I wanted to see if I still
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.080]   remembered the list.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.800]   Paper towels, tea, chicken, sparkling water, rice, hot sauce, lettuce, soap,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.000]   chocolate, bananas.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:09.440]   Boom.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.920]   And I haven't even practiced at all since our conversation.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.360]   So these techniques really work.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.520]   I hope that for everyone listening, you get similar success and you have fun
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.520]   practicing this.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.880]   And with a little practice, I'm hoping I can get this whole system down even
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.440]   faster.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.800]   I'm going to be planning another Q&A episode soon, so please send over any
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.440]   questions you have for me or really any thoughts or feedback, too.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.160]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com and it's Thanksgiving in the US tomorrow.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.520]   So everyone out there who's subscribed to the show, who's written me an email,
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.160]   posted a review online, shared the show with friends or anything else to support
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.200]   me and AllTheHacks, thank you so much.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:53.320]   I am so grateful for all of you and I'm so excited for everything we have coming
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.040]   down the road.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.880]   Finally, for those of you celebrating Thanksgiving, have a wonderful time.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.200]   Hopefully you're getting to spend it with friends and family.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.720]   That's it for this week.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.800]   See you all next week.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:21.400]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:21.800]   money.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.560]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.720]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.560]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.680]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.920]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.240]   world can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:44.960]   entertaining.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:50.480]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.640]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.560]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.200]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.840]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.800]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.600]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.040]   your money and grow your wealth.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.200]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.600]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.080]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
