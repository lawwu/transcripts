[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:11.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.800]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.960]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.320]   Today's conversation is one I am certain you'll remember
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.040]   because it is all about memory.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.320]   I'm joined by Johannes Malo, who stumbled on memory sports in 2003
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.480]   after watching a TV talent show and has since been crowned
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.160]   World Memory Champion twice, most recently in 2018, and has won the
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.440]   German Memory Championship four times.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.600]   He's competed all over the world for the past 18 years and is currently
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.760]   ranked number nine in the world by the International Association of Memory.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.720]   Some of his personal records include memorizing a random list of
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.600]   1,014 numbers in 15 minutes and memorizing the order of a randomly
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.320]   shuffled deck of cards in under 25 seconds.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.920]   In our conversation, we'll hear about the mental and physical
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.480]   struggles Johannes had to overcome to be a world champion.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.680]   We'll learn about the techniques he uses to memorize things most
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.120]   of us assume are impossible.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.360]   And we'll discuss how we can use these techniques for things in our
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.760]   personal and professional life.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.360]   I am so excited for this episode, so let's jump in.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   Johannes, thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.360]   Chris, thank you very much for having me.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.400]   And yeah, looking forward to that today.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.320]   And for your questions.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.160]   So, you know, I mentioned a couple of the records you hold, but I don't
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.840]   think most people know what a World Memory Championship even is.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.280]   So I thought it might be good to start.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.160]   What is it?
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.760]   What happens at these events and what kinds of things have you accomplished
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.280]   to be crowned the champion?
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.640]   So in general, a World Championship is a three days event happening
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.240]   somewhere in the world, and usually it's like a big exam, so a huge exam.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.800]   Hundreds of people sitting down at their desk and they will be given a sheet of
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.200]   paper with, for example, numbers or names or words, and then they have a specific
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000]   amount of time to memorize these lists.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.760]   So for example, there's one discipline out of 10, which you mentioned
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.320]   is, for example, 15 minute numbers.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.000]   So you have a sheet of paper with digits on it, and you have 15 minutes to
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.360]   memorize as many as you can, and then they collect these sheets of paper and
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.880]   then you get a recall sheet and you have to write them down.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.920]   So, and that is just one discipline out of 10 for the World Championship,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.520]   and it's spread out over three days.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.560]   For example, one discipline is one hour numbers.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.040]   So you have to memorize for one hour as many digits as you can, or one hour cards.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.840]   So you have to memorize playing cards as many as you can within one hour.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.680]   And that is really exhausting.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.720]   So it's unbelievably exhausting actually.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   So that's actually what a World Memory Championship works like 10 disciplines,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.720]   names, cards, numbers, and so on.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.960]   And in the end, overall, you get points for each discipline and the overall
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.160]   champion is the one with the most points over all the disciplines.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.960]   And that I became twice in 2018 and 2012, having the most points out of these
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.680]   10 disciplines in the World Championship.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.640]   Is there one discipline that's kind of known within all of the competitors
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.240]   that is the hardest one that, you know, whoever can win this one
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.520]   is likely to be the champion?
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   Actually, I think the last one, this is called Speed Cards.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   This is the most exciting stuff.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.360]   And it's, you have an actual deck of cards, 52 playing cards, and it is shuffled.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.120]   And then you have to memorize it as fast as you can in the correct order,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.960]   all the cards, the 52 cards.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   And then when you're done, you put it away and you get a second deck of cards,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.080]   which is in the correct order of the cards.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.800]   And then you have to put this ordered deck of cards into the order of the
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.240]   shuffled deck of cards, which you just memorized.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.400]   And the crucial thing here is that this is the last discipline.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.160]   And if you make one mistake, like just swap two cards, for example, then you
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.800]   just get zero points for that deck.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.520]   And that's the toughest thing because you can't really make a mistake.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.480]   Otherwise you just get zero points instead of 800 and then you lose the
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.000]   championship.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.720]   And so the pressure is on.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.080]   You need to do that right now.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.320]   And everyone is watching.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.240]   And yeah, you have to memorize a deck of cards, maybe in 30 seconds, 25, 20
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.720]   seconds.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.680]   This is what we are up to today in the World of Memory competition, 20 seconds.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.400]   The world record is actually 12.76 seconds for memorizing a deck of cards
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   with 52 playing cards.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.040]   I have so many questions about how you do it, how you feel.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.240]   But when you're in that final moment of competing in the last discipline, are
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.880]   there things you do to prepare yourself?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.800]   Yes, I try to relax.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.120]   Easier said than done.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.120]   But actually I try to imagine myself being at home again, being at my desk at
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.760]   home in a training situation.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.440]   So I close my eyes.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.040]   I imagine myself being at home at my training desk and just hearing the
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.160]   sound, what I hear usually in my home, feeling the desk and so on.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.560]   So like bringing me back in this relaxing situation and that calms me down and my
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.320]   heart rate drops and I become more relaxed.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.520]   So it's like a small meditation, you might call it like that.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.240]   And this works pretty well for me.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.160]   Breathe slowly in, slowly out, just for a minute and then I'm ready to go.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.720]   Wow.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.480]   So if anyone listening wants to see some of these competitions, there's lots of
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.960]   videos online and I highly recommend looking it up.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's really kind of exciting to watch someone memorize this deck of cards so
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.240]   quickly.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.720]   Is this something you always knew you would do or how did you get into this, I
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   guess, career of memory sports?
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.520]   My mother would say I was always into memorizing because I always beat my
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.920]   parents in memory playing cards when I was a child.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.000]   But of course, every child is beating their parents in playing memory.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.320]   So I wasn't into that in any way before I finished school.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:26.280]   And when I turned 22 and went to my studies, then I just came across this
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.600]   memory sports, like you told before, I saw this talent show on the TV and
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   someone memorized the deck of cards and the list of words and I was like, okay,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.320]   if she can do it, I can do it too.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.800]   And then I went to the internet, did some research.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.120]   So I started in my early twenties with that, and then I somehow got addicted
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.200]   to doing that again and again and again, because I saw myself climbing up the
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   ladder of rankings and that was really motivating for me.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.840]   So at first it was just a competition thing.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.080]   And then later I started doing also memory for my studies.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.760]   And then at another point I started training kids in how to learn better for
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.160]   school, but also doing just memory competitions.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.800]   So yeah, it's, it's all like right now since 18 years I'm doing that.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.720]   Wow.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.280]   And I know you mentioned on your website, the physical issues you faced played a
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.520]   big role in kind of pushing you to do this.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.120]   Could you talk a little bit about that journey?
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.320]   Sure, sure.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   A little, it's not easy to talk just a little about it because it's a longer
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.080]   story, but I'm facing a physical muscle disease.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.880]   That means that my muscles are going down and this disease is called FSHD and it's
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.640]   also very well known in the US, there's a big organization about it.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.800]   So I was facing that when I turned 14 already, and then it started with my legs.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.520]   So my left leg becomes thinner and thinner and the muscles decrease there.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.760]   And I was falling down to the floor and I couldn't go and play table tennis anymore.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.480]   I was quite okay, good table tennis player and I couldn't do that anymore.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.400]   So it was a slight start.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.560]   And then I went to the hospital and they tried to find out what is it about?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.360]   And then they found, okay, this is a genetic disease, which affects my
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.960]   muscles and they will go down over time, but they couldn't say how long it will
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.840]   take to maybe do I have to use a wheelchair or not and so on, and then I
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.480]   just tried to forget about that because you are 15, 16, you try to, I don't know,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.640]   you try to go to a party or get a girlfriend or whatever, but, and I don't
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.840]   just don't want to, didn't want to, yeah, be too much involved into that.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.800]   So I didn't do anything about it at this point because I couldn't do anything.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.040]   And then I went 10, when I turned 20, 21, 22, it was the time that I had a hard
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.240]   time walking and it becomes more difficult.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.000]   And in my twenties, I was very depressed about that because it was like aging
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.560]   early, it really felt like I was already 70 years old or 80 years old and
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.200]   everything goes down with my body.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.160]   And I felt bad about it.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.080]   I was depressed.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.760]   My self-confidence goes down, but then there was memory sports and memory
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.160]   sports was my door into another world because that gave me the opportunity to
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   travel the world, to meet other people who are also interested in this memory
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.840]   stuff and most important to compete against others because I was always very
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   competitive, but with this muscle disease, you couldn't do any competitive
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.680]   sport anymore, but memory sports was possible.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.840]   And then I thought, okay, I can try to be the German champion.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.000]   And then I won that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.040]   And then I was like, okay, maybe I can be the world champion once.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.680]   And I tried my best and finished second and finished second again in the world
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.280]   championship.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.800]   And I was depressed about that.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.400]   Actually second in the world is quite good, but I was depressed anyway.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:08.600]   And, but because I was not accepting my disease at this point, then I went to a
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.040]   doctor, a psychologist, and she helped me a lot.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.680]   And then at some point I had to say, okay, I have to use a wheelchair.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.240]   If I want to be a world champion, I have to travel there.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.760]   And if I want to travel there, I cannot walk anymore.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.560]   It's too tough.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.960]   I fall down to this floor all the time.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   It's so dangerous and then have to decide, okay, I take a wheelchair now, go to the
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.520]   world championship and try to win it.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.800]   And actually that was one of the most important steps back then to just accept
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.280]   it, use a wheelchair, and now the wheelchair means freedom for me.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.840]   And that moment becoming the world champion in 2012 was the best moment in my
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.200]   life, I would say, because I went through so much trouble, 10 years of depression
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:56.360]   and being down and fighting this disease and fighting myself and trying to be the
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.000]   best in the world and failing.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.280]   And then sitting there in the last discipline, speed karts, sitting there and
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.600]   say, okay, now you have to memorize the stack in about 40 seconds.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.120]   That's enough this time.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   Just do it.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.560]   And I failed the first attempt.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.320]   And then I had one attempt left.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.160]   You have two attempts.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.400]   And I was like, okay, now everything counts.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.520]   Now it's this moment.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.880]   Everything comes together here.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.400]   And then I did it somehow.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.160]   I was shaking, but I did it.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.640]   And then I was a world champion.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.600]   And that was really like, yeah, it was a huge emotional moment for me.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.920]   Thank you for kind of opening up and sharing things that people don't often
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.560]   talk about.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.680]   Are there things that if you look back, you think steps along the way that helped
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.760]   you push through the really hard parts of that journey?
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.320]   When I think back, it's obviously that friends, good friends are very important.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.840]   So because if you can rely on, even if it's just one person you can rely on and
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.880]   you can talk to, that's very, very important in these situations.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.000]   And that's one point.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.440]   And the other point was taking professional help here.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.200]   So going to the psychologist was very, very important for me.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.640]   And sometimes you try to do it by yourself and I tried for years, but getting help
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.200]   from outside was the key to survive here.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.120]   And do you think, obviously you said you started getting into memory without any
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.880]   intention of it.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.920]   You saw it on TV.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   Do you think, you know, a gifted memory like yours is something that can be
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.600]   trained and needs natural talent?
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.000]   Or do you think it's something that anyone can do and learn on their own?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.600]   And yeah, that's a good point because people always think, "Oh, this is a highly
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.080]   gifted guy, talented, and we're always doing it since we were a kid."
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.840]   It's not true because I always start learning that.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.000]   And of course, I think if you want to go to the top 10 in the world or you want to
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.800]   be the world champion, I guess there is some talent involved for that because
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   otherwise everyone could be a world champion.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.840]   But for increasing your own memory skills by using memory techniques, that's
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.280]   something everyone can do and everyone can have a huge, huge boost for their own
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.480]   memories with these techniques.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.600]   Not everyone can run 100 meters in under 10 seconds, but if you try hard, you
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.760]   maybe can beat 12 or 13 seconds.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.680]   So that's the same about memory.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.360]   You found this thing at age 19, you weren't even thinking about really in any
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.840]   professional way, and then you stumbled on it and then you were world champion.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.240]   Are there other things that you think you now realize maybe you'd be the best poker
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:50.000]   player in the world and has that led you to explore new disciplines or skills that
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.600]   you might have and you didn't know about?
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.280]   You try things.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.640]   If you have this skill, these memory skills, on poker it doesn't work because
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.920]   you always get new cards and I mean, memorizing two cards should be possible
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.800]   for everyone, but of course, I was thinking about beating Blackjack, memorizing
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:16.480]   these cards, a sequence of cards that are out there and such stuff, but I mean,
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.400]   I'm not rich, so it didn't work so well because casinos really take care of
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.480]   changing the deck of cards nowadays.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.040]   So they change the deck of cards and then you don't have any advantage anymore.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.480]   But on the other hand, what one thing would really increase for myself, which
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.560]   I realized not in the first place, but later is my creativity, because when you
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.720]   train your memory, it's all about strategies and these strategies involve
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.000]   creating visual images, connecting stuff to each other, which is not related to
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.640]   each other and doing that over and over again, it looks like that my creativity
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   really increased a lot because sometimes I see connections where no one else sees
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.920]   the connection and that really helps me in my business, daily life and in
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.200]   brainstorming sessions.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.040]   So yeah, this is really one thing that improved a lot here.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   That's awesome.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.560]   I want to dig into how you do that kind of exercise in practice, but before, I
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.920]   thought it might be really helpful.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.200]   Maybe you could walk me through an example of what it looks like to actually
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.320]   use a memory technique to memorize something and we can kind of explore that
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.760]   together.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.280]   Okay, let's do that.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.480]   So the most popular memory technique is the memory palace.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.240]   Maybe you have heard about it.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:45.400]   It's also in some pop culture, like Sherlock Holmes is using the memory palace.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:52.560]   So the memory palace is more than 2000 years old and this is a technique where
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.520]   you walk or you have a mental walk, for example, through your apartment or house.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.840]   So imagine yourself standing in the front of your door.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.560]   So that's the first location.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.720]   You say, okay, door is the first location and then you enter your apartment and
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   then what comes to the left?
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.600]   What is there for you, Chris?
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.720]   What is on the left when you come into your apartment?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.520]   When I walk in the door on the left is the living room.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.720]   The living room.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.040]   Okay.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.000]   So you enter the living room and what's there?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.480]   Is there any furniture?
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Is it a TV or a chair or what is it?
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.200]   There's two sofas and a coffee table.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.040]   Okay.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.840]   So, and the trick is to do it in a specific direction.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   So I entered my apartment and to the left, there is a wardrobe and then I
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.760]   pass the wardrobe and I go to the left.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.600]   There's my bathroom.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.960]   And there is the first thing is the laundry machine.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.240]   And then I go around the room, like going clockwise through my room.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.280]   So that's what I do.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.920]   And what would happen with you if you do that?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.560]   So you enter your room and then what comes to the left?
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.320]   Try to go clockwise through your living room here.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.440]   Door is number one.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.080]   And then what comes if you go clockwise through your living room?
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.320]   If I go clockwise, there's a, my daughter has a little table that she has all
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.120]   her little books on is the first thing.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.160]   Then there's a couch, then there's a fireplace.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.600]   And then, then it's kind of all connected in one room to the dining room.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.640]   So there's a big dining room table.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.000]   And then that actually connects to the kitchen.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.320]   So there's a island in the kitchen with a sink and, and the
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.480]   fridge is over there and the stove.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.280]   Let's, let's start with these.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.000]   So we have front door, we have the table with the books.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.960]   We have the sofa, we have the fireplace and we have the dining table.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.560]   Okay.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.480]   Five.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.720]   So I already can imagine your house very well, but that's also a cool
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.080]   thing about being a memory coach.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.680]   You always know how people live.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.920]   So you enter your door, this is the first.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.360]   And now if you want to memorize something new, let's make a very easy
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.320]   example, the shopping list, classical example, but let's say you want to
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.560]   memorize five items or let's say, let's make it 10 because five is not so
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.080]   impressive, impressive, let's make it 10.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.120]   So first two items you want to buy, Chris, up to you.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.240]   We need some paper towels, paper towels, paper towels.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.400]   And the second one, let's see, we need some, we need tea, chamomile tea.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.160]   Okay.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.200]   So the first are paper towels and tea.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.280]   And now you connect these two items to your front door and you do that by
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.000]   creating a interesting, crazy story.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.400]   So for example, you come to your front door and there's a lot of
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.960]   tea over all over the place.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.320]   Maybe your daughter, I don't know.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.600]   She did something with the tea on the front door and you would take your
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.280]   paper towels and you clean the door.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   Okay.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.000]   Okay.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.800]   First two, tea and paper towels.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.880]   Next two items.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.360]   What is it?
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.480]   Let's see.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.360]   What else do we need?
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   Let's say we need some chicken.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.480]   Chicken.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.440]   And we need some sparkling water.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.680]   Sparkling water.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.040]   Okay.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.720]   Next location on your journey is the little table with the books, right?
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.280]   Yep.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.120]   Okay.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.040]   So imagine on this table, you just close your eyes and try to visualize that.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.840]   There is a chicken.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.440]   It can be a living chicken.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.760]   I mean, you will not buy a living chicken, but there's a living chicken.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   What is the chicken doing?
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.240]   It's drinking sparkling water because it really likes sparkling water and says,
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.560]   Hey, Chris, this is a nice sparkling water.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.600]   Please don't kill me.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.400]   Something.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.920]   And, uh, you try to imagine that on the table of your daughter's book table.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.440]   And, uh, next location was, what was it?
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.320]   The sofa, right?
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:30.840]   Yep.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.640]   Okay.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.600]   Next two items.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.000]   Let's see.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.760]   We probably need some hot sauce and rice.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.680]   Hot sauce and rice.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.600]   You try to make a story with hot sauce, rice, and your sofa.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.480]   And it can be as crazy as I want, right?
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.240]   It can be as crazy as you want.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.680]   It can be silly, stupid, whatever.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.240]   So I I'm imagining that the sofa is covered in hot sauce and these little
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.760]   kernels of rice are jumping around like little people trying to avoid falling
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.000]   into and covering themselves in hot sauce.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.960]   Nice.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.120]   Nothing to add here.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.840]   It's perfect.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.640]   Okay.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.200]   Next is fireplace.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.040]   What do you want to buy?
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.960]   Two more items?
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.360]   Just did grocery.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.600]   So I'm like, I don't need too many more.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.720]   We need some lettuce and let's say we need some, some dish
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.040]   soap for washing the dishes.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.800]   Okay.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.640]   Connect that to the fireplace.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.040]   Okay.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.200]   This one's less easy.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.280]   I'm imagining.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.800]   And, and I don't, I'm imagining an old man washing lettuce with soap
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.200]   and then throwing it into the fire.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.040]   So you have this soap, soap was the second thing, right?
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.560]   There's like a soap in the water and we're washing lettuce before
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.400]   we throw it, before we throw it in the fire.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.080]   As long as you don't buy an old man and everything's fine.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.920]   So, and then on the table, last one, let's say two from my side, you buy
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.160]   bananas and you buy some chocolate.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.320]   So connect that to the dining table.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   I imagine just a chocolate fountain, just dipping the bananas in the
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.120]   chocolate fountain, like fondue and eating them.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.960]   It could be also your dining table is made out of chocolate and you can't
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   avoid biting into your table when you come home each and every time.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.280]   So it's almost gone already.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.040]   So chocolate and banana.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   And I'm pretty sure you can now call out all these 10 items.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.720]   Try that.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.960]   Let's go with door.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.640]   What was there?
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.200]   The door was paper towels and tea.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.960]   And then we went to the table and there is a, gosh, the chicken's
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.760]   telling me not to eat it and the chicken.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.320]   Oh, what is it?
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   What is it doing?
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.960]   Oh, I feel terrible.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.160]   This is embarrassing.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.320]   The chicken.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.600]   Don't, don't, don't worry.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.920]   It's, it's, it's, it's drinking something.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.240]   Oh, the sparkling water.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.520]   Oh, the chicken's drinking.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.520]   I feel like that was the one where you, where you, you told the story.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.000]   I should have told the story myself because the next one, it's like
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.440]   there's rice on the hot sauce.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.240]   It's obvious.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.520]   Then there's a soap and lettuce and bananas and chocolate.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.080]   Nice.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.360]   10, 9 out of 10.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.720]   Okay.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.080]   But that's exactly what the point here.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.160]   If I tell you the story, it might be good or it might be not so good, but
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.600]   in the end, it's about your own visualization and then it's easy
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.000]   for you to memorize 10 items.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.040]   It's also possible for 20 and 30 and even for 50 or more.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.200]   And you can do that forward, backwards, any, any way you want it.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.440]   And that's such a cool technique, which not just works for shopping lists, of
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   course, but for actually for everything.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.800]   And that's also how I memorize the deck, of course, with this memory palace method.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.760]   Getting the crew together.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.320]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.040]   I get it.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.320]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.640]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.720]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.160]   go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.200]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.040]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.440]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.840]   want to celebrate that you got through another week with Drizzly.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.080]   You can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.560]   means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.040]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.720]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.080]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.920]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.720]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.640]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.000]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.200]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.000]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.080]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.360]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.200]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.760]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.600]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.160]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.320]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.040]   investments.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.360]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.520]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.720]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.520]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.320]   opportunities.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.560]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.960]   you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.160]   everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's education, to finding
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.360]   a concierge doctor.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.280]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.960]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.440]   for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle, and it's totally free to
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:05.880]   join.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.240]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.080]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.760]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.520]   And is this the technique that, you know, most people use to, for all these
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.320]   disciplines and championships and all that?
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:33.120]   Everyone who is in this competition uses the memory palace technique in one or more
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.840]   disciplines.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.000]   I don't think there has ever been a world champion not using the memory palace.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.680]   That's the key technique for everyone who starts with memory sports or memory
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.200]   training.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.560]   So what you have here, what you need is a journey through your apartment, like you
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.120]   did it here, and not just five locations, but even 10 or 20.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.880]   And then you can imagine if you just, this time we put two images on one
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.040]   location, but you can also put one on one location.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.560]   Then you have just five items in five locations.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.880]   Yeah, you have to try it for yourself, visualize everything, and then it works
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.480]   very well.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.440]   And you said these techniques have been around for a while.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.360]   How old are they?
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.520]   More than 2,000 years.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.560]   Actually, the first one who has written something about it was a Roman poet, and
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.720]   he was writing it in his book, De Oda Tore, around 2,000 years ago.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.960]   And he used that to give free speeches.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.360]   So not free speeches, but yeah, speeches without notes.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:38.040]   So he was talking without notes and memorizing all the stuff he has to
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.120]   memorize for his speech.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.480]   And yeah, he described this technique in the first place, but I think it's older
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:53.000]   because I think it's just a natural thing to memorize things in locations.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.120]   For example, let's say 10,000 years back, I am pretty sure that people memorized
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:05.480]   where was the apple tree or where was the dangerous tiger living or something.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.440]   So people are connecting things to locations since they can think.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:16.880]   And what we do here is we're using this mental skill of the brain, which is
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.400]   there for other stuff, and we do it on purpose, not just accidentally.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.200]   So what I think is interesting is a lot of sports, and I'm curious if memory is
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.640]   the same, you know, the time it takes someone to run a mile or run a hundred
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.080]   meter dash has kind of gotten better and better and better over time.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.680]   Is the ability of the world champion, you know, two, three years ago, better
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.720]   than 20 years ago, and has memory similarly evolved?
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.400]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   I'm not sure if memory per se involved, but the results improved so much.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:03.600]   So the memorizing a deck of cards in under 30 seconds sounded crazy 15 years ago.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.520]   No one could do it, and nowadays it's 12 seconds for a deck of cards.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:15.600]   And so the scores and the results tripled or even more within the last 20 years.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.360]   And it's still going on, and I'm really curious where it will go in the end.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.720]   But also the, for example, the record for five minute numbers, memorizing
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.480]   numbers for five minutes was 333 15 years ago, then it's 400.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.880]   Now then it was 450, now it's 560.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   So it's always a process of improving here.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.520]   And that's pretty cool to see things are still evolving.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   But what's interesting is the technique hasn't evolved, right?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.000]   It's just people are faster, but are they still using the same
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.880]   technique they used 15 years ago?
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.080]   And if so, why do you think people are getting better?
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.680]   So there are two things, I guess.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.360]   So on the one hand, of course, people using the same techniques, the memory
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.880]   palace technique, but people have some variations, like some people put one
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.520]   image on one location, two images like we did, or even three.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.680]   So there are kind of variations, but that's not the reason why
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.840]   people are improving here.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.480]   I think the main reason is that the bar is higher nowadays.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.240]   15 years ago, the bar was like 333 digits in five minutes.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.800]   That was a holy grail.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.720]   That was super cool.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.200]   And you couldn't think that you can do it, but you trained
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.080]   very hard to get to that score.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.960]   Nowadays, the bar is 560.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.520]   So people start with a different point to look forward to.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:53.400]   So if you see 560 is possible, then you don't feel very good with 300 anymore.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.120]   You try to reach farther in the first place already.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.920]   And I think that's very important.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.600]   Knowing what is possible is a very important thing for people who start
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.480]   nowadays, because I see so many young athletes starting today and in half a
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.440]   year and in a year, they achieve results, which I trained 10 years for, because
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:20.680]   they are aiming for different heights when they start memory sports.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.320]   And that's the key here.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.480]   There's someone who has already achieved that.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.240]   So you say, I can do that.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:33.360]   Yeah, I think it reminds me of the Roger Bannister effect, which is the first
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.960]   person to break four minutes on the mile.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   And then it was something like the year after that, almost everyone could do it.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.560]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.480]   So I have a few follow-ups on the memory palace.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.880]   I went through this example with you.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.600]   I feel like now I could definitely get it right, especially even the sparkling
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.960]   water, and I'll probably remember it in the morning as well, but how does it
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.040]   work if you're doing multiple disciplines?
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.200]   Do you use the same memory palace?
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.040]   And what happens if you're recycling that memory palace five, six, seven
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.320]   times in a few days, does it all get mixed up or do you have a way to wipe
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.960]   it clean so you can start over?
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.400]   Or it just seems like it would be difficult to do it a lot of different times.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.360]   So the first thing is that for such a memory competition, like a world
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.480]   championship, I not have just one memory palace.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.480]   You have now a part of a memory palace with five locations, but you could easily
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.960]   do like 30 or 50 in your house, I guess.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:36.280]   So I have not just five locations or 50, I have more than 2000 locations.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.720]   And that means a location is the door, a location is the table.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.280]   So I have 30 in my apartment.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.880]   I have 50 in my mother's apartment.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.480]   I have 100 in the university.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   I have 150 in Japan, in a hotel when I was there.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.160]   I have some in San Diego.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.600]   I have some in Bahrain.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.640]   I have some in the UK.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   I have some in the supermarket around the corner.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.840]   So I have memory palace all over the place.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.440]   So that means that I can use fresh memory palaces in a memory
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.960]   competition all over the place.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.600]   But you are right, things are there then.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.920]   So what happens in the next memory competition?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.440]   And the trick is just not recalling or reviewing it.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.760]   So if you not review your shopping list for the next two weeks, you will forget it.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.040]   Anyway, if you review it every day, you will never forget it.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.800]   But if you don't review it, you will forget it.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.600]   And that's what I do.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.120]   I try to not review stuff, what I memorized in a memory competition.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.520]   And then it's got just gone at some point.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:46.040]   And what I do in addition is I go through my memory palace and like going
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.960]   through it in an empty way, like just thinking of the door, just thinking of
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.400]   the table, thinking of the sofa without thinking of the actual image, which I
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.760]   memorized, that also helps.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.960]   So what technique are you using to kind of create, you know, let's take five
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.600]   minute numbers as an example.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.040]   You're trying to remember a lot of numbers in a short period of time.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.320]   How do you place those numbers?
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.480]   Is it you come up with a letter for a number or an image for a number?
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.120]   How does it work?
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.160]   Yeah, I actually, it's a letter for a digit.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.680]   So the very basic example is the two.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.840]   If you look at the two, it looks like a swan.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.400]   Now look at the two.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.600]   It looks a bit like a swan.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.040]   So a two could be a swan, but that's of course just a very basic example.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.080]   What I do is I have a letter like a number, like three.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:39.840]   And if I turn the three by 90 degrees, then it looks a little bit like an M.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:48.480]   Three is an M, and so if I have a three and another three, then I would try to
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.600]   find a word by adding vowels in the middle or to the end.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.640]   So M and M, I would create the word mommy or mom.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.560]   So you have an M, you have a vowel, you have another M.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.200]   So the vowels are joker.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   You can use them at every place here.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:12.040]   So, and another example for the one is like a T, looks a little bit like a T, the one.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.400]   So you have T, one, and three, M.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.160]   What could you create out of 13?
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:18.880]   One, three.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.120]   What image could you create with a T and an M?
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.680]   Try to make a word here.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.720]   Time.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.680]   Time.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.360]   And how would I imagine time?
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.040]   Like a clock.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   I would see a watch or a clock.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.440]   Or a team would be also possible.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:39.080]   So when I have to memorize the number 33, then I imagine my mommy standing
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.440]   in front of the door, my mom standing in front of the door and on the table,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.120]   there's a team fighting against each other.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.480]   So 13, 33, 30.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   And that's what I do.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.920]   So I transform a two digit or even a three digit number in a image.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.480]   And I put that image on my location.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.320]   And yeah, what I did is really, I created the system with 1000 images.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.400]   So I have a fixed image for every three digit number.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.160]   So if you name a three digit number, I probably can name you the image for that.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.960]   Let's try 712.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.680]   That's in English.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.360]   It's a geogene.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.120]   I'm not sure if that's the right word.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:27.800]   So in, in, in, in France, in the 18th century, if, when you get killed, you
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.720]   have to be, how do you call it?
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.280]   Guillotine.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.160]   Guillotine.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:31.920]   Guillotine.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.720]   Exactly.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.560]   That's a 712, a guillotine.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.520]   And that's because a seven is a seven, a G or kind of how?
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.200]   Yeah, it's a G and the one is a T and the two is an N.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.920]   They have a guillotine.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.080]   Okay.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.280]   And that's, it's a good example.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.120]   So when you have a longer number that you have to memorize, is the process
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.360]   you go through, what's the first three numbers converted to this thing, which
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.560]   for you, because you have a database of a thousand or 999, you know, different
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.040]   numbers, you just eat it immediately.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.320]   Go guillotine, throw it in the first place of the memory palace.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.960]   Next three, throw it in the second, next three, throw it in the third.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.160]   Exactly.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.280]   If you train that very hard and very often you become faster and faster.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:22.240]   So I can do 500 in five minutes, 500 digits in five minutes, which means like
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.400]   167 transformations and putting it on a location.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.040]   And so for that, you'd be using kind of two different memory palaces
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.280]   going from one to the next.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:40.040]   If I, if I have 167 images, I need a memory palace with 167 locations.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.640]   Or if I have just one with 100, I start there and the other 67, I go to another
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.120]   one or even I put two images on a location.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.960]   So I have six digits on a location, like we did here with two images.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   Then I spare some locations.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.800]   I just need half of them, but that's the technical part.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.080]   And similarly for cards, how, how does that work?
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.240]   Yeah, actually the same.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.000]   I transform every card into an image.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.960]   And actually what I do is I transform every combination, every possible
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   combination of two cards into one image.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:22.360]   So if you have two playing cards, there are 2,704 combinations possible.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.680]   And I have a unique image for every and every of these combinations.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.080]   And then I transform two cards into an image and put it on a location.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.160]   26 locations done.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.600]   Okay.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.200]   Okay.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.120]   So that makes sense.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.800]   I know one of the other disciplines that I didn't realize until I was
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.400]   kind of doing some research is on names and, you know, names are something
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.600]   that, you know, I want to get to eventually after this about, you know,
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.440]   memorizing them, but how do you, you know, numbers there's, there's a finite
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.040]   set of them, cards, there's a finite set, but, but new names, is there
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.320]   truly a finite set where you, you kind of have all of them or are you using
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.640]   a different technique to kind of memorize random names in, in that discipline?
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.840]   Yeah, so names is actually the discipline or not even a discipline, but also in
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.880]   daily life where most people or many people struggle and in a competition,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.600]   it's, it's very hard because we have international names and there are Chinese
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.120]   names, Mongolian names and Russian names, a lot of different names from different
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   countries, but, and that's quite tough because you have to be very creative and
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:34.840]   try to find an image for a very, very, yeah, unknown name for yourself.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   And that this is actually not a finite set.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.360]   There are unlimited names out there.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.160]   If you look on the international scale, but if you look just national names,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:52.200]   look up national names and you would check the 100 most used names in the
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.280]   US, then they repeat over and over again.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:01.040]   And, of course there are names which are unique, but many names repeat.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:07.240]   And if you have an unique image for every, let's say the list of the 100
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:12.680]   most familiar male names and female names, and like Chris is a Christian,
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.520]   someone who was a Christian, who was praying all the time.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.160]   So imagine you, I would imagine you, sitting here and praying before the
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.440]   interview, because you want to do it right, you're a Chris Christian and you
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.400]   will meet a lot of Christmas in your life.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.800]   So you can memorize that.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:34.400]   And if you have a list of that, the most familiar, most common names,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.840]   that's what I'm searching for.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.040]   Then you have a huge advantage.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.960]   Just try to create an image for the most common names and then,
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.360]   yeah, then you're ready to go.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.000]   And if it's getting more difficult, you need to be more creative.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.960]   Well, this, this is a perfect segue.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.400]   So I'm impressed at how quickly I remembered the list minus the water,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.840]   you know, and now that I think about it, I'm like, wow, I could very easily
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.440]   walk through tea, paper towels, duck, water, rice, hot sauce, lettuce,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.680]   soap, bananas, chocolate.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.920]   Like it's so easy now.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.720]   But when I think about things that could practically improve my work or, or my
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.040]   personal or professional life, you know, a list is something that's, you know,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.280]   pretty easy that I could just write down.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.040]   Obviously, if I don't have to, that's great.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.160]   And there are circumstances where I can't, but there are a lot of other
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.640]   things that I think, you know, are more practical things like
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.120]   remembering names at an event.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.440]   So maybe I could start there and kind of push on a few techniques that might be
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:37.400]   helpful for the kinds of memory exercises or skills that would be really helpful
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.240]   in our personal and professional lives.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.840]   And I guess names and faces is one of these things, because let's say you
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.200]   are going into a new job, to a new company, and they have to meet like
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.400]   30 new colleagues in the first day.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.320]   How cool would it be if you would be able to memorize all these
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.520]   names on the first day?
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.280]   I mean, you really make a different impression then, because if you memorize
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:08.120]   all these names then, and you say, Hey, Chris, Hey, Andy, Hey, Maria, nice to
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:14.040]   meet you, then it's really a different story if you would do it like, Hey, you
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.600]   with the red shirt, what was your name again?
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.120]   So that gives you a social skill, which is very, very nice to have.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:27.960]   So the story here or the technique here is what I really talked about already is
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:33.720]   like creating an image for many common names, like Chris, Maria is also a
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.280]   Christian image, like the mother Maria, but having something else, maybe you can
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.960]   name, you have a name on your mind, which I can give it a try on, Chris.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.520]   I mean, it's funny you said Andy, which was actually the name of the first
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.400]   person I met at the company I work at.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.480]   And, and so would you just come up with an image that is unique to that
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.280]   person or unique to the name?
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.200]   To the name, because you connect the image to the name then, that's
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.080]   the second step, second step.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.640]   So what, can you think of an image if you think of the name Andy?
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:14.000]   Yeah, what, what, what comes to mind for me is the, the Toy Story doll
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.600]   that has Andy written on the boot.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.720]   Nice.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.160]   Okay.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.360]   Now you have that doll and you need to connect that doll to the
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.880]   real Andy in your company.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.640]   So try to find something, what is unique about this Andy in your company?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:36.080]   Has, does he have the very big ears or always wearing nice shirts or a very
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.320]   deep voice, something unique about that guy, what is it?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.040]   Yeah, I'm afraid he's going to be listening.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.360]   So I have to be careful here.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Maybe he has beautiful eyes or something.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.360]   I feel like I I've seen Andy wear a lot of sweaters, you know,
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.520]   he used to have longer hair.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.320]   He's, he's a little taller than most people.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:53.920]   Okay.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.120]   Longer hair is a nice one.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:00.600]   So you could try to imagine this little doll crawling through his hair.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.920]   So if you see him next time, I, I'm pretty sure you cannot avoid thinking of that.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.720]   So this doll crawling through his hair, so you would imagine, ah, this is Andy, the,
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.120]   the doll here, and so this name, this man's name is Andy.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.040]   Of course, you know, know Andy already, but that's how it works.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.320]   So you try to find a unique feature on the person in the face or in the voice or
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.400]   whatever makes it this person unique.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.560]   And you connect your image from the name to that feature.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.600]   So if you, when you need, when you meet the person again, you see the feature and
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.120]   there is the name connected to that feature, actually a bit like the memory
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.920]   palace, because in the memory palace, you connect images to locations and here you
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.840]   put, you connect images to special features on persons and that works pretty well.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:57.120]   So like Andy, I would have been gone with any, and I would imagine, I'm not sure if
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:03.960]   you have seen this movie, Man on the Moon, and I would imagine Andy Kaufman
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.520]   standing on the shoulder of this Andy, maybe making up his hair.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.720]   So that would be maybe my story.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.200]   And it's, it's a matter of training.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.600]   If you do it just once, it's like, okay, I cannot, if I meet five new
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.440]   people, how can I do that?
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.040]   I mean, I don't have the time.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.800]   It's like a hello, hello, hello.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.000]   And I am very occupied by you saying my all my own name five times.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.920]   But if you go into the situation and say, okay, I tried to memorize this name.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.040]   Then you just use the name.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.920]   Hi, Andy.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.680]   Nice to meet you.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.840]   And then you create your image afterwards.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:43.640]   So you don't have to do it on spot, but be just more aware of memorizing names.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.440]   That's the first step.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.000]   And the second step is using these memory techniques.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.160]   So it sounds like, you know, the advice I'd always heard is try to
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.720]   repeat the person's name a lot.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.520]   And it sounds like that's a good technique for the short term, but it
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.800]   probably doesn't last forever.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.640]   So you could use this to take that even further.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.760]   Yes.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.680]   And you use that for short term and then you take that name.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.040]   And when you left the situation, you just make your image
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.520]   because that lasts way longer.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:19.320]   So use that short term memory, but then go with, create a story, create an image.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.440]   And that works pretty well for that.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.800]   And I mean, there's other stuff like talking without notes, going
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.880]   into important negotiation.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.040]   For example, you want to talk about six important points and you don't want
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.160]   to look on your notes all over the place.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.040]   You want to be present and you want to talk without notes.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.680]   So you just memorize them.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:43.760]   And even giving a longer speech is possible with these techniques because
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.440]   you put your key notes on your memory palace.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.120]   So you're going again with your memory palace and it's helpful in so many
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.080]   situations, not even, not just in exams.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.200]   And it's obvious having that in for school or your studies, but it's also
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.600]   helpful in daily life and in social situations where you have to come up
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.480]   with important points and you may be very nervous.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:13.520]   So you go into the job interview, you go into this negotiation by having all
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.480]   these key notes in your head, in your memory palace, and you just have to walk
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.680]   through your memory palace being there in the job interview.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.240]   Don't close your eyes too often.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:23.800]   That works.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.720]   That looks a bit strange, but if you're a bit trained to that, then you are able
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:34.880]   and capable of doing that just on spot without any problems anymore.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.440]   So that was one that I actually had in my mind.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.120]   I was like, wow, today I had eight or 10 questions that I wanted to make
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.880]   sure I brought up in this interview.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.160]   I was like, wow, it'd be great if I could memorize them and not look at my notes.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.280]   How do you do that with kind of more abstract concepts?
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.600]   So if I wanted to ask a question, you know, about can you recycle a memory
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:59.880]   palace, you know, I don't have a visual image like I did for a paper towel.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.000]   Or if I knew that I wanted to remind someone in a job interview about my
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.680]   experience spending a summer, you know, at a farm and maybe the farm
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.160]   has a, has a better, a better visual memory.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.480]   So maybe it's a, I just wanted to remind them that, you know, I, I, I'm
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.560]   really good at being punctual and on time and that kind of thing.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.600]   When you, when you have these abstract things that aren't as visual, do you
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   kind of convert them to objects or how do you, how do you memorize
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.480]   10 points for a presentation?
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:33.800]   So the first thing is when you think about giving a presentation, what you do,
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.960]   let's say it's 10 points, if you would write down notes, your notes would be
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.840]   awesome, maybe one, two or three images, three words, maybe not, not more
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   because one, two or three words will remind you of the rest.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.720]   So what you actually have to memorize is not the sentence, but just a
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.960]   keynote, a keyword.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:59.880]   And for example, this question about recycling memory palaces could be a
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.000]   recycle bin, could be just a recycling something.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.840]   So you imagine yourself standing at your door, recycling something there.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:12.200]   And that word recycling would remind you of the rest or for even more abstract
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:18.840]   things like being on time that I would imagine that myself, so I would create a
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.400]   memory palace with 10 locations.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.680]   And when I want to talk about the farm and next, I want to talk about being on
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.720]   time on the first location, I would memorize the farm.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.640]   It's easy, just a farmer or a chicken, another chicken.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.480]   And then the second location I would memorizing being on time would memorize
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.880]   myself, staying there, sitting there, looking at my watch and pointing on my
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.440]   watch, be on time.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.960]   You have to be here, maybe telling that my girlfriend or someone else, you have
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.120]   to be here on time.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.480]   It's like, imagine myself in this situation.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.080]   And that is also an image.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.880]   It's abstract, but it's an image.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.440]   Being on time is a feeling.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.200]   Trying to be, being late is a feeling.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.520]   You feel bad, you feel stressed.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.360]   It's a feeling.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.520]   And I try to memorize that feeling, being stressed on the couch, feeling I have to
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.480]   be on time sitting while I'm sitting on the couch, something in that direction.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.640]   It's, it's not just an object you memorize.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.440]   It's also everything what surrounds that object.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.200]   It's not just the object itself.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.440]   It's be, it's a feeling.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.880]   It's a situation.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.720]   It's the, yeah, the embarrassment of being not on time.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.000]   That's what I memorize.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.600]   It reminds me of my rice and hot sauce example.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.560]   Like the more visceral it is of, of the feeling of the, the rice is being burned
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.920]   in the hot sauce and the more kind of extreme it can be, maybe makes it more
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.560]   memorable.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.040]   Exactly.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.800]   And, uh, it hasn't, doesn't has to be extreme every time, but it has to be
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.280]   something what works for you.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.360]   So if, if extreme works for you, go with that.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.560]   But if more, uh, causal works for you, go with that.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.440]   And if shiny works for you, go with shiny and it's up to you.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.000]   And does it work for things out of order?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.520]   So, you know, when, if I'm trying to remember numbers, like you are in your,
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.920]   your, you know, your exercise for the competition, it's like, well, yeah, they
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.160]   have to be written down in order.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.360]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.240]   But you know, if I was in a job interview and I knew there were seven or eight
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.640]   things that I really wanted to convey, the conversation is, is often led by the
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.320]   other person.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.040]   It might flow in a different path.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:33.320]   Is there some way to add, you know, a lack of order to memory, or is it just,
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.720]   you know, every time I'm about to say something, I kind of run through the
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.200]   list, start to finish again?
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.280]   Does that make sense?
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.000]   So let's say you have like eight things you want to talk about.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.440]   And as you said, the conversation is running somewhere else.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.280]   And then you think there was something left.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:53.080]   Then if you're used to it, it's not difficult to go through your eight
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.720]   locations very fast, like in three or four seconds, just look for, ah, I didn't
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.440]   talk about that.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.720]   I want to talk about that.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.960]   So you go through your list then.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.240]   And I think that's the story here.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.520]   Put it into the order on your memory palace.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.440]   And if it's not too many, you just can go through it.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   And if it's many, you can also go through it and maybe takes a bit more time, but
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.800]   actually you can find what is missing.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:22.280]   That's always if we would have, if I would call out now like eight out of these 10
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:27.360]   items, you would be able to check which are missing by just going through your
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.640]   locations and thinking about what did he never mentioned and he would come up with
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:32.920]   that.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.040]   And that works pretty good.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.440]   It's funny as you answering this, I was thinking about the one, the list we made
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.160]   earlier and I was like, wow, I could go through that list so fast.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.120]   So if anyone listening hasn't been trying to do this exercise on their own, I would
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.400]   strongly recommend maybe even pause, run through it yourself.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:55.080]   And I'm just surprised at how easily that list comes together, despite that I missed
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:55.960]   one in the first time.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.440]   But, but that's a, that's an experience where you, you have now, right?
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.960]   You, you have the feeling, wow, it works.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:06.760]   And you could go backwards too, doesn't matter, forwards, backwards, and you need
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.200]   to make this experience.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.000]   You need to do it by yourself because otherwise it's like, okay, he did that
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.640]   now, but I couldn't do it.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   But you will see it's so easy and it works so good.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.760]   And you reviewed that so often now.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.080]   I don't think that you will buy something else in the future anymore, always the
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.960]   same items now.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.920]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.760]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.680]   This has been so interesting.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.680]   How, how do you exercise all your brain for all this and practice?
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.160]   Is it just doing it over and over again, even if it's not part of something you
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.320]   actually need to memorize?
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.960]   Are there types of things you do to, to train or practice to, to get better at
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.320]   memory?
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.560]   Yeah, I think that's also a very important question because if you want to do it for,
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:15.480]   or use it for your daily life stuff, you can jump right in and try, but the best
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:22.440]   practice is to do training like you would do in memory sports, so I don't go to the
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:29.160]   gym, but I have my memory sports gym at home, uh, memorizing for memory sports, a
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.720]   list of words each day, or even 100 digits or something.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   So what I really do in my workout is memorizing random stuff, random words,
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:44.320]   random cards, random numbers, random names, and do that every day.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:50.320]   That's, that's a good step because continuing doing it every day on a daily
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.640]   basis, or at last, at least five times a week, that's the key.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:59.120]   You can train once a month for three hours or you train daily and training
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.680]   daily will give you a better result.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.520]   Like breathing your teeth, you wouldn't do it for two hours once a month, but
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.120]   daily, and that's the best result.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.400]   Are there, are there other things that help with this besides memory, like
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.880]   mindfulness training with meditation or breath work or anything like that?
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.360]   Definitely.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.840]   I mean, everything what helps you, what usually helps you in being not that
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.960]   stressed or more relaxed, just more relaxed or more aware of what is around
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.880]   you helps you.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.360]   So meditation is really a good thing to calm yourself down.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.760]   And that's what I told you before, before I start, I always have a one minute
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.680]   meditation to be more relaxed, to be in the memory mode.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:47.400]   And, but actually memorizing for one hour is a meditation itself.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.560]   Imagine that you, I mean, you're in your memory palace, you're just seeing
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.360]   images, you're putting them in a location, in a rhythm, in a specific
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.080]   rhythm again and again for one hour.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.400]   It's kind of a huge meditation.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.200]   And you always feel that your thoughts are going somewhere else.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.200]   You have to bring them back to the exercise and that's meditation, isn't it?
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:15.000]   So, but yeah, everything, what helps you feeling better, being more relaxed,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.400]   having a more mindful mind helps you also of course, for being better at your
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.800]   memory skills.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:30.480]   And do the benefits of all of this brain training, memory training translate to
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.280]   other skills like learning a language or anything like that?
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.240]   Yes.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.880]   I mean, for learning a language, you could also use memory techniques.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:44.000]   Learning vocabulary is, memory techniques is built for that somehow.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.040]   So learning vocabulary, for example, the world record for kids, we're learning a
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:55.720]   list of vocabulary in five minutes is 70 words in five minutes, 70 words in five
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.120]   minutes.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:02.960]   And so that's a side skill you have automatically if you train your memory.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.120]   But also what I said before is creativity.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.640]   Imagine you create these stories all over the place, you become more creative.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:16.760]   You see connections where you don't see them usually because you are telling
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.360]   stories, you're creative, you use your fantasy.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:25.760]   So that's really also something what just happens on the side without really
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.240]   noticing it in the first place.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.320]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.440]   I'm like very excited to start applying a lot of these lessons, but I'm also
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.240]   curious for you, you do coaching.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.320]   Have you turned memory sports into a career and is this something that has
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.640]   become a profession for you?
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.560]   Do you win big prizes when you win championships or what's the state of
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.960]   memory as a profession?
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:52.440]   Yeah, so memory sports is a profession as a profession.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.760]   I mean, over the last 16 years, I won two world championships and a lot of
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:04.120]   competitions, and I think my overall earnings are like $50,000, which sounds
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.960]   good in the first place, but over 15 years, you cannot make a living out of that.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.720]   So prices are low.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.200]   It's really under the radar, not many people knowing about that.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:20.840]   So sometimes you just get a nice sweet box as a prize or something.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:25.680]   It's also nice, but getting chocolate doesn't help you paying your rent.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   So it's not about being on the top of the memory sports ladder here, but
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.360]   it's about giving the coaching.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:38.040]   And I built my career on, of course, on my success in memory sports, because
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.960]   that gives me the background.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   Being a world champion is great and you know what you are talking about.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:49.840]   And now since a couple of years, I'm building this coaching, helping people
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.520]   for daily life issues, helping students, helping kids, but also, of course,
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.880]   business coaching for managers who want to manage their memory in a better way,
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.200]   memorizing all the clients or stuff like that.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.840]   So that's really something where you can build, pay your rent from,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.800]   but not because of memory sports.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.880]   That's not possible.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.800]   I mean, you mentioned these events take place around the world.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.200]   So over 16 years, I have to imagine you might've spent as
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.840]   much as you've won in flights.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.720]   Yes.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.920]   And I am on the top, right?
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:27.720]   So people not being in the top five have no chance to pay their bills just
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.920]   for the flights because there is no prize money left.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:36.280]   The biggest prize money what I won once was $10,000 once and another time, $8,000.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:42.760]   So even these 50,000 are just seven or eight competitions combined.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.960]   Well, you could tell all of the people not winning to check out a few
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.040]   episodes about points and miles.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.680]   Maybe they can learn to travel for free, which is a good segue into my last
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:58.440]   question, which is about other things outside of memory, you've clearly been
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.960]   someone who's learned how to optimize and even hack their way to becoming
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   kind of a world champion, not even kind of becoming a world champion twice.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:11.840]   Are there other aspects of your life where you've optimized things or you
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.960]   have unique tactics or routines that you use to upgrade the way you live?
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.760]   I tried a lot of things.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:22.200]   One thing what I tried and which worked very well for quite a while
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.120]   was gamification of my life.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:29.240]   So like having my own coin system, point system.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:34.520]   So I was putting everything into this app and I was getting
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.320]   points for checking my emails.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.440]   I was getting points for making this call to the dentist.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:44.280]   I was getting points for having this new client.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.720]   So for all things in my life, and then I rewarded myself.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.080]   When I get collected 100 points, I get something.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.400]   So that worked pretty well, actually.
[00:59:54.400 --> 01:00:02.200]   But at one point I was just creating tasks for my points scale and that
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.520]   was not going anywhere anymore.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.240]   So I skipped that, but it was working for a while.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:13.760]   And nowadays I'm using like cooperative management tools like what you use
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.000]   sometimes in companies, I use that for myself for my different projects because
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.560]   I have so many different projects and it's good to have an overview about
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.080]   everything.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.840]   So there's a big mind map included.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.080]   I see everything on one page, but everything is also splitted.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.680]   So specific tasks for specific days.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.400]   That's one thing what I can recommend.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.760]   So if you have three projects, don't try to do all the projects in one day.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.840]   Focus on one project each day.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.880]   That also helps me.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:49.440]   So yeah, managing my stuff and my, my things with these apps, there's, and
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.040]   there are plenty of them out there.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.760]   This is really helpful for me and yeah, helps me to structure
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.120]   my life and my projects.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.800]   And are there specific apps that you like that, that people can, can try out?
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.080]   ClickUp is one of these apps.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.600]   I'm not sure if you know that, but it's, it's pretty nice.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.520]   It's, it's amazing.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.280]   It connects your Google calendar with your ClickUp and you have everything
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.400]   in one place and you can integrate Zoom and everything.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.840]   So I'm not sponsored by that, but I can recommend it anyway.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.560]   So ClickUp, if you hear me, please get in touch.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.040]   Yeah, that would be great.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.840]   Are there, are there apps or services online or videos that you think people
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.000]   should check out to practice memory or to learn more?
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.880]   For memory Anki, A-N-K-I is a very, very helpful app to, yeah, to learn your own
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.000]   stuff, you can put in your own stuff you want to learn and you can use this Anki
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.800]   method, which is actually a review method.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.160]   Memorizing stuff is not just about memorizing it, but also about reviewing
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.680]   and some stuff you have to memorize, review more often, some, something less.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.600]   And this app helps you here.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.840]   That's really cool.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.000]   And of course, if you want to learn something about, or want to check out
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.960]   memory sports, you can watch my Twitch channel where I usually do commentary
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.120]   on memory sports matches, and that's a really cool thing.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.720]   It's a small channel still, but yeah, you will meet all the great memories,
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.200]   people around the world on that channel and can recommend that.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.560]   That's awesome.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.440]   I mean, that's the reason if you're watching the video, you'll see
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.480]   Johannes has a green screen and I'm sure that's what it's for.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.080]   Any, any other places that people should find you online or learn
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:34.880]   about what you're working on?
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.120]   So my memory sports TV is the name of my Twitch channel, but also my website,
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.560]   johannes-malo.com, you can get in touch with me and to learn something about it.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.520]   So that's johannes-malo.com.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.920]   Yeah, yeah, thanks.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.160]   Just want to make sure you get it, but the links to all that's in the show
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.200]   notes and just last quick question on coaching, is that something you offer
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.360]   to anyone that people listening who want to improve memory and their work or
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.880]   their personal life can get in touch?
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.840]   Yes, definitely get in touch.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.720]   And then usually I have the talk with the people because I really want to help
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.680]   them and I want to figure out, can I help you or not?
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.080]   That's the most important part.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.960]   But if I can help you, then everyone can get in touch with me and
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.040]   let's see what we can do.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.440]   That sounds great.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.800]   This was fantastic.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.000]   Thank you, Chris, for inviting me and yeah, it was a nice show and I hope you
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.840]   will not forget your shopping list and maybe extend that for the next time.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.520]   I will do my best.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:34.920]   Thank you.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.200]   Good.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.160]   Thanks.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.320]   What a fantastic conversation.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.680]   I'm even recording this outro three days later because I wanted to see
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.160]   if I still remembered the list.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.960]   Paper towels, tea, chicken, sparkling water, rice, hot sauce,
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.040]   lettuce, soap, chocolate, bananas.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.480]   Boom.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.960]   And I haven't even practiced at all since our conversation.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.400]   So these techniques really work.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.960]   I hope that for everyone listening, you get similar success and
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.560]   you have fun practicing this.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.840]   And with a little practice, I'm hoping I can get this
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.440]   whole system down even faster.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.680]   I'm going to be planning another Q&A episode soon.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.600]   So please send over any questions you have for me or really
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.440]   any thoughts or feedback too.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.160]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com and it's Thanksgiving in the US tomorrow.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.520]   So everyone out there who's subscribed to the show, who's written me an email,
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.760]   posted a review online, shared the show with friends or anything else to
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.200]   support me and All The Hacks, thank you so much.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.640]   I am so grateful for all of you and I'm so excited for everything
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.080]   we have coming down the road.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.920]   Finally, for those of you celebrating Thanksgiving, have a wonderful time.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.240]   Hopefully you're getting to spend it with friends and family.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.800]   That's it for this week.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.880]   See you all next week.
