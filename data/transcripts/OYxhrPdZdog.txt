[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.280]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. I'm sure we take questions straight from you. We've
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.320]   got a lot of questions, like I said, last week. We're going to try to do a lightning
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.800]   round today. Before we get to that, remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Duncan, last
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400]   week's show, I mentioned the 50/30/20 rule, right, of budgeting. And I said, I don't know
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.440]   where it comes from. A lot of these things in finance, they just sound good and they
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.000]   stick like the 60/40 portfolio. No one actually knows who started that or where it came from.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.600]   We all just kind of subscribe to it. But the 50/30/20 rule, last Thursday after we did
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.400]   the show, I was reading a book at night, kind of read before I go to bed. I was reading
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.040]   this book called "Die with Zero" by a guy named Bill Perkins. And the whole idea is
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.400]   if you have a lot of money, your hope should be to spend that money, either give it away
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.880]   to charity or spend it all on experiences before you die. Interesting concept.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.960]   That's what you were talking about in "Animal Spirits."
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.160]   Yeah. One of the chapters of that same book, he said the 50/30/20 rule comes from a very
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.440]   well-known politician today. It's a woman. Do you have any guesses? A politician came
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440]   up with this.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   Elizabeth Warren.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.440]   Elizabeth Warren. Before she entered politics, Warren had been a law professor with special
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.240]   expertise in bankruptcy and co-wrote books about why middle-class Americans go broke
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.920]   and how to avoid that dismal fate. She suggested the 50/30/20 rule, which she called the balanced
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.960]   money formula, as a way to help people maintain financial stability. Had no idea. This is
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   the Elizabeth Warren rule.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   Did not know that.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   Yeah. That's kind of crazy.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960]   Did not know that.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.160]   All right. So, we're just going to get right into it because last week we mentioned we're
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.240]   overflowing with questions. So, we're going to do something of a lightning round today.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.120]   Rapid fire. We still have an expert coming on at the end of the show, but I think we
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320]   did seven or eight questions right away. We're just going to go rapid fire. We had a lot
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.960]   of them and I don't need to spend a ton of time. So, I think Duncan's got a timer for
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   me even.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   He's going to buzz me if I go too long.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.440]   I'm going to time you on the Apple Watch, and I've actually got a sound effect timer
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   and buzzer.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   All right.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   All right. Let's do it.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   We're ready to go.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   Question one.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   Okay.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.000]   Okay. Can you please explain how the Fed raising interest rates fights off inflation? I understand
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.360]   it can slow down the housing and car market, but how does it impact other goods? Bikes,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.560]   dishwashers, clothes, et cetera. Especially when there are supply side issues. Would the
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.520]   Fed be raising rates if demand and supply were at equilibrium?
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.640]   This is true. The Fed can't prove more semiconductors. It can't build more houses. It can't put more
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.120]   cars in the lots. Here's one of the things they can do. They can make money more expensive
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   so maybe people don't buy a second home because instead of 3%, it's 5%. I'm not going to pay
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.360]   for another house here. I'm not going to buy a vacation home. Maybe some companies cut
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.120]   back on investments because the hurdle rate is now much higher. I think it's also a psychological
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.480]   component to this. People see asset prices fall and they might cut back on spending.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.280]   Bill Dudley, who's a former New York Fed chair, wrote yesterday in Bloomberg, "In contrast
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.640]   to many other countries, the U.S. economy doesn't respond directly to the level of short-term
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.240]   interest rates. Most home borrowers aren't affected because they have long-term fixed-rate
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.600]   mortgages. And again, in contrast to many other countries, U.S. households do hold a
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.280]   significant amount of their wealth in equities. As a result, they're sensitive to financial
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.200]   conditions. Equity prices influence how wealthy people feel and how willing they are to spend
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.440]   rather than save." He's saying the Fed has to jack up rates to lower the stock market.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.640]   That kind of makes sense. I don't know what the unintended consequences are going to be.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.000]   Is a recession going to be better than high inflation? I think we might get a chance to
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   find out if the Fed has their way. But yeah, the Fed can't make supply chain issues go
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.280]   better, get back without helping demand. A lot of pressure here. All right, let's do
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   the next one. Shot clock. That was pretty close. All right, next one. The best thing
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.560]   about the Fed, too, is you can always blame the Fed if things don't go your way. Of course.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.960]   That's what I like about it. Perfect scapegoat. What particular sectors or names come to mind
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.400]   for young investors with a 35 to 40-year time horizon? All right, easy. I don't know. I
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.640]   have no idea. You could say technology. That'd be an easy one. But who knows what the companies
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280]   are going to be? There was this book I read. My brother got it for me for Christmas one
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   year in 2007. The Forever Portfolio by James Altucher of all people. And he picked these
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.700]   stocks that you could hold forever for decades and decades. Most of the stocks you've never
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.520]   heard of today because things change. It was right before the Great Recession. And then
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.400]   you had all this other stuff happening afterwards. And so all the stocks that ended up doing
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   well, you wouldn't have picked. So even picking out a decade and a half later is harder than
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.720]   three to four decades. John, throw up this chart of the biggest stocks in the S&P going
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.640]   back to 1980. You can see here in 1980, it was basically all energy stocks. These stocks
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.940]   have turned over so many times. It's so hard to pick. So maybe if you want to say like
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.040]   tech, technology is going to be a big part of our lives. Maybe the NASDAQ 100. But if
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.400]   you have three to four decades ahead of you, guess what? The easiest thing to do is you
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.960]   bet on the market. Corporations will continue to produce profits. They'll continue to innovate.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.600]   That's what you want to do. Trying to pick certain stocks or sectors up for three to
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.280]   four decades in the future, when the future is so uncertain, is really difficult and basically
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.160]   impossible to do. Perfect timing. Look at that. Nailed it. I actually had a follow up
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.620]   on that one real fast. What percentage of companies do you think will no longer even
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.860]   be around in 40 years? A very high percentage. Yeah, it seems like a lot. Yes. Through bankruptcy
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.600]   or mergers and acquisitions or whatever, yes. Picking those companies is ridiculous. After
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.560]   that long, it's hard to do it for next year, next five years, 10 years, 30 or 40 years
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.600]   in the future is really difficult. Okay, so up next we have, what will bring more value
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.480]   in the long run for a child? Paying for a fancy private college that totals $250,000
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.920]   or sending them to a mid-tier public school on a full ride and putting that $250,000 into
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   an index fund for their retirement? Listen, this is the type of question that is way easier
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.680]   to answer as an older person than a younger person. When you're older, you can easily
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.240]   say, "Don't spend a lot of money on a wedding because that's a waste of money," or, "Why
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.600]   would you spend all this money on college when you can just invest it and start a business
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.640]   and go bet on yourself?" That's way easier to say as a younger person. Hey, outside of
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   the top 15 to 20 schools, it doesn't matter where your degree came from as long as you
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   get one. I think you use this as a teaching moment. You can say option one, you go to
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.000]   a really expensive school but you forego this potential financially being set up as a young
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.760]   person and maybe buying your first house or paying for a wedding or whatever you want
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.040]   to do with the money, retiring early, or you go to a state school but here's what you're
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.560]   giving up. You're not going to go to a nice expensive school that you want to. You could
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.400]   be missing out on experiences and which one do you regret more? You put all the information
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   out there for them. You use this as a teaching opportunity to maybe talk about compound interest
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.060]   a little bit before their eyes glaze over. But I say if you're going to do this, don't
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.460]   scold someone. Don't force them. Give them all the information and let them make the
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.440]   decision themselves, right? Because again, your decision at age 18, maybe they say, "You
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.000]   know what? I'll make my own money someday. I don't need your money. I want to go to this
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.560]   school because my friends are going there because that is this awesome program that
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.240]   I want to do," whatever. So I think that's what you do. You help them make an adult decision
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.920]   and let them figure out which path is better for them.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.040]   Yeah, no, that sounds like good advice. Also, yeah, so much of college is about what you
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.800]   make it. Like, there are people, there are brilliant people who go to, you know, like
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.560]   less prestigious schools and end up, you know, being very successful.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   Well, my favorite one is...
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:04.240]   Going to a private school doesn't really mean that much. Oh, did we lose you, Ben? Oh, I
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:16.920]   think we might have lost Ben there for a second. All right, well, let's give Ben a second to
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:32.520]   see if he comes back. And if he doesn't, then maybe I'll bring Matt back in. All right,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.800]   so we'll switch this up a little bit. So we'll go ahead and jump into Matt. So Matt, get
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.080]   ready. I'm going to get your opinion on this. What do you think about this question between
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.800]   the public mid-tier school and a private school? Also, I should introduce you. This is Matt
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.920]   Lurias, a young advisor extraordinaire at Red Horse Wealth. We were going to surprise
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.280]   you at question eight, but I'll go ahead and bring you in.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   Of course. Throw me a curveball right off the bat here. Love it. So I agree with Ben.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.780]   It's much easier to answer this as an older person, just saying, having gone through the
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:12.120]   experience of paying for these types of big events and saying, well, you know, did I really
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.840]   need that? But the experiences are worth something. So, you know, in terms of like, where are
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.320]   you going to go to school? You know, as long as you get a good education, I think, and
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.080]   even if it's a mid-tier school, if you're not paying as much money, you know, you'll
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.880]   probably end up okay at the end of the day. You'll end up all right. So, I mean, you know,
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.120]   don't, don't, don't kill yourself over it. Don't feel like you have to spend godly amounts
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   of money on, on school, but also at the same time, you want the experience, right? You
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.680]   want to be able to learn the things that, you know, don't necessarily happen in college,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.140]   you know, you know, meeting people, networking, all that type of stuff is important. And,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.840]   you know, when we're older, it's easy to say, did I really need that? But, right. Yeah.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.440]   Hindsight, people, if people aren't happy with their careers, they're always going to
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.680]   look back and be like, oh, I spent too much on college. But, you know, I think, I think
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.640]   that some of that is, yeah, hindsight bias. Also, we both went to school, you know, very
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.720]   close to each other. You went to Coastal Carolina on the coast of South Carolina. I went to
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.600]   UNCW on the coast of North Carolina. So, and I had a great, great experience. Okay,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.520]   so this is uncharted, uncharted territory. Ben is still not back. So he must be having
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.480]   some serious computer. Yeah, some computer difficulties. So yeah, we're taking over.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.080]   And yeah, I guess we'll just continue on. So John, John hit it. Let's, let's go to the
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:37.280]   next question. Okay, so did we get Ben back? Hold on. Let's see. Ben, are you back? Ben,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.640]   thank God. I'm on my phone. The power literally just went out of my business. You froze. I
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.360]   was like, how long do I give it before we just, like, completely, you know, regroup
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.000]   and continue on. So, but this is great. This is, it's not like we're alive or anything,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.680]   you know? Yeah, we're only, this is the power of life. My, the power in my whole office
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.800]   just literally shut down. And I'm sitting here in darkness, but I'm on my phone. So
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:09.240]   I apologize for the video. But hey, it works. It works. So we were wrapping up the college
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.000]   question. So we're, we're on to the next one. Matt had some, some good contributions there.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.760]   So I guess you can hop in and help out. Yeah, yeah. So we'll just have Matt, Matt on. The
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.280]   surprises is over. Okay, so up next, longtime viewer of the show, love all the content you
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.040]   put out. I'm 23 and just graduated from college. I landed my first job at a financial services
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.760]   firm and I'm wondering how I should allocate my earnings. Would you recommend focusing
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.500]   on paying off my student loans first around $30,000 or building up my retirement portfolio?
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.400]   My boring answer to this one is I like the idea of splitting it up because I think that's
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.800]   the simplest way to go about it. And I think building those financial habits early and
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.120]   saving important. Now it could be you're one of these people that just loves paying off
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.640]   debt because you hate it so much, right? Duncan, I can't remember. Are you a Duke or North
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.760]   Carolina fan? Because you're, you're from North Carolina. I'm a Duke fan. Okay. So some
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.720]   people hate debt as much as people outside of Durham, North Carolina hate coach K and
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.800]   Duke, right? Wow. Yeah. It's pretty vitriolic. It's pretty vitriolic. Come on. It was in
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.760]   the news a lot, but I'm just saying if you really, one of these people that just hate
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.600]   debt and cannot stand it, and it's going to keep you up at night, pay it off. And I like
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.360]   the idea of splitting it up and building those savings habits while you pay off the debt.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.840]   And then when the debt's paid off, roll that those payments into your savings. For sure.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.760]   I agree. I mean, you got to start contributing to the 401k at least, I think a little bit.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.680]   You don't have to do a lot, but you can do both at the same time. There's no reason why
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.280]   not. Yes. At least get your match. All right. Buzz it. So right on time. There we go. Um,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.000]   so one, one thing I had to add to that is just, yeah, the Dave Ramsey school of like
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.240]   no debt ever kind of thing that, that always to me is kind of annoying because it's like,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.280]   well, you're basically telling a lot of people that they can't like go to college then if
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.320]   they can't take out student loan debt, because you should never take out, you know, I feel
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.360]   like, like you're saying some people are so, so extreme about it that it's kind of off.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.960]   Yeah. That's a debt that's going to pay off for you. There's good and bad debt for sure.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:04.800]   Okay. So up next we have my friend who's 38 years old, has a 2.8% 30 year fixed mortgage,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.560]   roughly 24 years left and pays an extra $400 each month towards her principal. If she continues
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.140]   to prepay $400 towards her principal, she has about 16 years remaining. Her house has
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.360]   enjoyed strong appreciation in the past six years, about 85% according to Zillow. I told
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.880]   her I would show, I told her that I would slow pay the mortgage due to the phenomenal
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.400]   rate plus significant appreciation and invest the $400 a month in the stock market. What
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.080]   are your thoughts on this? I do think the rates matter in these things. Like my first
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.520]   interest rate I paid at my house, like 6.5% and we ended up refinancing a few times to
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.480]   the point where we kept making the same payment and it was like double by the end. But then
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.560]   when we sold our house after 10 years, I realized like, wait, what was that money doing for
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.800]   me? It was illiquid. It was just sitting there. It wasn't that great. I think if you have
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.160]   that low of a payment and it's taxed advantage, I think you have to think about that in terms
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.760]   of like, how are the rest of your finances? Are you on track with your retirement savings?
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:06.960]   Could you be using this money for something better than a 2.8% repayment on your house?
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.840]   Some people just don't like debt. So I mean, if that's how you are, you know, and if that's
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.800]   keeping you up at night, then pay it off. But yeah, otherwise it's probably other things
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.820]   you could be doing with it. And that's just, you know, it takes a little bit more deeper
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:23.060]   dive into your, your full picture. It's a really, really low hurdle rate. Yeah. Cool.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.580]   We didn't even get to the buzzer on that one. So let's let's keep trucking along. Okay.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.180]   So another Fed one. What happens when the Fed raises rates? Moreover, if the bond market
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:36.920]   has priced in several rate hikes, why raise rates 25 basis points per month? If 6.25 basis
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.800]   point hikes are priced in this year, what would happen if the Fed raised to 1% in March?
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.840]   I don't really understand this one. I have to be honest.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.000]   Okay. So they're basically saying the Fed has this target that they want interest rates
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.520]   to get to, but they're taking their time and it's going to take them a while to get there.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.440]   And if they're going to get to 2% or 3% anyway, why not just rip the bandit off and do it
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.720]   now? So they're taking a stair-step function where they're doing like little increments
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.480]   at a time. This is the hardest price, hardest part of investing is like what's priced into
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.240]   the market. No one really knows because there are no counterfactuals. And I think the idea
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.120]   is like, if they ripped the bandit off and did this, what would they be signaling? Like
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.360]   things are worse than people think. Would there be like a meltdown, some counterintuitive
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.560]   reaction? Like maybe the bond market would be worse than the stock market in this case.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   I think it's mostly psychological because people can't handle big, huge changes right
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.280]   away and throwing the kitchen stick. I think people would just freak out because so much
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:32.080]   of it is psychological. Yeah. I can't believe I'm doing this from my phone.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.720]   It's surreal. 45 seconds left on the timer, Matt. You have anything to add?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.680]   Let's just do the next one and then we can spend some time on the next question.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:47.120]   Okay. So up next, I'm 44 and single with no kids. I have a net worth of around $425,000.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.560]   College educated and a financial controller at a commercial real estate firm in Chicago.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.920]   I would have more if Twitter had performed better, though I didn't sell any or I haven't
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:04.480]   sold any. I own 5,550 shares at $29.83 cost basis. What do you think about where I am?
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.240]   Okay. So this one was obviously sent to us before Elon Musk decided to hop in and buy
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   9% of Twitter and the shares shot up 30% this year. So now this guy's up like 65% on his
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.880]   shares. John, throw the chart up on Twitter. This is Twitter since the IPO. Has not done
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.720]   great. So the S&P is up like 200% since Twitter went public. Twitter is up like 15%. That
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   includes this week's run-up in prices from Elon Musk taking over. I think it's funny
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   this guy included Twitter in his asking how he's doing. Because I think if your whole
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.440]   financial ecosystem is based around how one stock is doing and it has to make or break
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.840]   you, that's kind of tough. The other thing is you have an amount of money. The idea of
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.720]   answering where am I, I think that's hard to do because you have to answer where do
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.680]   I want to be, how much do I want to spend, when do I want to retire, what are my goals.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.920]   So Matt, someone comes to you and says, here's how much money I have, here's my age, here's
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.120]   where I want to be. How do you help them understand whether you're on the right track or not?
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.920]   Yeah. I mean, every situation is different. So we really have to take a look at everything
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.480]   that's going on and kind of see like, all right, where do you want to be? How do you
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.880]   envision the rest of your life playing out and what resources do you currently have to
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:21.040]   get there? And what capabilities do you have to continue to add to these goals and what's
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.000]   prioritized then? So I did a back of the envelope for this one. If this guy did nothing else
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.160]   at $425,000 or whatever he has, he earns 6% of his money, he retires at 65, he's got like
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.600]   $1.3 or $1.4 million. If, since he's a listener on the show, he's maxing out his 401k, he's
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.360]   maxing out his Roth IRA, so that's $26,000 a year, call it. If he did that in addition
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.280]   to what he already has, he'd have like $2.3 million. So I think you take that and you
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.560]   say, I don't know what the market's actually going to do, but if I need more than that,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.760]   I'm going to work longer, I'm going to save more. If I need less than that, maybe I can
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.880]   save less now or retire a little earlier. So I think that's how you look at those goal
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:02.840]   posts along the way. I cheated. I just did that one when you finished. I think that was
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.120]   all our lightning round. We did pretty good. I think we got through seven of them and we
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.400]   held two questions for Matt. We were going to bring Matt in now before I had my technical
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.680]   difficulties. Back to schedule programming. There's a storm here today, so yeah, my power
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.120]   went out. But let's do a couple more. We've got one floor that we've got for Matt here.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.800]   By the way, a lot of these questions I think are from younger viewers, which I think is
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.960]   great. So we wanted to bring Matt in, since he specializes in working with some younger
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.200]   investors. So let's ask the question here.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.600]   Okay. So what are some good questions to ask when selecting a financial advisor, especially
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.000]   as a young person?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.160]   All right. Really great question, because I think this is one of the hardest things
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.720]   for people to understand. I don't know, because you go to the hospital and they give you a
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.520]   checker. You don't select them. A lot of things, you don't really know what you're
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.360]   looking for. So Matt, why don't you talk about when you're talking to prospective clients,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.400]   what are the things they should be looking for and what are some of the red flags that
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   maybe they shouldn't be asking questions about?
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.920]   Yeah, definitely. It's a great question. I think anyone looking for an advisor, you
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.960]   have to be seeking out a long-term relationship. You want something that's going to last.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.680]   You don't want to hop around a bunch, go from advisor to advisor. So you really want
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.880]   to take it seriously. You want to do your due diligence and you want to ask the right
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:19.080]   questions. So there are wrong questions to ask as well. So right questions being obviously
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.200]   the obvious ones, are you a fiduciary? Are you going to serve my best interests at all
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.360]   times? If you're a younger investor, I think a key question is how do I fit into your firm's
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   philosophy given where I am in life right now? And how is that path going to evolve
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.520]   for me as a client of the firm?
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.880]   Yeah, you're right. As a young person, you could have certain things that are going on
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.240]   in your life and you have life events that change. So it's like, how can you help me
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   along the way as I have these changes happen?
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.360]   Right. So what are the services that I should be seeking out right now that you can provide
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.560]   to me? How will that change? And then what are the fees around those services? Do the
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.080]   fees change? Obviously, you don't want to be paying a ton of money for stuff you don't
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.600]   need. So you want to be cognizant of that as well, I think. And then we can get into
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.880]   like investment philosophy. If you're someone who is a little bit more experienced when
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   it comes to investing, you've done some on your own, right? Obviously, you want to make
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.760]   the relationship as easy as possible to be able to stick with it for a long time. So
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.840]   you want to make sure philosophies align, I think.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.880]   Yeah. I also think one of the most important things is like, what does the relationship
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.920]   look like going forward? Like, how are you going to work with me? How often are we going
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.440]   to talk and communicate? Because I know that can vary for our clients. Some people want
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.520]   to have their hand held and talk all the time. Some people want check-ins, you know, irregularly.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.560]   So it kind of depends, like, how are you going to work with me and how are you going to fit
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.640]   with my schedule and personality?
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:46.800]   Yeah. I think the key is expectations have to be aligned in the beginning. So spend time
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.200]   with whoever you're talking to. Talk to more than one firm and really make sure that you're
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.080]   getting, you're setting out on the right foot in terms of what the expectations are for
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.560]   both the advisor and the client. And both should desire the same thing in terms of having
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.240]   a long-term relationship that's beneficial to most importantly the client.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.480]   Yeah. A lot of it comes down to, here's what I want out of you. Can you actually fulfill
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.240]   what I want? Or are you just telling me what I want to hear?
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   I agree.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.960]   Do you ever get any, like, personal questions, like your favorite music or sports or stuff
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.200]   like that? I mean, because it seems like people would naturally want to know that stuff if
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   they're going to have a long-term relationship.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.600]   Definitely. You know, that's the fun part is getting to know people and really getting
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.400]   to mesh with certain people and see like, hey, do we even get along? You know, sometimes
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.440]   you don't get along with somebody. It has nothing to do with finance or numbers or financial
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.680]   plans and it's like, all right, you know, we just get along and I trust this person.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   I think trust is a huge thing. Obviously, it seems obvious, but you want to trust whoever
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.920]   you're seeking out as an advisor.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.280]   So a lot of times you want to work with someone that you like and respect. And yeah, trust
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.520]   I think is the big one for sure.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.760]   Yeah. Yeah. I would need to ask favorite Beatles album. So I just put it in the chat. No, I'm
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760]   just kidding.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   I mean, worst, Duncan, worst podcast question ever. Beatles or Stones, right?
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.960]   Oh, because, well, because of the obviousness of it, you know, it's like, it's not even
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   a contest.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.120]   Yes. Yes. Okay. Let's do the next one.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:19.280]   I probably just made a bunch of people mad. Okay. So last but not least, I'm in my thirties
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.760]   and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.240]   rates so low and they were at this one a while back, but should I take a, take a loan anyway
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.800]   and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market?
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.980]   I think this is interesting that like rates could change the story going from a 3% mortgage
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.360]   rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.920]   to pay in full cash. Now, maybe it kind of makes sense. But first of all, kudos to this
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.080]   person for having that amount of money. I don't know where they live to be able to buy
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.520]   in cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.400]   a client and this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.800]   right? A lot of this is personality driven and depending on what the person wants to
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.040]   get out of it. So how do you help someone work through a big decision like this? Because
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.400]   this is, this is a huge decision. We're talking about a huge lump sum of money, you know,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.720]   six or seven figures here, potentially depending on how much home they're buying.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.520]   Yeah. Like a lot of these questions, there are a lot of qualitative elements that need
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.480]   to be addressed, right? As opposed to just where can I make the most money? You know,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.240]   what should I, what should I do in that sense? It's really about, you know, what's the opportunity
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.520]   cost, right? What other goals do you have that this money you could be throwing into
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.020]   equity in your home could be used for, right? Do you have kids? Do you want to help them
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.440]   get to college and go to college? You know, if they're young, you might want to front
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.340]   load a five to nine plan and use some of this money for that. So that's just one example,
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.800]   but there's a lot of things that, you know, play into this as opposed to just, Hey, I've
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.760]   saved up the money. Should I just throw it all into my house?
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.480]   I also think, especially when you're young, uh, borrowing money makes more sense to me
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.080]   because especially with a house that offers more liquidity, flexibility, you can't really
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.720]   spend your house in a pinch. You could obviously borrow against it, but having some flexibility
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.880]   to do something with that cash and then still having that cash to, if, if, if you realize
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.680]   a few years down the road, like I made a mistake here, you can still pay it off eventually,
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.320]   right? You still have that cash somewhere. So, so I think that that is the kind of thing
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.640]   where it's, it's hard to take that one back. If you buy the house in all cash, obviously
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.920]   maybe one of the things now is, well, if you're getting into a bidding war, having all cash
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.800]   could, could make more sense and help. But I think especially when you're young, you'll,
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.400]   you lose some of that flexibility by just having it paid off.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.640]   Definitely. I mean, the interest rate part of it is, is pretty big. I think, I mean,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.120]   a couple of months ago, you know, it's, it's like you said, it's more obvious, but still,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.920]   even with where we're at today, you want the flexibility. You want to be able to fund other
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.680]   parts of your life. Having everything tied up in equity, you know, is, you know, it's,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.600]   it could be restraining a little bit, but again, you've got these people, they just
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.100]   hate that. So, you know, if that's the type of client that I'm dealing with, you know,
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.480]   the conversation is going to lean that way and there's nothing wrong with that. There's
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.800]   nothing, you know, we can, you know, we can, we can gear towards that type of conversation
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.840]   if it's required for the person that we're dealing with.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   Duncan, I'm not going to make a Coach K, Duke reference here, because I know it's a, it's
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.040]   a touchy subject right now. I didn't, I didn't realize.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   It's rough. Yeah.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   Sorry. Tough weekend.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.200]   It's been rough. A tough way for them to go out, but literally the worst team they could
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.480]   have lost to, you know, everyone knows that, I guess, but yeah.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.040]   Yeah, that had, that had to be tough.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   It's rough.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.440]   Thanks to Matt for stepping in here. I've been in this office for six years, seven years
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.040]   now almost, and I've never lost power before. So yeah.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.960]   Glad I could be the one on here today to experience the time, and thanks Matt for stepping in.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   We got to mention no Portfolio Rescue next week because Duncan and I will be in Miami
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.680]   recording a live edition of Animal Spirits that if we figured out, can hopefully go up
