[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   Our first question comes from Ryan.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.820]   Ryan says, I'm a university professor and a comic artist.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.220]   I'm getting ready to launch my upcoming book on Kickstarter on New Year's day.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.740]   All right.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.780]   So that's a little bit of a reveal that this question was submitted a little
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.160]   while ago, because we were recording this in March and he's talking about New Year's
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.960]   day, um, moving on though, Ryan says in an effort to get the word out, I'm
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.480]   planning a big online tour in which I'm talking with different, a different
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.700]   media outlet every day of my month long campaign, my question is, I fear that
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.260]   I may be devoting too much time to promoting the release rather than
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.540]   finishing the book, my comic is almost complete, only two more pages to go,
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.740]   but I'd really like to have it done by the launch.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.760]   Any tips for prioritizing that deep cartooning work in the face of trying
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.540]   to make big noise about my upcoming project?
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.300]   Well, Ryan, it's a good question because I want you to be very
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.420]   wary of the publicity marketing.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.620]   It is an easy trap, a seductive trap for those that are producing commercial
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.700]   creative products to allow your energy to be increasingly drawn towards
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.560]   strategies for getting the word out.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.340]   Now, the reason why it's so seductive is because it presents a completely
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060]   different type of challenge than actually producing creative output.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.520]   It's a challenge that is not trivial, but it's very tractable.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.840]   It's what I used to call checklist productivity, where you can go online
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.240]   and take an internet marketing course and follow some podcast of internet
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.800]   marketers and figure out a checklist, do this, this, this, and this, and feel
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.920]   like you have some insider knowledge that the normal person won't do, but
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   it's also consistently executable steps.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.860]   Make these calls, do this with your website, set up a funnel this way.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.000]   So it's very fulfilling.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.880]   It takes effort and it feels like it's insider information, but you know,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.200]   for a fact you can get it done.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.040]   Checklist productivity is incredibly seductive because there's never this
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.700]   moment of I'm just stuck, I'm trying to produce something new.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.040]   I don't know if it's good or not.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.760]   I could fail.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.060]   I could produce something and it's bad.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.840]   I couldn't have an idea.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.960]   Checklist productivity, you can always get through.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.040]   Writers, cartoonists, artists get very seduced by this because man, that's
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.940]   so much more appealing than actually producing writing or producing
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.380]   cartoons or producing art because it's tractable, check, check, check.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.960]   You check off the check boxes as you go.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.320]   So I want you to be careful, Ryan, that you're not allowing your time to
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.700]   be increasingly consumed by these marketing publicity plans because it's
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.240]   fun, because it's better, it's easier, more fulfilling in the moment
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.520]   than actually trying to draw cartoons.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.660]   Now it's not to say that stuff doesn't matter, but what I typically talk
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.100]   about is that when it comes to creative output, the number one thing you
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.500]   have to do is be so good you can't be ignored, you have to produce stuff
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.600]   that is of really high quality.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.960]   You got to do that.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.480]   That's the core.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.160]   Without that, with a few exceptions of internet influencer weirdness, you're
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.680]   never going to get somewhere that far.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.020]   That's where your attention has to be.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.780]   And then you want some sort of reasonable publicity marketing plan based
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.920]   on what you have available that helps try to spread the word, but if you
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.520]   don't have something to spread the word about, it doesn't matter.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.100]   So you almost want to confine the marketing publicity to like here
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.740]   are reasonable, tested things to do.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.240]   Here's when I'm going to do this work.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.040]   I put it in a box, I'll execute that.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.120]   It's a three week period.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.240]   But what I really care about is the production.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.920]   So in your case, I would say you need some cartoonish equivalent
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.500]   of the John McPhee method.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.280]   And by the John McPhee method, I'm referring to an essay I published on
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   my blog and newsletter recently, where I talked about on the occasion of
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.520]   John McPhee's birthday, his method of writing, which is 500 words a day.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.140]   That's not a lot of words for a particular day, but as he says, you
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.940]   keep doing that and over time, you're going to produce quite a bit of work.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.020]   And he has 29 books, a Pulitzer, two national book awards nominations.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.440]   So you need whatever your equivalent is as a cartoonist is what I'd
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.100]   recommend of 500 words a day.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.280]   And the reason why I'm going for that tractable amount of words is
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.620]   because you're a university professor.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.940]   This is not the only thing you're doing.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.500]   And I would do it first thing in the morning.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.300]   And I don't know what that's going to take for cartooning.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.500]   Is it a panel a day, three panels a day?
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.860]   I don't know the pacing, but basically like 60 to 90 minutes of work.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.620]   And I would just make that an unviolatable core of your day.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.560]   You just do that every single day.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.620]   The marketing publicity stuff that has to compete with all of your
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.260]   other university responsibilities.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.580]   You're, you know, you try to fit it in where you can, and you have to
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.020]   use some weekend and evenings, maybe like that has to compete with your
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.140]   syllabuses and faculty meetings and everything else you're doing.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.940]   But the core is my 500 words a day, my creative production at my creative
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.780]   peak, not a ton every day, but enough that you look back over a month.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.980]   Hey, I produced a good amount.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.940]   You look back over a year.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.600]   You say, I'm very impressed by what I did.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.740]   You look back over a career and you say, I've been a pretty productive artist.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.440]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.420]   Go to this core of deep creative work that never, you don't violate.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.740]   The publicity marketing stuff, get that done as you can have
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.300]   a plan, but keep it reasonable.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.060]   No one ever made themselves a long-term sustainable career as a
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.120]   respected creative do solely or primarily to publicity, it's always,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   always come down to producing stuff that people can't ignore.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.460]   The publicity marketing is all just about a Delta on how long it takes
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.700]   people to actually discover it.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.620]   [MUSIC]
