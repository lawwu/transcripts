[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   I mean, the effects of that decision they made to stop trading.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.840]   And specifically, they didn't stop people from selling.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.600]   They only stopped people from buying.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.760]   So they shut down one side of the trade.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.500]   And the effect of that was we had these hedge funds from Wall Street.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.220]   They were on the ropes, right?
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.980]   I mean, let's discuss who these guys are.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.960]   These are the apex predators of Wall Street.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.220]   They are in the business of shorting companies to destroy them.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.700]   I mean, that is their business model.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.000]   And they are not academic traders, OK, who are just speculating on outcome.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.440]   They engineer the outcome, right?
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.680]   Look at their tactics.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.240]   Just watch the show Billions, right?
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.520]   They hire PR people.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.480]   They hire private investigators.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.680]   They're participating on these message boards spreading disinformation.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.240]   Look at the year of hell that Elon went through, right?
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.300]   They tried to destroy Tesla.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.160]   It's like five years.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.560]   They tried to destroy companies to engineer that outcome.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.580]   They create nothing.
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.380]   They're in the business of destruction.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.820]   Now.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.780]   The beautiful thing is you had these Reddit kids, these pirates who published this manifesto,
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.040]   right, on Reddit, basically being the heirs to occupy Wall Street.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.960]   They recognize, look, occupying like a physical space does nothing to these guys.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.880]   We are going to hurt them where it counts in their pocketbook.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.640]   We are going to get together and we're going to basically create a trade mob that's even
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.860]   bigger than their cartel.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.740]   And they did.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.860]   They got 2.7 million people taking the other side of this trade.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.420]   And then when the hedge funds doubled down,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.540]   they said, fuck you, we're going to double, we're going to triple down.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.400]   And the guy on Reddit said, listen, paraphrasing John Maynard, Kane said,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.080]   we can be retarded longer than you can be solvent.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.320]   And they were winning.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.980]   That was what they said.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.220]   Right.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.580]   And they were winning the trade.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.040]   Okay.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.360]   And Melvin was dead busted and Citron was on its way to being dead busted.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.480]   And they had to go to big Papa, Stevie Cohn.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.220]   Okay.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.300]   And Ken Griffin to get, to get their rebuys to buy their rebuys to get back into the game.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.860]   Okay.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.600]   And then they had these guys on the ropes.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.680]   They had them felted.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.180]   Okay.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.120]   And then what happens just at the moment where they're going to like basically bust them
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.540]   out of the game for good.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.840]   Robin hood shuts down the buy side of the trade.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.120]   And so what does that do?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.540]   It gives these hedge funds time to regroup, to unspool the tray, to reposition and save
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.460]   themselves and to get out of the trade.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.200]   If they want to get out of the trade, you can never take that 24 hour time period back,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.040]   no matter what Robin hood does now.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.840]   Hey everyone.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.440]   Hey everyone.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.480]   Welcome to the all in pod.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.200]   A billion here, a billion there.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.660]   Pretty soon.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.800]   You're talking about real money.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.740]   I love you, Saks.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.760]   These are really big numbers.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.900]   Is spread the opportunity that technology represents.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.080]   We're probably going to have four Kardashians on there.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.780]   So four besties on there.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.780]   Yeah.
