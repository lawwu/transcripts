[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I would remind you that we are still looking at this first section in the third chapter
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.240]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans, the section that runs from the first verse to the eighth
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.760]   verse, and I'd better perhaps read it again.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.520]   What advantage then hath the Jew, or what profit is there of circumcision?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.440]   Much every way; chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.520]   Now that's the point at which we had arrived at the end last Friday, so we really take
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.040]   up at the beginning of the third verse this evening.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.240]   For what if some did not believe?
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.000]   Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.560]   God forbid; yea, let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, that thou mightest
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.140]   be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.200]   But if our unrighteousness commit the righteousness of God, what shall we say?
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.080]   Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.360]   I speak as a man.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360]   God forbid.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   For then how shall God judge the world?
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.160]   For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why yet am
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.920]   I also judged as a sinner?
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.440]   And not rather, as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say, let us do
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.200]   evil that good may come, whose damnation is just.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.000]   Now I think it is generally agreed that that is one of the most difficult passages, not
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.360]   only in this epistle to the Romans, but in the whole of Scripture.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.440]   You notice that it is a very fine, very closely woven argument.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.720]   And some may be inclined to ask, well, is all this sort of thing necessary?
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.900]   Why all this subtle argument?
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.160]   Why does the apostle bother with this kind of thing which is so difficult to follow and
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640]   to understand?
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   The answer is, of course, that the fault is not the apostle Paul's.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.320]   He had no desire to write like this, I am perfectly certain, and probably dearly wished
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.920]   that it were unnecessary for him to write like this.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, why does he do so?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.480]   Well, he does so because he has to do so, and he has to do so because of the questions
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.080]   people ask, because of the arguments people put up.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.800]   And as a wise teacher and as one who is anxious, as he has already told them that these Christians
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.280]   in Rome should be well grounded and established in the faith, well, he has to meet all possible
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.560]   arguments and all kinds of eventualities.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.600]   Paul as a preacher had had experiences like every other preacher has.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.140]   He makes a statement which he thinks is perfectly plain and clear, but it seems to arrive at
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.880]   the receiving end in a somewhat different manner.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.960]   And people put an odd twist to it, and they say, "If this is so, well then, what about
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   this?"
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.140]   And they begin to ask their questions.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.600]   And it was because people had been doing things like that with the apostle.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.840]   You notice how he complains here.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:38.040]   In the eighth verse he says, "As we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say."
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.500]   Now, I'm not sure that those words I've just read in brackets are not the most comforting
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.960]   words for any preacher in this congregation tonight of any words in the whole of Scripture.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.360]   The apostle Paul's preaching was completely misunderstood by certain people, and they
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.200]   made him say the exact opposite of what he was actually saying.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Very well.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.000]   Now then, here I say he is driven to this bit of argumentation.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Let us consider it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.520]   Let me try to put it as clearly as I can to you, though I again repeat, it's an extremely
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.000]   difficult statement, a very difficult argument to follow.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.880]   Now what is he dealing with?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.240]   Well, here is the position.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.080]   In view of what he's been saying in chapter two, that there is no difference between the
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.320]   Jew and the Gentile in the matter of the wrath and the judgment of God.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.480]   People were asking, especially the Jews, "Well, very well.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.800]   If that is so, what's the point of being a Jew?
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.980]   Why was the Old Testament ever necessary?
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.800]   Why did God ever call Abraham and separate him from all the others?"
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   Because God chose Abraham.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.200]   When Abraham was a pagan, God chose him and called him out.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.680]   It wasn't Abraham's choice, it was God's choice.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.120]   And God, out of that one man, produced a nation for himself.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.160]   And he said to them, "You only have I known of all the nations of the earth."
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.720]   That's the great story of the Old Testament.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.600]   "Well now," says someone, "indeed, in view of what you've just been saying in this second
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.320]   chapter, you seem to be dismissing the whole of that, and you say there's no point of it."
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.120]   Not at all, says one.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.200]   You remember, we looked at it last Friday.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   Much every way there's a great advantage.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   What is it?
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.640]   Well, the chief thing is this, that unto them were entrusted, committed, the oracles of
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:41.760]   God, God's Word, God's promises, God's teaching, God's Word in the Old Testament in all its
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   fullness.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.580]   All right, the apostle lays that down.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.240]   And then immediately he foresees another difficulty.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.640]   He foresees people raising a query out of what he's just been saying.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.000]   He's been saying to them there is a tremendous advantage in being a Jew, and there was throughout
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.760]   the centuries, because to them were given these oracles, these great promises about
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.180]   the coming of the Messiah, and so on.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.240]   And then he imagines a man saying, "Ah, wait a minute, that doesn't help at all.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.600]   That isn't an answer.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.400]   That doesn't satisfy me."
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.960]   Why not?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.740]   Well, for this reason.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:34.800]   The Jews, speaking generally as a nation, had proved unfaithful to God's Word, and had
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.960]   never really understood his promises, and especially when the Messiah actually came,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   the bulk of the nation refused him and rejected him, as the apostle was well aware, and as
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.280]   he deals with in chapters 9, 10, and 11, later on of this selfsame epistle.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.560]   So that the argument that he now envisages is this, and no doubt it was an argument that
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.640]   had frequently been brought forward, can be put in this form.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.000]   It's no use saying that the advantage to the Jew was that to them had been entrusted the
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.720]   oracles of God, because the oracles of God don't seem to have benefited them.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:28.360]   Their unbelief, their lack of faithfulness, has surely nullified and negated all the value
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.880]   of God's promises.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.040]   Now that's the statement which he makes in verse 3.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.200]   He puts it in the form of a question, you see, "For what if some did not believe?"
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.440]   Here we must point out, with all the learned commentators, what a careful man the apostle
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.840]   was, what a diplomatic man he was in many senses, and it's a point worth noting.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.220]   He says, "What if some did not believe," giving the impression that the great majority
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.760]   of the Jews had believed, but that some had not, whereas the actual fact was that the
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.420]   vast majority had not believed, and there was only a very small remnant that did believe.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:16.640]   But you notice how diplomatic he is, how always he's courteous.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.020]   You'll find examples of that as you read the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.160]   You remember the famous occasion when he addressed King Agrippa and so on.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.360]   Well, you just read the introduction to his address and notice how the apostle does everything
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.000]   he can to make his argument commendable and to be as pleasing as he can.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.800]   He's all things to all men that he might by all means gain some, and so on.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.760]   Well, here's an instance of that.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:52.080]   What if some have not believed, whereas in reality, I say, it was the majority?
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.720]   Now the translation here is again a great cause of debate, it doesn't seem to me to
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.480]   matter very much.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.400]   What if some did not believe, says this authorised?
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.960]   Perhaps a better translation would be to say, what if some were not faithful, faithful to
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:17.520]   the promises, faithful to the word that had been delivered to them?
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.240]   What if some of them did not do so?
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:31.920]   Does that mean then that God's faithfulness in his promises is made without effect?
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.940]   Now that's the third verse.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.760]   What if some were not faithful?
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:44.640]   Shall their lack of faith, their unfaithfulness make the faithfulness of God of none effect?
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.040]   Now that's the position that he is now taking up.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:58.160]   In other words, we shall see as we work through this paragraph, that he deals with three possible
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.200]   arguments that people may raise on the statement which he makes in the first two verses.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.120]   I say, no doubt that oftentimes the three arguments had rarely been produced.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.240]   Here is the first.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.160]   And it seems, therefore, that the unfaithfulness of the nation of Israel has rarely done away
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.640]   with all the benefit and the value of having the oracles of God.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.720]   It doesn't seem to have led to anything.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.520]   It didn't seem to lead to anything in the old dispensation.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:32.920]   It doesn't seem to lead to anything now with the coming of the Lord and this new dispensation.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.680]   Very well, what is his answer to that?
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.980]   Well, here it is in verse four.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.920]   He starts with a statement which is translated here in the Authorized as, "God forbid."
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.720]   Now actually, that's a very poor translation because in the original, the word "God" doesn't
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.420]   appear at all.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:11:04.200]   So that we must realize that it means "out upon the suggestion," "impossible suggestion,"
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.040]   "unthinkable."
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.080]   Why is it unthinkable?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.840]   Well, the answer is given in the rest of the verse.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:21.360]   "Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written," and then he quotes out
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:28.240]   of the 51st Psalm, "that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.760]   when thou art judged."
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.100]   Now what is chiefly, I believe, of importance to us is to observe the apostolic method.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.440]   He states the question.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.240]   Then his first answer, invariably, is, "This is an impossible suggestion, it's unthinkable."
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240]   Why?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.020]   Well, on general principles, as I'm going to show you.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.860]   But then having laid it down like that, he then comes and looks at it a little bit more
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860]   in detail.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.800]   He elaborates it a little for us.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.000]   Now the essence of his answer is really this.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:18.520]   The failure of the Jews does not and cannot in any way affect the purposes or the faithfulness
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.720]   of God.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.880]   God gave his promises.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.520]   He gave them to the Jews, and to the Jews only at first.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:34.120]   Now the failure of the Jews to take it and to receive it and to appreciate it makes not
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.400]   the slightest difference to God's promise.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.080]   That's what he's really saying.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.560]   That is the essence of his argument.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:50.360]   He says, "Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect, or shall their unfaithfulness
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.020]   nullify the faithfulness of God?
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.880]   By no means, be it not so.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.600]   It is quite unthinkable."
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.360]   Now here, of course, is one of those tremendous principles which we must take a firm grasp
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.640]   of, and we can look at it in this way.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:21.000]   God's unconditional promises do not depend upon the faithfulness of men.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.400]   Indeed, were they to do so, there would never have been a salvation at all.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.280]   Now that is, in a sense, the great message of the Old Testament.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.480]   Here is God, he's chosen this people, he's made this people for himself.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.840]   He gives them all these promises, he treats them in grace, and yet look at their constant
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.520]   and repeated failure, failure after failure after failure.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:52.120]   And if it had been left to them, well, the nation might very well have been exterminated,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.160]   and none of the promises of God would have been brought to pass or would have had any
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.400]   effect.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:07.800]   But it is in spite of them that God goes on with his great purposes and fulfills his wonderful
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   covenant.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:17.440]   Now, this, I say, is a very important principle for us to lay hold of.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.160]   What God has purposed, God will most surely bring to pass.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:32.240]   He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.800]   I know of no doctrine that is more comforting in this world this evening than just that.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.520]   Take the Christian church herself.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.340]   If the Christian church had been a human institution only, it's perfectly certain that she would
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.080]   have ceased to be centuries ago.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:56.440]   It is in spite not only of the attacks of the enemy from the outside, it is in spite
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:03.000]   of the failure of the church herself that the church has still persisted and has gone
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.440]   on, it is because it is the purpose of God.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:17.240]   Now then, the apostle puts it like this, you see, very strongly, "Let God be true, and
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:24.880]   let every man be a liar."
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.160]   God's faithfulness and God's justice is absolute.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.200]   He just lays it down as a principle.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:41.640]   He says if all men were completely to fail, God's veracity, God's truth, God's righteousness,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.280]   God's purposes would still be right.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.320]   That's his declaration.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.520]   He says that this sort of question is a question which should never be raised, in other words.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:00.800]   You must never ask this question, "Is it the case that because so-and-so has happened
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.560]   or because people have not done this or that, does it therefore mean that God's great purpose
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   is nullified?"
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.160]   Now, says the apostle, if you ask a question like that, it means that your whole thinking
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.400]   about God is wrong.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.680]   God is never wrong.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   God cannot be wrong.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.320]   "Let the whole world be wrong, but not God.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.160]   Let God be true, but every man a liar."
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.400]   That's how he puts it, and he puts it very strongly.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.640]   And indeed, he goes on and adds this.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:41.200]   Here we come to the quotation, you see, from Psalm 51.4, which in the authorized version
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.800]   reads like this, "David, you remember, had committed that terrible sin of his in the
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:54.360]   matter of Bathsheba and in the murder of her husband.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.080]   And then, you remember, he went on imagining that all was well, but then God visited him
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   through the prophet Nathan, and at first David didn't like it, and God dealt with him very
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   severely.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:13.480]   At last, David came to see it all, and he writes his 51st Psalm, and this is what he
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:21.680]   says in verse 4, "Against thee, the only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.880]   that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest."
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.000]   But you notice the apostle doesn't put it exactly like that.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.400]   Why not?
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:40.800]   Well, the apostle's quotation, as most of his quotations in his epistles from the Old
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:49.520]   Testament, is taken from the Septuagint, which was so commonly used at that particular time.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:55.520]   You remember that Greek translation of the Old Testament that had been done by the Seventy.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.120]   Paul's quotations are almost invariably from the Seventy, and what we have here is a direct
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.400]   quotation of Psalm 51.4 in that particular version.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.240]   But of course, the message rarely comes to much the same thing, and what it means is
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   this.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.120]   David, in effect, is saying, "Now there was a moment when I thought that you were
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.420]   wrong and that I didn't deserve this punishment.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.000]   I felt this wasn't right and this wasn't fair.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.960]   I am thy servant and thou has called me," and so on, "and I began to feel that it was
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.600]   wrong that I should be treated in this way."
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:41.320]   The Jews often argued like that, but David now has been enlightened, he has come to himself.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.800]   And here he puts it quite simply and plainly.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.640]   He says, "I have sinned, and I haven't a single plea, and what you have done to me
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.420]   and what you are doing to me is perfectly right.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.360]   I justify your action.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.680]   I want it to be made known and clear," says David, "that you are absolutely right and
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.000]   just in all you are doing."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.560]   And the apostle here takes up this quotation, and you notice it's a very apposite quotation.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.640]   He says, "Whatever men may do, what God does is always right.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.880]   Yes, though the whole world were wrong, God is still right.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.920]   Let God be true, but every man a liar."
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:30.800]   Indeed he says, as David has put it, "God is always right, and history will justify
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.600]   God that thou mightest overcome when thou art judged."
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.040]   It's a very bold picture.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:44.640]   It's a picture, as it were, of God on trial, mankind querying and questioning God.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.800]   "No, no," says David, "when the ultimate facts are revealed, God will be justified.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:57.240]   The world will have to admit, as I am having to admit now, that God is right and that I
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   alone was wrong."
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.300]   Now that's exactly what the apostle is here saying.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:14.160]   So that you see, we can actually put it like this, that the apostle's argument is working
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.000]   up to this climax.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.400]   Not only does the failure of the Jews not nullify the purpose of God, the failure of
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:35.520]   the Jews indeed seems to put out into greater relief and into greater prominence the justice
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.000]   and the righteousness and the truth of God's way.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.320]   "You go back to your Old Testament," says Paul, "and if you read it properly, this
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.200]   is the conclusion you'll come to."
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   Not so much that the failure of the Jews has brought God's purpose to nothing, but that
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.040]   in spite of the failure of the Jews, God's purpose still goes on.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:06.760]   So that you see, the failure of the Jews exaggerates, emphasizes, throws into greater relief the
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:13.360]   righteousness and the justice and the perfection of God's way.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.560]   Very well, there we've arrived at the first argument, and that is the right way, he tells
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.800]   us, to look at this failure on the part of the Jews.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:33.720]   But then, you see, that leads to yet another argument, and oh, how subtle is the sinner!
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.120]   How clever he thinks he is, he raises now an argument on that statement, and this is
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   it.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:48.280]   "Oh well," says this imaginary opponent, "if you are saying that our unrighteousness commends
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:55.480]   the righteousness of God and makes it stand out still more gloriously, what shall we say?
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.440]   Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?"
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.560]   Do you follow the argument?
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.480]   Well, let me put it to you in my own words like this.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:16.120]   If you've just said that the unrighteousness or the failure of the Jews makes this glorious
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.720]   righteousness of God stand out still more marvelously, well, why does he punish them
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   then?
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:30.000]   If their very failure has sort of contributed to His majesty and His glory and His greatness,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.320]   on what grounds is he punishing them?
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.800]   And you've been trying to prove to us that they are going to be punished, as the Gentiles
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   are going to be punished.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.360]   Well, how can he punish people who are magnifying His righteousness and His grace and His glory?
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.800]   Isn't that being unfair?
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.880]   Now, that's their question.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.080]   Now, you notice the apostle is very careful in the way he puts this.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.840]   He slips into brackets there at the end of that verse, "I speak as a man."
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.400]   What he means by that is this.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.560]   He says, "This is the way in which the natural man argues."
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.480]   Now, there's a very modern ring about these arguments, isn't there?
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.000]   Haven't you heard people doing that when they're given the gospel?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.520]   They try to catch you on every word you say, "If this, then that."
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.160]   Now, that's exactly the argument that the apostle is here meeting.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:24.960]   And of course, many of the rabbis, the Pharisees and others, in the very time of our Lord and
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.460]   Paul, really did use that very argument.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:37.560]   They said, "God cannot justly punish Israel because the very failure of Israel has brought
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:47.000]   out more clearly than ever before the righteousness and the majesty of God's way and God's purpose."
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:57.600]   Now, this is, I say, a typical argument from the side of the unbeliever.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.800]   He says, "You know, you can't have it both ways.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:10.160]   If you say that my sin and my failure brings out in a wonderful way the mercy and the compassion
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:18.840]   of God, well, surely then, that very mercy and compassion of God must forgive this sin."
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.360]   Now, let me put that in modern language.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.640]   The evangelical preaching of the gospel is to this effect, isn't it?
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.720]   That we are saved without money and without price.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.640]   I stand in this pulpit and I say, "If there's somebody listening to me who's come from the
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:40.200]   very jaws of hell and has spent a lifetime in sin, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.280]   You have been forgiven freely by the grace of God."
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.960]   And I say, "How wonderful is that grace!
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.000]   The more sin abounded, the more did grace superabound, as it were."
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.880]   "Oh, very well," says the sinner.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.560]   "If that is so, then, well, if this grace of God is as great and as marvelous and as
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:08.960]   wonderful as that, how does it become possible that God should ever punish at all?"
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.880]   Now, that's the question which he puts here in verse 5.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.680]   What is the answer to this?
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:23.080]   Well, the answer is given in verse 6, and again, it's exactly the same, "God forbid."
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.720]   It's an impossible suggestion.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.160]   It must never be put up as a supposition.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.600]   "You should never have used such language," says the apostle.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   It's one of those things that should never be uttered, impossible.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.160]   But then he doesn't stop at that.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.640]   He goes on again to give his further reason, and here it is, and he regards this as being
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   sufficient.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:52.120]   He says, "If that is so, how then shall God judge the world?"
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.640]   Now, this is a brilliant bit of argumentation in this way.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.840]   The apostle knew that the Jews did believe in the final judgment.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.640]   They all did believe that.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.680]   They believed that God was going to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.920]   Of course, what they believed was that they would be all right.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.520]   They would not be judged, but the Gentiles would.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.760]   The world would, and it would be judged because of its sin.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:25.880]   "Very well," says the apostle, "don't you see where you've landed yourselves?
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:35.960]   If you are now going to argue that this unrighteousness of men, which brings out into greater relief
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:44.640]   the righteousness of God, always means that God therefore cannot judge sin and punish
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:51.080]   it, how do you at the same time teach that God is going to judge the sin of the Gentiles
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.200]   at the end of the world?
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.680]   Because surely the unrighteousness of these Gentiles makes the righteousness of God stand
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.000]   out in relief in exactly the same way as does that of the Jews."
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.280]   In other words, he's proving to them that they've gone too far.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.480]   They've proved too much.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.920]   If what they are trying to argue there is true, even the Gentiles can't be judged, and
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.880]   they believe the Gentiles would be judged, so that it's a final and a conclusive argument.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:29.240]   If that is right, says the apostle, well then, God will not be able to judge anybody at the
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.580]   end of the age, at the end of the world.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:41.100]   But wait a moment, he must go still further, and here we come to verse 7, where he now
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.880]   puts it in a more personal form, "For if the truth of God hath more abounded through
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.240]   my lie unto his glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.580]   Now this isn't the third question, this is a subdivision of the second.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.640]   The second is put in general, first of all.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:07.200]   He says if in general unrighteousness of men brings out and magnifies the righteousness
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.600]   of God, now he puts it personally, he says, "Here am I as a sinner.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:22.620]   And if my sin has made the truth of God stand out more abundantly, well why am I also then
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:30.720]   at the same time judged as a sinner?"
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.040]   And here he doesn't give an immediate answer, if of course the fact is that he's already
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:42.440]   answered it in what he said in general in verse 6, where he says the end of that argument
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.840]   is that nobody can ever be judged, and that at the end of the world nobody will be condemned
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.160]   at all, everybody will be saved, and God will smile indiscriminately upon all kinds and
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.280]   conditions of men.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:05.240]   But instead of repeating his own argument, he goes on and puts it in a slightly different
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.480]   way in verse 8.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:14.960]   And here is again a most important statement, "And not rather," you see he's continuing
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:22.780]   it, "then as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say, 'Let us do
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.720]   evil that good may come,'" what's it mean?
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:35.320]   Well, let me put it in this form, "You are saying to me," says the apostle, "If this
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:45.160]   sin of mine makes the righteousness and the truth and the glory of God stand out still
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.600]   more gloriously, why should I therefore be punished?"
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.920]   Now, "Wait a minute," says Paul, "You ought to go further than that, and you ought to
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:02.600]   say this, 'Wouldn't it be a good thing, therefore, if I sinned still more?'"
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.520]   Because according to what you are saying, the more I sin, the more does the grace and
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.840]   the mercy of God shine out.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:16.260]   Now, you'll find that the apostle repeats this kind of argument many times in the body
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.600]   of this epistle.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.000]   He has said it, he goes on to say it very explicitly in the fifth chapter, where he
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.600]   says, "Where sin abounded, grace doth much more abound."
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:37.240]   Now, people were misunderstanding that, and they were saying slanderously, as Paul says,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:43.740]   that the apostle was teaching this, "The more we sin, the more God's grace will shine
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.560]   out, therefore, there's no need to attempt to live a good life, there's no need for us
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.640]   to bother about the law, the worse we are, the greater will be God's mercy to us, therefore,
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.720]   let us plunge into sin, that the grace of God may abound toward us."
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.160]   "Why don't you say that?" says the apostle.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.120]   And you see, then he puts it in brackets, he says, "You know, some people are actually
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.240]   saying that I and the other evangelists are preaching that."
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.740]   Now, that is what makes this argument a little bit difficult, that the apostle should put
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:20.260]   the two things together in this rather strange and difficult construction.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:25.980]   But that is the argument, and it's a perfectly fair argument.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:40.060]   If the argument is that because our sin produces more marvelously than ever the grace of God,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:49.340]   that therefore, God will not punish sin, well, it's quite logical to say, the more you sin,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.980]   therefore, the greater will be the righteousness of God.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:58.220]   That's the point, says the apostle, at which you land yourselves.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.620]   And what is his comment upon it?
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:05.220]   His comment is this, "Whose damnation is just.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:13.020]   Any man who couldn't say, 'Let us do evil that good may come,' well, there's no defense
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.600]   for him.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.380]   His damnation is just.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.900]   He is violating every moral principle.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.260]   He is committing moral and intellectual suicide.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.980]   There is nothing that is too bad for such a person.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.720]   His damnation is just."
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.620]   Very well, there I have taken you through the three arguments.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.500]   You see the arguments?
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:44.860]   The first is, "All right, you say that the giving of the oracles of God to these people
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.900]   was a great privilege, it was a wonderful thing for them.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.380]   How can you say that in view of their failure?
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:57.420]   Doesn't their failure prove that the oracles were of no value at all?"
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:03.580]   The answer is no, and the answer is no because in spite of their failure, what God has promised
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.300]   and purposed will be carried out.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.820]   Now, you notice that in chapters 9, 10, and 11, he takes this thing in much greater detail.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.100]   Here is the essence of it.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:21.720]   "Actually, there was at that very time a remnant according to the election of grace."
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:27.660]   And the apostle there proves that they are not all Israel, that they are of Israel.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.480]   There is a division in this big classification of Israel.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.260]   There is a true Israel and a false Israel.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:39.140]   Paul himself is one of the Israelites who have realized the privilege and have got the
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   benefit.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:46.220]   There is a remnant according to the election of grace.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.780]   And there are yet other things to happen.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:56.100]   So that you see, that argument falls to the ground, to the extent even of our being able
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:02.860]   to say this, that this failure of Israel, far from making it of no effect, has really
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.300]   brought it out in a still more wonderful way.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:12.780]   All right then, the second argument, "Doesn't that mean, therefore, that God is wrong when
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.980]   he punishes sin, if you say that the effect of sin is to make his grace shine out more
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.980]   gloriously?"
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.020]   Again, it's a kind of thing that should never be said, says the apostle.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:27.980]   And if in that case, how can God judge the world at all?
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.020]   And indeed, he says, "You better be careful what you're saying."
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:38.980]   If you were going to say that because God's grace and love and mercy shine out in contrast
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:45.980]   to sin, that God therefore cannot punish sin, well, why not go to the logical conclusion
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.580]   and say, "Let's sin as much as we can."
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.860]   Because our sinning seems to be recommending God's grace and draws it out and makes it
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.860]   still brighter.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.300]   Well, let's plunge into sin.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.540]   "Do you realize what you're saying?" says the apostle.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.860]   It's unthinkable.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:11.640]   And a man who says a thing like that is a man whose condemnation is just.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.980]   And so, you see, he has dealt with the arguments which have been put forward, and so at the
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:22.180]   beginning of verse 9, as we trust we shall see next Friday, having disposed of all these
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.840]   arguments, he comes right back and says, "What then?
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.240]   Are we better than they?
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   Are we Jews better than the Gentiles?
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:34.900]   Know ye no wise, for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.900]   sin."
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:41.300]   He's back again at the end of chapter 2, and he's now going to prove it by his great demonstrations
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.460]   from the scriptures themselves.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.740]   But that will be our theme next Friday.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:54.900]   All I want to do in a moment now is to draw certain lessons for ourselves from these verses
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.700]   we've been considering tonight, and to me it's of tremendous importance.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.460]   Here's the first thing.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:09.620]   Sometimes I'm afraid we modern Christians tend to think that it is we alone who have
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:17.100]   these struggles against unbelievers, that the early church lived a kind of lyrical,
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.420]   delightful kind of life with no opposition, no difficulties at all.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.660]   My dear friends, it's quite the reverse.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.060]   This great apostle was having to argue constantly.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.480]   His preaching was misunderstood.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.460]   The Jews with their subtle arguments were trying to catch him and to trip him.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.340]   You know they did exactly the same with our Lord.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.300]   You remember how they came with the tribute money, should we pay tribute unto Caesar or
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.300]   not?
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.460]   They tried to trip him and to catch him on words.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.540]   They were constantly trying to do it.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.740]   The early church had to fight for her life, fight for her faith.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:58.540]   She was surrounded by all these subtle argumentations, and they had to be met.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:04.660]   Thank God the apostle and others were thus led to meet them.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:11.460]   You notice that in those days men tried to be clever even as they try to be clever now?
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.260]   You all must have had that experience as Christian people.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.940]   When you've been putting the faith, putting the position to somebody, haven't you often
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:24.420]   noticed how rarely they don't seem to be listening to the truth that you're putting to them,
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.460]   but they're trying to catch you and to trip you on words.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.340]   They're chopping logic with you, and they're trying to show that you're contradicting
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.340]   yourself somehow.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.780]   That's the very thing they did with the apostle Paul.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.220]   Don't be discouraged, my friends.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.540]   Don't be stumbled by that.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.020]   Don't be discouraged.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.940]   The world has always done that.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.660]   It's a characteristic of unbelief.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.580]   But now I come to a third and a very general principle, which I think applies to all of
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.540]   us.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:38:01.100]   How careful we must be when we speak and express our opinions about things that we do not fully
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.940]   understand, and especially about God and his ways.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:15.180]   Now I say this applies to us all, because unless when perhaps we are chastised or when
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.380]   we are passing through a difficult time, we, like these Jews and others, are a little bit
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:25.220]   prone to ask our questions, we say, "No, I don't quite see why God..."
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.980]   That's the very thing that the apostle says, "God forbid."
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.060]   You don't see.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.060]   Very well.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:41.980]   If you don't see, be very careful not to speak in such a way as to blaspheme the name
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   of God.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.220]   Be careful.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.600]   Put your hand on your mouth, as Job puts it.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:54.900]   Be very careful in expressing your opinion about God's ways.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:02.260]   You may not see it all at a glance, but swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.460]   That is always the rule.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.220]   Then number four, here is a very valuable and a practical point.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:15.660]   How are we to deal with these arguments that are put up against us?
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.260]   What are we to do with these people who have their subtle, clever arguments and say, "If
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.420]   this, well, what about that?"
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.620]   Well, now, you notice the apostolic method.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.540]   It's a very wonderful one, and a very safe one.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:36.060]   In each instance, he doesn't start with details, but he falls back on some great fundamental
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.980]   principle.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.340]   You notice his three principles.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.900]   With regard to the first question, his answer is this, "God forbid, why?"
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   "Well," he says, "you're querying the faithfulness of God."
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.780]   Now that is something which must be never done.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.820]   Can I put it like this to you?
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:04.260]   When you're tackling or trying to solve a difficult problem, it is always a good and
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:10.700]   a wise thing to start with something about which you're absolutely certain.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.700]   When you've got the unknown, start with the known.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.380]   If you're involved in some difficult argumentation and details, now the wise thing always to
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.380]   do is this.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:25.980]   Say, "Now, is there some big principle about which I'm absolutely certain, which is related
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.980]   to these details?"
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.820]   If there is, go for it, lay it down.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.780]   So the apostle is saying this, in effect.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:38.740]   He says, "Whatever the detailed reply may be to you of this, I am absolutely certain.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:43.340]   Nothing can affect or change the faithfulness of God.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.060]   God is always faithful."
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:54.100]   Then his second great principle is this one, "God is ever-righteous."
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.420]   When they bring up this question, "Is God righteous in judging?"
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.300]   Now, he says, "Whatever the detailed answer may be about that of this, I'm certain.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.300]   Everything God does is righteous, everything.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.780]   You must never query the faithfulness of God.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.860]   You must never query the righteousness of God."
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.860]   So if you ever catch yourself putting a question or making a statement that seems to bring
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:23.380]   these two great things into doubt, you will at once know that you're wrong.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:28.420]   And if you're dealing with somebody else who's doing that, say, "Now, wait a minute, can't
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:36.340]   you see that what you are implying is that God's eternal purpose can somehow be deflected?
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.340]   That's impossible.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.740]   He'd no longer be God."
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.260]   Or secondly, in the second difficulty, "Can't you see that what you are querying is the
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:49.700]   absolute righteousness of God and the justice of God?"
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.180]   You must never do that.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.500]   These are absolutes.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.060]   These are not for discussion.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.020]   God is not God unless these things are always true.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:03.740]   And finally, you see, if ever you seem to be saying something which leads to the conclusion,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:10.620]   "Let us do evil that good may come," well, already you know that you're wrong.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.140]   That's morally impossible.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.380]   It's unthinkable therefore.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:20.460]   Well, now, there it is, and I commend this great method of argumentation to you.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:26.060]   Seek for the principle involved in the argument that is put to you, then fall back upon one
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:32.540]   of these fundamental postulates, stand there, and then explain the difficulty in terms of
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.540]   that.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.780]   That's exactly what the apostle does.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:41.240]   One other word is this.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:52.060]   A very good way of testing any view that you may hold is this one, "Is this view humbling
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.700]   to me, glorifying to God?"
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.540]   If it is, it's probably right.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:06.420]   You won't go far wrong if whatever view you are holding is glorifying to God, humbling
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.740]   to man.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:14.380]   But if your view seems to glorify you and to query God, well, there's no need to argue
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.640]   or to go into details.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.780]   It's wrong.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.500]   It's a very good universal rule then.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:26.860]   And my last word of all is again a word primarily to preachers.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:32.500]   Indeed, it's a word to everybody in the sense that if ever you are putting the gospel to
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.260]   another person, you've got a very good test as to whether you're preaching the gospel
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.980]   in the right way.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.740]   What's that?
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:46.660]   Well, let me put it like this to you.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:56.420]   If your presentation of the gospel does not expose it to the charge of antinomianism,
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.380]   you are probably not putting it correctly.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.380]   What do I mean by that, just this?
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:14.300]   The gospel, you see, comes as this free gift of God, irrespective of what man does.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:19.540]   Now the moment you say a thing like that, you are liable to provoke somebody to say,
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.580]   "Well, if that is so, it doesn't matter what I do."
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.940]   The apostle takes up that argument more than once in this great epistle.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:36.300]   "What then," he says at the beginning of chapter 6, "shall we do evil, commit sin that grace
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.140]   may abound?"
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:43.980]   He's just been saying the more sin abounded, where sin abounded, grace does much more abound.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.580]   "Very well," said someone, "this is a marvelous doctrine, this, go and get drunk, do what
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:54.860]   you like, the grace of God will put you right," antinomianism.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:45:02.060]   Now this doctrine of the scriptures, this justification by faith only, this free grace
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:10.140]   of God in salvation, is always exposed to that charge of antinomianism.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.540]   Paul was charged with it.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.180]   He said, "You know, some people say that that's what I'm preaching."
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.380]   Paul's preaching was charged with antinomianism.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.820]   The Jews especially said, "Now," they said, "this man, he tells us that the law can't
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.180]   save us very well.
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.940]   What he's really saying to people is this, 'Sin as much as you like.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.620]   The more you sin, the more the grace of God will fall down upon you.'"
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.900]   That's what he's teaching.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.020]   It's lawlessness.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:42.860]   He's encouraging an antinomianism, an antagonism to the law.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:47.160]   So I say that it's a very good test of preaching.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.020]   You see, what is not evangelical preaching is this, is the kind of preaching which says
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:46:03.980]   to people, "Now, if you live a good life, if you don't commit certain sins, and if
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:09.240]   you do good to others, and if you become a church member and attend regularly and are
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.460]   busy and active, you'll be a fine Christian and you'll go to heaven."
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.640]   That's the opposite of evangelical preaching.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.020]   And it isn't exposed, you see, to the charge of antinomianism, because it is encouraging
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.020]   good works.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.980]   It's telling men to save themselves by their good works.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:37.940]   And it's not the gospel, because the gospel always exposes itself to this misunderstanding
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:43.660]   from the standpoint of antinomianism.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:50.700]   So let all of us test our preaching, our conversation, our talk to others about the gospel by that
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.780]   particular test.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.180]   Does it make a certain clever type of man say, "Ha, well, I see that.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:04.460]   I see now the whole position is it doesn't matter what I do, all is well."
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:08.600]   And if you don't make people say things like that sometimes, if you're not misunderstood
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:13.980]   and slanderously reported from the standpoint of antinomianism, it's because you don't
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.420]   believe the gospel truly and you don't preach it truly.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:25.300]   What a wonderful gospel this is, and how we ought to thank God even for a difficult passage
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.700]   like this which we've been considering together tonight.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:34.620]   I've drawn great comfort and consolation from it as I've been trying to show you.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.940]   We've got the apostolic method of dealing with difficulties.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:45.020]   And we see here this essential message.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:50.820]   And we see that it is of such a character that evil men will always, in their cleverness
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:58.380]   as they think, be able to entirely shortcut it and sidetrack it, and turn it even into
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:02.980]   saying the exact opposite of what it says.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:09.940]   Because we preach that a man is saved in spite of his works, it doesn't mean for a second
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:15.260]   that therefore we say, "Let us do evil that good may come," not at all.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:19.300]   Do we make void the law Paul is going to say at the end of this chapter?
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.860]   He says, "No, we establish the law."
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   Very well.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:30.300]   God willing, as I say, having now dealt with these questions and queries and difficulties,
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:36.500]   we shall be able to follow him as he marshals his great catena of evidence, culled from
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:41.980]   the Old Testament, to prove his point beyond any peradventure.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.780]   Let us pray.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:55.580]   O Lord, our God, we would thank Thee more than ever that it is Thy way, not ours.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:00.820]   And we see that Thy ways are not our ways, nor Thy thoughts our thoughts.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:06.060]   We thank Thee that as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are Thy thoughts and our
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.580]   thoughts.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.340]   We thank Thee for this glorious salvation.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:17.380]   Lord God, we would almost thank Thee for the difficulties.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:22.260]   We would thank Thee for the fact that it is what it is and as it is.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:28.500]   And oh, we thank Thee for the instruction and the warnings and the safeguards, for the
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:34.380]   way Thou didst cause Thy servant of old and others to work out these arguments for us
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:39.540]   so that before we are born they are here ready and waiting for us.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:47.660]   O God, make us wise, we pray Thee, in these things, that we may be kept from error ourselves
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:54.900]   and that we may be able to help others who are tempted to error by the wiles of Satan
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.660]   and the subtlety of men as the result of sin.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.740]   O God, dismiss us with Thy blessing.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:08.340]   Make us all instruments in Thy hands to be of help to others who are battling with difficulties
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.940]   and problems.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:16.860]   Take us upon our way and use us in our homes and in all our circumstances in life to the
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:21.700]   glory and the praise of Thy great and holy name.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:28.060]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:36.620]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.180]   Amen.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.100]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
