[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   - I'm interested in this concept of burnout.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.080]   We hear about burnout.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.000]   We associate it with too much adrenaline,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.180]   lack of sleep, tired and wired, feeling disengaged.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.740]   The poet David White has a beautiful poem,
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.120]   I forget the title, about burnout where he says
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   that I think the cure to burnout is wholeheartedness.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.000]   And I always like that, it's a bit more abstract
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.940]   than the kinds of things we're talking about today.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.780]   But I like that,
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.720]   because there's something about wholeheartedness,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.200]   really leaning into something with the true desire
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.880]   to be there and to explore it no matter how hard,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.760]   that is the opposite extreme of burnout.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.840]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I think burnout in,
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.700]   if we're thinking knowledge work,
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.360]   like people with office jobs, my diagnosis there,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.320]   it's not exactly quantity of work that does play a role,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.480]   it's the kind of work.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.600]   Because I think what's happening, what's been deranging,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.320]   actually, for people in these jobs is
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.960]   workloads are getting larger, right?
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.320]   In part because communication is low friction
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.400]   and we always wanna be demonstrating activity
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.760]   because of pseudo productivity
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.680]   and people are always asking us to do things, we say yes.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.600]   Everything we say yes to
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.220]   brings with it administrative overhead, right?
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.520]   Which is talking about the thing but not actually doing it.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.220]   So it's like emails about the commitment,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.440]   it's meetings about the commitment.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.680]   Because our workloads are larger,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.800]   what happens then is more and more of our time
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.600]   has to service this administrative overhead
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.040]   because everything we say yes to
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.480]   brings with it its own overhead,
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.120]   it adds up, it aggregates, right?
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.520]   So now more and more of our day
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.120]   is spent talking about work
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.240]   and not actually doing the work
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   and to make it even worse,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.000]   it's not like this overhead is all batched together,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.560]   it's sort of spread out throughout your day.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.200]   So it's also putting you in that state
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.860]   of constant distraction, which makes it hard to do work.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440]   What I think is burning people out
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.280]   is they're now in this state where they're saying,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.480]   I'm spending most of my day talking about work,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.460]   sending emails, attending meetings.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460]   Very little time is left to actually
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.160]   make progress on the work.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.360]   And then the workload gets larger and larger.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.440]   This by itself is deranging, right?
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.280]   It feels like you're in some sort of nihilistic experiment.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.120]   Like, what is this?
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.560]   Why do I have six hours in meetings?
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'm not actually, this can't be the right way to work.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.440]   And then what happens, of course,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.600]   is you have to recover time in the morning and the afternoon,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.160]   maybe after your kids go to bed,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.520]   to try to actually make progress.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.360]   So now you also have just a straight work quantity issue.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.880]   So you're working more hours.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.240]   There's an energy drain.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.760]   But I think that psychological piece
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.640]   of this can't possibly make sense,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.440]   that like I'm checking email once every two minutes
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.000]   and spent six hours in Zoom,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   like doing very little actual high value work.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   Like this can't be the right way to work.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.800]   That's what I think the burnout epidemic
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   right now is coming from,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.840]   is that psychological component of,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.640]   we all know this is stupid,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   but no one is saying the emperor has no clothes on.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.400]   We all know that the amount of email and meetings I'm doing
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.160]   is such a waste of my salary.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.440]   Like this is a highly trained brain.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.400]   Like I could be writing these reports or this code
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.160]   or creating these business strategies,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.520]   but we're all just accepting this.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.480]   I think the absurdity of the current situation
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.200]   is creating as much of the burnout as it is just,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.880]   we also have to add these extra hours.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.240]   There's just like a straight aggregation of work quantity.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   - It's almost analogous to taking professional athletes
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.200]   or would be professional athletes
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.520]   and having them do a bunch of other physical labor
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.520]   so that they're showing up not fresh for the game
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.080]   and little micro injuries and distracted.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.920]   - And no one's admitting that this doesn't make sense
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.160]   and everyone's just getting injured
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.460]   and no one's talking about it.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.520]   So it's the absurdity of it would drive people crazy.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.080]   And it is driving people crazy.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.840]   - It's so difficult though,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.240]   because certain things like smartphones
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.280]   are very useful on the hospital ward.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.600]   I mean, doctors can communicate,
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.840]   nurses communicate so much faster now.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.440]   Parents and kids can communicate.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.400]   Who's gonna pick up the kids?
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.280]   Nope, got stuck in traffic, you go this way.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.800]   Alternate route on Google maps and on and on.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.920]   So it's all woven in with stuff
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.280]   that's also highly adaptive.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.920]   It makes it tough.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.680]   It's almost like the work of being a selective filter
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.800]   is half the work of trying to deload the cognitive systems
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.320]   that would allow you to do deep work.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.400]   - Yeah, well, in the workplace it's even harder than that.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.160]   Because part of the issue is email and Slack,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.280]   let's just say digital communication.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.360]   I spent a lot of time studying that closely, right?
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.280]   From like a technocritic standpoint,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.680]   the introduction of digital communication to the workplace.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.000]   And the problem there
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.040]   is the reason why we're checking this all the time.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.240]   It's not some like individual habit deoptimization.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.400]   It's not, oh, I should just check this less often.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.720]   What happened is when we introduced
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.560]   low friction digital communication to the office,
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.480]   this emerging consensus came about that said,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.940]   great, let's just use ad hoc messaging
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.200]   as our major way of collaborating.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.920]   Like we can just figure things out on the fly.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.760]   I can just be like, Andrew, what's going on with the whatever
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.080]   and you can answer me and I can send it back.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.120]   This was very convenient.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.760]   The activation cost was low.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.400]   And so this is how we began actually collaborating on work.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.460]   Now what happens is as workloads get higher,
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.480]   we now have many things at the same time.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.140]   They're all generating these asynchronous
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.880]   back and forth conversations.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.520]   Most of these have some sort of time sensitivity, right?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.900]   So if I email you and say like,
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.100]   what's going on with like the guests coming later today?
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.640]   We have to kind of resolve this before later today.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.320]   So now it's not just that these messages
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.360]   are going back and forth with all these different threads,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   but I have to keep checking my inbox
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.600]   to make sure the gap's not too big.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   This is not a failure of habits.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.320]   It's not a moral failure.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.200]   It's necessitated by the fact
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.860]   that all these back and forth conversations
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.640]   have to keep moving forward.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.320]   So it is difficult then if you're in this system
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.120]   to step out by yourself
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   because this is the way we're collaborating
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.920]   is these asynchronous back and forth messages.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.240]   And I can't disengage myself from that
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.200]   without slowing things down.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.080]   Like from a mathematical game theory point of view,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.320]   it's a suboptimal Nash equilibrium.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   It's not the right place,
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.000]   not the right way to run this.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360]   The utility value of this configuration is low,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.720]   but no one individual can deploy a different strategy
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.000]   that's gonna be higher value.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.440]   We're stuck in it, right?
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.520]   And so now it becomes really hard for an individual
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.620]   just to say, I want to check my email less often.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.480]   It's built in systemically
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.360]   into this hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.880]   And the only way to break free
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.840]   from the suboptimal configuration
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   is to basically have the organization itself
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.840]   do like a really high cost change to the rules of the game.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.500]   These are how we're collaborating now.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.760]   We're not using email freely anymore.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.240]   We're gonna use this system instead.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.040]   It's a very expensive top-down procedure
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.240]   to free ourselves from the suboptimality.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.300]   It's like in the world of work,
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.440]   that's partially why this is such an intractable problem.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.280]   I mean, I tried to write a book about this recently
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.820]   and it was really hard to gain traction
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.400]   because it's not easy to solve this.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.200]   Like no individual can move out of this
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.280]   and you have to put in a lot of energy
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.040]   as an organization to try to change this.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.000]   So it's in some sense,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.720]   email is a more insidious problem
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.400]   than social media on the phone.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.980]   'Cause at least over here,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.560]   this is my engagement with this.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.520]   And I might have these moderate behavioral addictions,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.360]   but I could make differences here.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.760]   In my company, oh, this is much worse.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.600]   This is like a systemic problem.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.880]   It's an emergent deterministic work impact
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.280]   on a economic, social, cultural system
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.080]   that was completely dynamical
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.780]   and went in a way we didn't really expect.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.800]   So it's a really tough situation sometimes,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.560]   especially in the world of work.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.880]   How do we get out of this constant distraction?
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   It's why, you know, I wrote "Deep Work"
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.480]   and I was like, well, why don't people just do this?
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.860]   That's why they don't just do this,
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.360]   because it's not so easy to reclaim this time.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.840]   - Well, it's like when I was a graduate student in postdoc,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.900]   I was focused on eating pretty well,
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.240]   meaning just clean-ish food.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   And people talked less about that at that time.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.080]   I was also really committed to exercise since I was 16.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.900]   People were less committed to that
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.460]   in the academic sector at that time.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.140]   Now, I think it's commonplace for people.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.180]   Like, I'm going to my yoga class.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.260]   I'm doing my zone two cardio.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.100]   I go to the gym.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.940]   You know, men and women do this.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.460]   You know, I remember having like this,
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.860]   like sneak off to the gym, like, okay, yeah.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.380]   And, you know, you felt like a bit of an oddball
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.060]   if you were the one bringing your lunch
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.420]   to the, you know, the pizza luncheon.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.020]   Not that there's anything wrong with pizza, I love pizza,
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.340]   but I was trying to eat well.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.220]   I have for a long time.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.660]   I feel better when I do, and I'm grateful that I did.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.020]   But you get some weird looks like,
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.980]   oh, do you have an eating disorder or something like that?
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.020]   That's what people would say then.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.100]   Now, people would probably look and go,
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.380]   that looks better than the pizza.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.280]   People start to understand.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.340]   So I think there needs to be a cultural shift.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.260]   And I think there has been a cultural shift
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.620]   around food and exercise.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.500]   Certainly food, meditation, sleep.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.260]   I think people are far more accepting
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.580]   and actually encouraging of their workers and coworkers
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.540]   taking really good care
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.420]   in order to function better for longer.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.100]   - Yeah, I think this is gonna be the next revolution.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.220]   And it's gonna be a revolution that's gonna unlock,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.900]   we're talking on the scale of like a trillion dollar GDP.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.260]   When we go through knowledge work and have this revolution,
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.340]   I call it like the cognitive revolution.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.460]   Let's take really seriously
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.540]   how the brains of our workers work.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.020]   Like these are our number one assets,
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.800]   like not to be too mechanistic about it,
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.780]   but what is our main capital asset
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.160]   if we're a knowledge work organization?
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.140]   We have some buildings, but it's really these brains
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.520]   that we have like employment contracts with.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.380]   These brains create value.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.780]   Let's take seriously how the brains actually operate.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.500]   And as soon as we do, we'll say,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.060]   oh my God, these brains are checking email
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.900]   once every two minutes.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.060]   What a disaster.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.660]   It's like if we had a car factory
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.780]   and we spent $20 million on one of these German robots
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.420]   that can put cars on the doors or whatever,
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.940]   and we just weren't taking care of it.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.020]   And it was like rusty and it was dropping the doors
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.540]   and the production pipeline was going down.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.560]   It was like, this is crazy.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.140]   We gotta take care of this equipment, right?
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.780]   When we have the cognitive revolution,
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.300]   the sort of cognitive capital revolution
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.980]   in knowledge work, I think it's gonna unlock
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.140]   a trillion dollar GDP.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.420]   I think that's how unproductive we've been.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.860]   If we just think in the pure raw terms
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.020]   of brains producing stuff that's worth money,
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.780]   like if we're just like super deterministic
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.980]   and kind of inhumane about it,
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.340]   so much is being lost because we're in the suboptimal
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.180]   Nash equilibrium.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.460]   Everyone just email everyone all the time.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.860]   Everyone's just on Slack all the time.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.180]   That when we finally have the revolution to get over that,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.100]   it's gonna be a massive economic hit.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.780]   And AI might play a role in this, right?
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.300]   Because maybe AI, once it gets planning capabilities,
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.580]   is gonna be able to take the burden
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.300]   of some of this back and forth planning.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.140]   I think it's easier to get there with cultural shifts.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.820]   I don't think we have to wait to build
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.940]   an email capable chat GPT to do this.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.260]   Like you could solve this tomorrow.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.560]   This is cultural as much as it's tool-based.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.500]   But I think it's gonna be a huge revolution
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.920]   when we get there, akin to like the assembly line
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.020]   in manufacturing, which was like a 10X improvement
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.500]   in productivity metrics.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.540]   When we figured out the continuous motion assembly line
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.120]   with interchangeable parts was a massive,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.500]   it created this productivity engine.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.860]   I'm using the economic sense of productivity now,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.540]   you know, dollars per worker.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.060]   The economic miracle that came from this process-based
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.620]   industrial innovations in the late 19th,
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.660]   early 20th century, the money generated by that,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.420]   the wealth generated by that was the foundation
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.720]   of the modern West.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.980]   Like the whole world as we know it was built.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.340]   So there's these huge latent potentials.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.180]   And right now I don't think we're there with the brain.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.100]   And I think it's gonna be a huge revolution.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.960]   It's just difficult, right?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.540]   It's not an easy revolution to start,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.580]   but I think it's gonna change whole industries
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.980]   in ways that it's gonna be hard to even imagine.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.860]   - Thank you for tuning in
