[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and welcome to the Financial Samurai podcast
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.880]   I just wanted to share some background about me and why you should listen to the Financial Samurai podcast on your way to financial freedom
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.000]   So I started financialsamurai.com in the middle of the crisis in July 2009
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.140]   It was literally about the bottom of the previous financial crisis
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.180]   I had lost about 35% of my net worth within six months and I was pretty devastated
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.340]   I had thought about starting financial samurai in 2006, but I was just too busy
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.340]   I just graduated from business school at UC Berkeley and I was like well
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.920]   It's time to get going and utilize my MBA to make more money in my day job
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.500]   My day job was in the Asian equities department at a major investment bank
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.600]   Two years in New York City and 11 years in San Francisco, and it was a really really great time
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.000]   But the financial crisis really kind of knocked me knocked me on my back and it was just a really really tough time
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.960]   so I thought writing was better than smoking or drinking as a cathartic way to make sense of all the chaos and
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.440]   Over time the site has grown to be my biggest passion
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.520]   It's something that I just truly love to do every single day and I've been writing three times a week since 2009
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.880]   so over ten years now and in 2017, I
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.320]   Decided to regularly focus on doing this podcast
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.280]   Because I thought it was a new way to keep in touch and to get in touch and to reach more people
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.460]   Who also want to reach financial independence sooner rather than later?
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.560]   All right. So let's start a little bit from the beginning here
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   I grew up in the Philippines Zambia Japan Taiwan and Malaysia for 13 years
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.600]   Before coming to the United States for high school and college
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.180]   My parents were both in the US Foreign Service and were stationed all around the world when I was growing up
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.140]   Due to my upbringing I caught the travel bug very early on and it has never never left
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.360]   I visited over 60 countries as of 2019
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.860]   But I've slowed down my travels since having a boy in 2017
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.780]   I'm very pro public school because I went to a public high school and I went to the College of William and Mary
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.500]   For in-state tuition and it's also a public school. So I'm totally biased
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.060]   I just don't think people should spend a fortune going to private school to get an education that I don't
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.660]   Know I don't think is worth as much as was 10 20 30 years ago
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.220]   Because we can all learn everything on the internet for free
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.220]   One of my goals after college was to work overseas in Asia
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.700]   Since that's where I grew up for 13 years and I came very very close when my dad's friend offered me a job to work
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.900]   At his eyeglass parts factory in Shenzhen China in 1999. It was very tempting
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.740]   China was absolutely booming in 1999 and it just opened up its economy to foreign investments and I thought well
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.500]   Gosh going to China would be great because I could improve on my Mandarin skills and I can maybe make a fortune as an entrepreneur
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.660]   there
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.620]   But I kind of chickened out because I got a job at an investment bank called Goldman Sachs in New York City
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.980]   Which is something unheard of for someone coming out of the College of William & Mary because it was a non-target
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.540]   Public school and so after I think it was around 55 interviews and seven rounds over a six plus month time period
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.140]   I finally got the job and I'll see to myself after going through all that to just reject them
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.060]   I think that would be really really foolish and
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.700]   It just goes to show you that you never know what might happen if you get on a bus at 6 a.m
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.460]   On a Saturday morning to go to a career fair. It was one of my best moves I ever made I got on this bus
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.620]   Nobody else got on the bus even though 30 of my fellow students signed up
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.460]   So the bus driver after waiting for 45 minutes decided to take me in the bus
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.140]   to some home base and swap the bus out for a Lincoln Town car and
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.660]   Go up to that two and a half hour drive to Washington DC. So I that was the first time I felt like a boss
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.780]   After working in New York City for two years
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.980]   I got a great offer to come to San Francisco for another competing investment bank
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.780]   And it was interesting because it was a total leap of faith because I knew nobody in San Francisco
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.940]   But I said, you know what?
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.220]   I'm probably gonna get fired at Goldman Sachs because of dot-com bubble bursting in 2000 and this was 2001
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.940]   So I was like, you know what? I'm gonna take this job and I'm gonna go for it
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.820]   So I came out here and 11 years later
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.340]   I had a really great career because I thought I thought there's no way I could last more than five years in investment banking
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.660]   Because I was getting in by 530 a.m. And leaving at 8 p.m. On a regular regular basis
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.620]   So in 2009, like I said, I did start financial samurai and it was my passion project
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.500]   I started working on it before work
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.620]   sometimes during my lunch break and after work, it's all I could ever think about and in
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.100]   2011 two years after I started it it started gaining a lot of steam and I was in Santorini Greece with my wife on a
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.380]   Cruise and she had gone off to hike around and check out some various shops and I was tired
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.780]   so I plopped myself up in a bar overlooking the crater checking my phone because there was Wi-Fi at the time and
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.820]   In my inbox was an advertiser a client who was based in London who said hey, I'd like to advertise on your site
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.500]   Are you interested if you put up this link? I'll give you $1,200 and I'll see myself really
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.140]   1,200 bucks just to put up a link and I was hesitant because I don't know that's a lot of money and I'm on my
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.780]   Phone I'd never done this before but he said hey just put up this link copy this code into your page and
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.060]   Once it's up, let me know and I'll PayPal you the 1,200 bucks
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.500]   So I got to work it took about 20 minutes to figure things out and I was drinking my overpriced
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.340]   Mythos beer that was like nine bucks at the time and then I quickly put up the code and the advertisement and then boom
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.420]   Within 15 minutes. He sent me $1,200 and that was the moment. That was my up. Aha epiphany
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:21.180]   Whatever moment or I thought maybe there is life after investment in banking and that's when my my gears started turning in my head
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.940]   How do I leave this industry that I no longer enjoyed right? I was oh
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.580]   I was already doing it for 12 years up until 2011 and I thought aha
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:38.380]   Maybe I can follow some of my peers who got let go with an amazing severance package during the financial crisis
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.540]   and
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.580]   So I started thinking about it and I started talking to people who got let go and I realized wow these people
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.380]   Were pretty hooked up once they got let go
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.020]   So in February after I got my terrible bonus for 2011, I raised my hand and I said hey boss
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.740]   I'm interested in doing something else
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.100]   but in exchange
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.380]   For training my subordinate to take over my accounts and have a really really smooth transition
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.700]   I would like to get all my deferred compensation in terms of stock and cash and
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.060]   I would like to get a severance equal to what normal people would get laid off would get
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:24.260]   Who had worked at the firm for 11 years and it took about two months two months of negotiating and hemming and hawing and wondering?
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.380]   What's up?
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.380]   But they said Sam
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.700]   We agree. We're sorry to see you go, but we can give you this severance package. I think you're right
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.180]   If your heart's not in it, we'd love to take care of you and have you do something else
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.900]   So I accepted I took that leap of faith and I said, thank you so much
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.180]   I'll accept that severance package and be on my way
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.500]   It was no doubt scary to leave that multiple six-figure job security behind
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.780]   I mean I was getting profit sharing in my 401k of 20,000 plus a year
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.020]   So to leave all that
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   Man, it didn't feel
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.500]   Great, but I was definitely excited and I told myself at the age of 34
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.980]   It was now or never if I failed at trying something new
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.340]   Then I can just go back to work
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.300]   It took I think two years for my series 7 license to expire
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.460]   So I knew I had two years and if I failed after two years
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:24.540]   At least I wouldn't regret having tried and that's kind of the key message that I have over and over again
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.540]   To put yourself out there and to try because the worst thing that can happen is that nothing happens
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:35.060]   Maybe someone might laugh at you, but who cares people who laugh at you are the people who aren't willing to try themselves
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.380]   They don't have the courage. So ever since
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:45.340]   2012 when I left my full-time job, I've been dedicating about 20 to 25 hours a week writing on financial samurai
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:52.420]   Financial samurai is my baby and financial samurai is for anybody who wants to achieve financial freedom sooner rather than later
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:09:00.460]   So what differentiates financial samurai from so many other financial sites? Well one I started in 2009
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:08.380]   - it's written and spoken by a person who was in the financial services industry and who got an MBA
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.400]   So I am living and breathing everything finance
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.720]   Three I write about my personal experiences all the time and what I've learned and the mistakes that I've made
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.740]   So you don't have to make the same mistakes
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:28.260]   So if you want to build wealth by making more money in your day job or through your business or from your investments
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.300]   I think financial samurai is the place you want to be. I'm always gonna be sharing stories and lessons
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   I've learned where I've made mistakes
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.220]   So you don't have to or the things where I feel, you know make a lot of sense in terms of investing
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.100]   you're never gonna get everything right, but at least if we share our thoughts and listen to how other people have
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.100]   Progressed in their lives. I think we can improve our lives ourselves
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.900]   If you're curious about my net worth you can check out the post the first million might be the easiest
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.980]   How to become a millionaire by 30
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.940]   Basically, my path was very lucky. I was able to get a good job out of college
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.980]   I knew that I didn't want to be an investment bank for decades like my parents were in their respective industries
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.980]   And so I saved aggressively
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.300]   50 to 70 percent after tax for 13 consecutive years at the age of 28
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.200]   I was able to breach the 1 million net worth mark and I didn't really even know it and by
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.940]   2012 when I left my day job for good and my net worth was about 3 million dollars and I don't share and my net worth
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.940]   After that because it becomes kind of like a distraction
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.660]   But suffice it to say it has grown because there's been this huge bull market
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:43.420]   I've been riding and I hopefully you guys have been riding and it's a very very lucky time to be alive
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.140]   and it's a very lucky time to do something new on the internet and
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.820]   Also do something more unconventional rather than just your day job
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:58.360]   I do have several tenants that I follow one is if the amount of money you're saving each month doesn't hurt
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.760]   You're not saving enough. It's the same idea with braces, for example
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.340]   You know, if you've ever had braces when you're feeling pain in your gum and teeth, that means, you know, it's working
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:17.700]   It's kind of like working out if you don't feel sore the very next day and you just want to sleep in or take a hot
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.180]   Tub bath. Well, you know you didn't work hard enough
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.540]   It's the same thing with your finances
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:31.340]   The more you feel that visceral pain of saving and investing the more you have to second-guess like oh
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.820]   Maybe I have to cut my spending down a little bit
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:40.900]   That is when you know, you're finally saving enough and the other very important principle that I follow is this
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.980]   Never fail due to a lack of effort because effort requires no skill
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.260]   This is a saying that I've held on since high school
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:57.380]   Because I recognized I was a really average person in terms of intelligence in terms of athletic ability in terms of looks and so forth
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.580]   The only way I could get ahead
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:05.500]   Was to try harder than most people because trying harder doesn't require any skill at all
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.940]   There are no excuses for not trying harder and if you fail if I fail, okay, whatever
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.060]   At least I tried and I won't regret having not tried my best
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:21.340]   So I hope you guys really enjoy your time on financial samurai. You can read the posts subscribe
