[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   an overview of these case studies and an overview of the exam questions numbered
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.800]   12 to 20 and what you'll find is that in the case studies what we're really going
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.400]   to be asking you to do is to take the material that we have already covered in
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.240]   the theology exams numbers 1 to 24 and then also the counseling exams numbers
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.700]   1 to 11 and then we're going to ask you to apply them as it relates to a
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.080]   specific case study so what you'll find in counseling exams number 12 to 20 is
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.040]   that we're not really covering new ground we're not covering any new
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.440]   information but we're taking the material that we have already covered in
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.000]   the year 2 training and asking you to apply them to a specific counseling
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.120]   situation for example one of the exam questions asks you to relate what exact
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.960]   homework you would assign to a person going through a specific counseling
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   issue well if you've been with us in our year 1 and year 2 training you know the
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.120]   value of homework you understand the broad categories of what you might
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.920]   assign as homework and what you're gonna be doing in this exam question is taking
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.640]   those concepts and then specifically designing a homework scenario a homework
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.600]   assignment that would help a counselee through a specific counseling issue and
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.280]   so again we're not covering any real new information in exams 12 to 20 but we're
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.760]   taking the information we have already covered and applying them to specific
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.680]   counseling scenarios we are also going to be asking you to work through your
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.000]   own personal counseling approach to these case studies and so with the
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.920]   different students in our class we would expect to find the same basic
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.080]   foundational understanding of what homework is what good an inventory
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.200]   asking questions would would be about but we will find that each of the
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.640]   students should be assigning their own specific homework in other words each of
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.100]   you will be unique in how you will apply these principles to a specific
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.300]   counseling issue because each of you are uniquely gifted and have your own unique
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.720]   strengths in counseling ministry and so what I thought would be helpful for us
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   tonight is just to do an overview of the case study make you familiar with the
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   case studies being presented and then also familiar with what categories are
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.360]   they asking you to go back and review and then apply to a specific counseling
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.560]   scenario you'll find me saying oftentimes in the next hour what we're
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.820]   gonna do is ask you to review this lesson and then apply it to the case
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.760]   study that you're looking at in this question and so I hope that makes sense
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.600]   of what we're about in the next hour what we're aiming to do we're gonna be
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   giving you an orientation as to the three case studies that are presented in
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.800]   these essay questions and then asking you to do your own work as to taking the
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.960]   material we've already covered and then applying it to a counseling scenario so
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.600]   I hope this will be a helpful study for all of us so thank you for joining us
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.460]   tonight let me open us in a word of prayer and we will get started in the
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.680]   case study let's pray father we do thank you so much for your word and for the
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.080]   precious truth that has been given to us in the holy scriptures and we thank you
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.560]   for the privilege of studying your word for the privilege of understanding your
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.040]   word and for the privilege of ministering your word in counseling
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.360]   ministry we thank you for the many biblical counselors that you are raising
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.960]   up around the nation who are devoted to the sufficiency of the scripture and
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.040]   pray that father our time tonight would be profitable that we would engage in a
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.880]   useful hour of orientation and that you would help each of the students in this
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.840]   class to think deeply and to apply these principles to the case studies before us
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   and father this would be a helpful exercise for each of us in our
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.120]   counseling training thank you for this time and thank you for the great time
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.560]   we've had this year in studying your work together and we commit this time to
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   you in Jesus name amen amen well if you look at the first page of your handout
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.320]   we come to the first case study that is presented to us which is the case study
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.920]   concerning Eric now I encourage the students in year two training that if
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:20.440]   you're a female counselor please feel free to give Eric a female a female name
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:28.920]   Erica may be a good name that you might assign to this counselee and if you're a
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.000]   female counselor you most likely will be counseling a female in counseling
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.180]   ministry so feel free to give Eric make Eric a female counselee and give a
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.660]   female name but the case study is this Eric is a 20 year old believer who has
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.080]   been struggling with pornography for the last three years before that time he
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   knew that pornography existed but had never seen it because his parents
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   carefully monitored all the technology in their home Eric discovered porn on a
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.480]   trip out of town when some of his friends from high school showed it to
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.280]   him on their phones since then Eric has frequently looked at pornography the
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.720]   problem became worse when he moved to college and had unfettered access to the
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.560]   internet on his laptop computer several weeks ago Eric became convinced that as
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.920]   a Christian he must begin to deal aggressively with this sin he did the
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.240]   hardest thing he had ever done and told his dad about the problem Eric's dad
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.200]   loves his son and wants to help him but has no idea what to do about a problem
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:46.920]   like this they came together to meet you for counsel so the counseling case study
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.520]   here has to do with the issue of pornography and the question associated
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   with the case study is counseling exam number 12 assume that the information
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.360]   you have here is a straightforward presentation of the facts and write down
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.060]   the homework assignments you want Eric or Erica to complete after this first
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.320]   meeting with you after you list the homework explain the specific issues you
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.040]   will address with Eric in counseling sessions please include the categories
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:31.640]   of put off and put on in your answer so the question here has to do with
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.720]   homework assignments what type of homework assignments would you want to
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.040]   assign to Eric as you help Eric with this counseling issue you will remember
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.960]   that the category of homework assignments is covered in the six eyes a
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.560]   biblical counseling under the methods section of our year one training we
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.680]   cover the six eyes or the six key elements of biblical counseling and the
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:14.560]   last the sixth eye was the key element of implementation that is the assigning
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.440]   of homework between the counseling sessions that will help a counselee work
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.560]   through a certain counseling issue now that is the broad category of
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:33.540]   information that you want to bring to bear upon counseling exam number 12 if
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:39.760]   you remember from our overview of the key element of implementation we looked
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.400]   at the categories of Bible reading Bible memorization church involvement the
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.280]   assigning of involvement in small groups or attendance at Sunday morning worship
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.640]   services the listening to of sermons or of specific lectures books and booklets
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:09.200]   even engagement in relationships asking three to four people to pray for you or
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.640]   involving yourself with an accountability partner we even talked
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:21.440]   about the fact that you can assign songs to listen to or hymns to sing you can
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.320]   really get very specific in homework assignment as you work with a counselee
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.480]   and those are just broad categories books and booklets Bible reading Bible
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.760]   memorization church involvement those are broad categories to think through as
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:45.120]   you think as you think about homework assignment in relation to a specific
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:51.800]   counseling issue now what you want to do in this counseling exam is work through
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.440]   those categories of Bible reading Bible memorization books booklets sermons
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:06.040]   lectures songs to sing relationships and give some specific assignments in those
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:13.440]   categories to Eric as you help him through this counseling issue or if you
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:21.400]   help Erica through her counseling issue think through some specific passages of
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:29.080]   Scripture that you want the counselee to read and to memorize think through some
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.000]   good books that would be helpful as it relates to this counseling issue think
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.600]   through relationships in the local church perhaps you want your counselee
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.280]   to ask three to four people in the church who are trusted to get involved
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.320]   with the counselee in working through this counseling issue or perhaps one
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:58.160]   specific accountability partner that the counselee can be engaged in think
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.400]   through with the specific issue of pornography the installation of an
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   internet filter on in a smartphone or on a computer in homework you can really
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.920]   assign anything that would help your counselee work through the counseling
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.520]   issue and the more specific you can get in this essay as to the specific
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.840]   homework assignments you would give to Eric or Erica the better your essay will
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:36.880]   be now think through order of sequence one possible way one possible approach
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.080]   to write this essay is paragraph number one you might want to talk about what
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.440]   type of homework you would assign on the first session as you work through a
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.520]   counseling issue in this way you will note that the homework assignment given
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.040]   at the first session will be different from the homework assignments dealt with
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.520]   in sessions two three and four in your first session assignments you may want
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.880]   to focus on Bible reading and Bible passages that give hope to the believer
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   that give hope for change and you might want to think through the categories of
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.480]   indicatives and imperatives and promises and assign a balance of biblical reading
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.040]   that would both give hope for the counselee to change and then also give
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.800]   some specific direction as to how the counselee is to change some good reading
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.680]   assignments to give in specific specifically relating to the issue of
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.120]   pornography is Heath Lambert's finally free fighting for purity by the power of
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.740]   grace is an excellent resource that we use in counseling ministry a very
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:04.280]   grace-centered Bible centered gospel centered approach to dealing with the
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:10.160]   issue of pornography a very excellent work that I would recommend to you there
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.920]   is specific counseling homework assignment in a Christian growth and
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   discipleship manual written by Wayne Mac and Wayne Johnston just some good
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:28.720]   homework handouts to give to a counselee that would relate to this issue and so
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920]   those are some good homework assignments that you might want to give to Eric or
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.120]   Erica one key passage that I would recommend that you use in counseling
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:46.680]   ministry as it relates to the issue of pornography or even temptation to sexual
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:55.180]   immorality is Romans chapter 6 verses 1 to 14 just a wonderful passage of
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.840]   scripture that gives hope to the counselee that the counselee can change
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.200]   by the grace of God based upon the person and work of Jesus Christ Paul says
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.760]   there in verse 1 what shall we say then are we to continue in sin that grace
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:17.860]   might may abound by no means how can we who died to sin still live in it or do
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.880]   you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   baptized into his death we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.000]   in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.500]   Father we too might walk in newness of life and then I love what Paul says in
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.240]   verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to make you obey its
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.160]   passions do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.440]   but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.680]   and your members to God as instruments for righteousness for sin will have no
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.560]   dominion over you since you are not under law but under grace and so Heath
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.960]   Lambert in his book finally freed as a great job of unpacking the significance
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:24.600]   of Romans chapter 6 in relation to the pursuit of purity we begin from the
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.200]   standpoint of this great indicative that the Christian is no longer a slave to
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:36.360]   sin the Christian may be tempted to sin but a Christian is not enslaved to sin
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.560]   or under the dominion of sin the Christian does not need to sin the
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.020]   Christian can by the grace of God and because of the person and work of Jesus
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:52.320]   Christ pursue holiness and overcome temptation and so that might be a
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.520]   passage that you might assign to a counselee who is wrestling with
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:04.360]   temptation to pornography or to sexual immorality another key passage is 1st
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.760]   Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 3 where Paul says for this is the will of God
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.800]   your sanctification that you abstain from sexual immorality that each one of
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.960]   you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor not in the passion of
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.880]   lust like the Gentiles who do not know God that no one transgress and wrong his
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.640]   brother in this matter because the Lord is an avenger in all these things as we
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   told you beforehand and solemnly warned you for God has not called us for
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.920]   impurity but in holiness so these are some possible texts that you might
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.200]   assign to a counselee to read even to memorize you want to be careful not to
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.840]   overwhelm the counselee with homework that would be overly burdensome but
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:02.480]   think through passages in your own study and remember to think through the the
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   categories of indicatives imperatives and promises indicatives what God has
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:16.560]   done for us in Christ imperatives how we are to live in light of Christ perfect
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.280]   work on our behalf and then promises what God has promised to do in our lives
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:28.600]   for each believer in Christ just be balanced in your assigning of homework
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.040]   don't give all promises don't give all indicatives don't give all imperatives
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.360]   but think through those categories in terms of a balanced approach that would
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.320]   help the counselee deal with these issues and then thinking through the
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:52.000]   language of put off and put on that's coming from Ephesians chapter 4 verses
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.880]   22 to 28 which talks about the fact that we are to put off the old man and put on
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:09.160]   the new man and so sanctification is put off and put on in other words our
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:19.920]   goal is not for Eric or Erica merely to put off immorality but we also want Eric
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:26.840]   or Erica to put on the pursuit of God and the pursuit of Christ likeness
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:33.100]   sanctification is not just abstaining from involvement with pornography but
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:42.600]   sanctification is putting on a passion for holiness and a passion for true
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.840]   sanctification and likeness to Christ it is putting off the selfishness that
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:56.640]   would lead to involvement with pornography and putting on service and
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:05.840]   giving yourself away in service and ministry to others it is putting off the
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:13.880]   selfish isolation that would lead to involvement with this sin and putting on
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:20.680]   true fellowship with brothers and sisters in Christ in the local church as
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:27.200]   Heath Lambert says all involvement with pornography is an expression of pride
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.880]   and so we want to help the counselee put off pride and arrogance and to put on
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:42.000]   humility and lowly lowliness of life of mind and so just think through those
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.480]   categories of put off put on one possible way to structure this
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.840]   counseling exam is to work through in a first paragraph your first session
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.680]   homework assignments and then work through in a second paragraph further
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:04.000]   assignments that you would give to help Eric or Erica work through this
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.320]   counseling issue and and then a third paragraph deal with the concepts of put
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.080]   off and put on that you're not going to be satisfied with your counselee just
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.320]   merely abstaining from pornography but you want to help the counselee put on
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.680]   Christlike virtue and Christlike character and become humble and
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:33.240]   selfless and involved in fellowship and engaged in a pursuit of God and a
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.480]   passion for Christlikeness and the worship of Christ and so that is the
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:46.560]   first case study which is the case study of Eric let me move to the second case
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.080]   study that is presented in the counseling exams and this is the case
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:58.880]   study of Sarah the case study says this Sarah is a 34 year old married mother of
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:05.080]   three who comes to you for help with depression she says that she has been
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.400]   feeling terribly sad for the last six months and has a lot of trouble keeping
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.000]   up with life she came to you seeking the opinion of a biblical counselor on what
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.960]   she should do Sarah has several friends who received antidepressants from their
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.920]   family doctor the medicine seemed to help for a while but they also
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.640]   experienced some unpleasant side effects that she is concerned about she asks you
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:42.400]   explicitly do you think I should see my doctor about taking an antidepressant
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:50.800]   and so the case study with Sarah deals with the issue of depression and the
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:58.760]   related issue of the Christian and psychotropic drugs or antidepressants in
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:04.160]   this case now if you've been with us in our study of year one and year two you
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.620]   know that this is material that we have covered both in our year one training
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:15.960]   and in our year two training we had a section on depression in our year one
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.480]   training and then also session dealing with Christians and psychotropic
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:28.080]   medications we then did a review of that material in our year two training I
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:34.100]   believe that was counseling exam number five we dealt again with the issue of
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:41.200]   depression and the related issue of psychotropic drugs so we would want you
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.560]   to simply review that material I will suggest to you to go back to counseling
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.080]   exam number five and just review the session that we looked at in that
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:23:01.000]   counseling exam and then relate that material to the case study of Sarah who
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.240]   is asking if she should take an antidepressant for her struggle with
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.200]   depression now just remember some of the material we covered in those sessions
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   our definition of depression Gary Gilley writes that depression can be defined as
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:26.200]   that debilitating mood feeling or air of hopelessness which results in a ceasing
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:31.480]   of the handling of life he continues that a depressed person may want to
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.760]   sleep all the time you may cry easily you may stop going to work or doing a
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.280]   necessary task around the house you may stop eating or eat constantly he will
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:51.400]   feel that life is hopeless and so in the case of Sarah the exam question is this
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.120]   how would you respond to this question the question is do you think I should
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.720]   see my doctor about taking an antidepressant and then write out your
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:08.280]   answer exactly as you would provide it to Sarah so what we want you to do in
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:15.240]   this exam question is to go ahead and imagine yourself in a counseling room
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.880]   having a counseling session with Sarah and then just type out verbally what
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.120]   would be the language you would use to talk to Sarah and to walk her through
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:34.880]   the issue of depression and psychotropic drugs for example your essay might begin
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.600]   with some type of language like Sarah I'm so sorry to hear about your
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:49.000]   struggles with depression and then go on from there addressing Sarah in the
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:58.080]   counseling essay the counseling exam question let me just remind you to enter
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:05.040]   the counselee's world as you write out a response to Sarah make sure to give a
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:11.840]   compassionate response if depression is that debilitating mood feeling or air of
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:18.160]   hopelessness which results in a ceasing of the handling of life enter the
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.400]   council's world and see life through her eyes and make sure to give a
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:30.440]   compassionate response I will suggest to you to remind the counselee that she is
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   not alone we talked about this principle in our overview of depression in session
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.560]   number five the number of Saints who have struggled with depression throughout
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:49.400]   redemptive history we talked about the fact that Job experienced some type of
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:57.080]   depression as he walked through this great season of suffering and sorrow we
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.440]   looked at the psalmist in Psalm 88 verse 3 who said for my soul is full of
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.320]   troubles and my life draws near to Sheol in verse 7 he says your wrath lies
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:16.840]   heavy upon me and you overwhelm me with all your waves verse 18 you have caused
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.340]   my beloved and my friend to shun me my companions have become darkness and so
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:29.960]   what's helpful in relating to a person like Sarah is just to remind her that
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:36.080]   you're not alone many Christians have wrestled with seasons of despair seasons
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:42.560]   of sorrow seasons in which there is some experience of spiritual darkness we
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.380]   think of even great men of God like ch Spurgeon who wrestled with depression
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.840]   William Cooper we mentioned in our session number five who wrote great
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.880]   hymns of the faith and yet wrestled with great spiritual darkness and so forth
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:07.320]   and so on many examples of Christians who have wrestled with great periods of
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:15.360]   darkness and despair and so just giving a compassion response just assuring the
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.240]   counselee that she is not alone assuring the counselee the Bible does address
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.400]   this issue and that the Bible does address this issue in a way that is
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:34.200]   compassionate and merciful and that our goal again is not to remove the
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.440]   depression per se but our goal is to help the counselee to walk with God
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:46.000]   through seasons of sorrow and spiritual darkness now as it relates to the
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.360]   specific question of do you think I should see my doctor about taking an
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:57.720]   antidepressant let me refer you to the session number five where we did cover
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.320]   some of this material as to how we might handle the issue of psychotropic drugs
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.320]   we did look there at two extreme views extreme view number one is that
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.280]   Christians should never take psychotropic medications and that would
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:20.080]   be a view I myself would not take because I don't find any command in the
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.600]   Bible that says thou shalt not take any psychotropic medications and if there's
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.080]   not a command in the Bible that says that then I definitely don't want to
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:35.520]   make up one on my own this view holds that the problem is always spiritual in
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.320]   nature and should only be addressed through spiritual means as we work
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.000]   through counselees with counselees and counseling ministry we just have to be
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.760]   really careful with that we don't always know that the problem is 100% spiritual
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.640]   it there may be a physical issue here there may be a true medical condition
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.840]   such as hypothyroidism or there might be undiagnosed diabetes or they might be a
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.440]   side effect from a medication there may be a true medical issue that needs to be
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.880]   addressed and therefore we just want to be careful about concluding that the
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:22.100]   problem is spiritual if we don't have all the information on the opposite side
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.200]   you have the extreme view that psychotropic drugs are the only answer
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   for Christians this view would hold that the problems only physical in nature and
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:38.760]   therefore the answer is merely chemical and biological so it's one thing on one
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:47.480]   hand to say well you should never take a psychotropic drug that that is clearly
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:54.080]   sin we do not want to say that because the Bible doesn't say that but on the
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.880]   other hand you can go to the extreme and saying that all of my problems will be
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:05.900]   solved if I simply take a psychotropic drug or psychotropic medication and we
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.680]   just want to be aware of the extremes we could come to as it relates to this
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:17.720]   issue and find a balanced we gave you a proposed balanced view realizing that
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.880]   man is both spiritual and physical in nature we don't want to add extra
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.080]   biblical standards to the Word of God we want to beware of having a judgmental
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   attitude when it comes to extra biblical standards I don't want to ever tell a
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.480]   counselee you shouldn't take psychotropic medications because I don't
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.880]   have the authority to do that from Scripture and I also don't want to
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   unfairly judge a counselee who may have different convinced convictions on that
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:54.400]   subject then I do Romans 14 says we are not to judge one another as it relates
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.680]   to disputable issues which are not clearly spelled out in Scripture we want
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.040]   to realize that counselees have a wide spectrum of attitudes towards taking
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.800]   psychotropic medication we realize that medication can be a common grace measure
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.720]   to treat the symptoms of depression depression is sometimes a physical issue
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:21.240]   but it is always a spiritual issue and so our goal is to minister the Word of
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:28.760]   God to the heart medication is not a gospel blocker and so this is material
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.400]   we've covered already what we're asking you to do in this counseling question is
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.920]   to take this balance for you and then in your own words communicate to Sarah a
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:47.760]   view of medication that would strike this balance of we don't prohibit what
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:55.280]   God's Word doesn't prohibit but we also don't want to place all of our hope in a
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.880]   drug in an idolatrous way in saying that this drug has all of my confidence and
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.520]   all of my trust we want to bring a balanced biblical view to that
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.440]   discussion and that question is asking you to do that in your own words
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:20.160]   speaking to Sarah how would you shepherd her through that through that topic as
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.200]   you look at the next question question number 14 the question is what means
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.640]   would you use to find out more information about Sarah's current
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:38.400]   problem what information would you seek this is relating to the key element of
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.960]   inventory one of the six eyes of biblical counseling what kind of
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.220]   questions would you ask Sarah what are the categories of information that you
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:54.000]   would be seeking to understand as it relates to a counseling issue you will
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.680]   remember that inventory we defined as the ministry of active intentional
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:07.040]   listening to a counselee's thoughts emotions and feelings so as to minister
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.920]   to that person with knowledge and understanding we covered the preach
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.600]   acronym by Wayne Mac just categories of information that we might seek to
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.920]   understand as it relates to Sarah's issues physical resources and
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:32.680]   relationships emotions and feelings there is actions behavior conceptual
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.280]   thinking goals values desires and motives and then there is the historical
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:45.240]   view of Sarah's life the good and bad in past context present context failure
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:52.960]   school and job problems you will remember some basic skill sets of good
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:59.800]   inventory we told you to ask don't assume make sure that you invite the
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.680]   counselee into the situ into the conversation without prejudging the
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:11.280]   counselee and assuming a certain truth that may or may not be true learn to ask
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.680]   open-ended questions instead of close-ended question and then learn to
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:23.100]   utilize both extensive questions as well as intensive questions you'll remember
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.920]   we covered the whole idea that as it relates to Sarah you might want to find
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:36.160]   out an extensive ask extensive questions that kind of summarize the history of
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:42.120]   Sarah's life I might want to find out is this struggle with depression is it a
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.560]   lifelong issue has it been going on for a decade or more or is it really a
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.400]   recent development if Sarah says something to the effect of I never
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.080]   struggled with depression I just started struggling with depression three months
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.160]   ago and before that there really was not an issue then I'm gonna be asking
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.680]   intensive questions as to what happened exactly three months ago what are the
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:14.480]   physical things the relational things the emotional events that happened three
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.520]   months ago that may have triggered this spiraling down of a person's thoughts
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:27.600]   and emotions into a type of depression you will remember that we taught you in
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:34.960]   the three tree diagram that the concepts of heat and heart and root and fruit and
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.680]   that a good line of questioning moves from the external situation that a
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:47.360]   counselee is encountering the heat of life to the behavioral issues the
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.320]   external actions of behavior and then into the heart or the root issues of
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:36:01.120]   life and so as it relates to Sarah's condition I would want to find out when
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:07.720]   did the depression start were there are physical stresses as it relates to the
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:14.840]   the timing of when the depression really became intense is Sarah sleeping what is
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:20.600]   her schedule like what are the spiritual stresses upon her life are there any
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.840]   real spiritual battles that she is encountering in her Christian life I'd
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.520]   want to also find out things like broadly what is her salvation testimony
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.640]   when does she come to know the Lord what are the fruits and the evidences of her
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:45.840]   salvation I would want to use a personal data inventory form a PDI to find out
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:55.280]   more about Sarah's life and what she is going through if she is married and does
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:01.520]   say here that she is a married mother of three I would want to get permission to
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.680]   ask for the husband's input and his perspective on the situation those are
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.600]   just some avenues of data gathering and inventory that I might want to employ in
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.880]   learning more about Sarah's current problem and then just generally I would
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.560]   want to find out from any counselee what is the counselees church involvement how
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.480]   is the counselee serving how many times does the counselee attend worship
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.120]   services is the counselee in a small group who are the relationships that are
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:39.280]   ministering to this person spiritually what is the counselee reading in the
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:46.120]   Word of God is there a regular intake of Scripture and how is the counselee
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:52.920]   engaged in serving others those are some general diagnostic types of questions
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:59.400]   that I would be asking to know what is the spiritual condition of the counselee
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:07.000]   as we look at number 15 exam question number 15 the question is carefully
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.560]   described whether and how you would want to work with a physician to help Sarah
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.960]   through this ordeal as part of your answer to this specific question
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:23.160]   described in general terms how you believe biblical counselors should
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.880]   cooperate with medical professionals now again this is a review of previous
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.800]   information we looked previously at the whole concept that man is material and
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   immaterial that man is physical and spiritual if you work through the
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.120]   theology exam questions with us you wrote an entire essay on the the idea
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.880]   that man is material and immaterial that the material side of man is always
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:57.280]   relating to and interacting with the immaterial side of man that man has a
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   soul and man has a body and therefore we as biblical counselors we are not
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   medical physicians we are not tasked to give medication to the to the body we
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.780]   are not tasked to prescribe certain medications or treatments to the
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:24.680]   physical body that we will partner with medical professionals to treat who treat
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:31.040]   the body and our focus is really on ministering the Word of God to the soul
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.920]   and so while we are tasked as biblical counselors to minister the Word of God
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:44.040]   to the immaterial side of man the soul or the heart we do want to be aware of
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.080]   what is happening physically with the counselee and so we will ask a
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:54.800]   counselee as part of homework assignment to go see a medical physician to get a
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:01.880]   thorough medical assessment and we just want to eliminate physical causes for a
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:10.720]   person's depression and so as Tom Maxim has written there are physical causes
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:17.680]   for depression such as side effect from medication a true medical problem
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:25.920]   diseases and medical conditions such as hypoglycemia there might be undiagnosed
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:33.200]   cancer or other issues there might be the a chronic pain issue from an illness
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.080]   or injury and so forth and so on so we just want to partner with medical
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:46.120]   professionals in order to rule out physical causes for Sarah's depression
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.360]   so that we might focus on the spiritual causes and minister the Word of God to
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:41:00.200]   the heart now if you go to AC BC's statement on mental illness and medicine
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.680]   that's available at the biblical counseling calm website again that's the
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:12.280]   AC BC statement on mental illness and medicine AC BC has a statement there
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.920]   that is very balanced that talks through what how a biblical counselor might
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:28.880]   partner with a medical professional and in that statement the this the AC BC
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   statement says this I'll just quote a portion of it says that biblical
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.560]   counselors must acknowledge the human being struggle with physical and
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:44.760]   spiritual problems biblical counselor shall encourage the use of physical
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:51.000]   examinations and testing by physicians for diagnosis of medical problems the
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.240]   treatment of these problems and the relief of symptoms which might cause
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:02.360]   contribute to or complicate counseling issues so that's a good statement to
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   read to quote you might want to quote that statement in your essay and that
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:13.200]   will give a good balanced perspective on how a biblical counselor might partner
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:21.760]   with a medical professional to help a counselee like Sarah okay let me move to
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:29.400]   the third case study and this is the case study of Tim and Emily and let's
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.080]   just talk through this case study I'll give you some pointers to write the last
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:39.080]   three essays but this is the longest case study in the sequence so here we go
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.680]   Tim and Emily come from a church across town and I've asked to meet you because
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.800]   of some help that you offered their friends several months ago they are
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.760]   coming because of a persistent problem they have had in their marriage they
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:59.960]   explain that in their six years of marriage Tim has always had a short fuse
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:05.120]   a pause at this point you will note in the course of this case study the
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.440]   language of short fuse is relating to the issue of sinful anger and so in
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.880]   order to address this case study please go back to the session we completed on
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:22.360]   sinful anger I am forgetting the number that was I believe that was session
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.080]   number six or session number seven go back and review that material and relate
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:32.600]   that material to the case study of Tim and Emily Tim going back to the case
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:39.280]   study has always had a short fuse he regularly loses it when he comes home
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.320]   from work which fills the evenings with tense communication their weeks are
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.200]   filled with arguments about everything from dinner being ready on time to
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.840]   whether they should have kids Tim thinks Emily is a good wife admits the problems
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:58.960]   are his fault but says he just doesn't know how to maintain control about a
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.560]   year ago Tim went berserk screaming at Emily kicking the kitchen table and
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.000]   throwing plates on the floor in response to Emily's complaint that he came home
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.320]   late without calling Emily was always uncomfortable with Tim's previous
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.640]   pattern of outbursts with this was different she was truly scared Tim was
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:26.040]   too in tears she told Tim that something had to change Tim talked to his pastor
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.440]   who told him that he needed to see a professional therapist which sadly is
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.480]   the route that many churches take in dealing with an issue like this to refer
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:45.000]   them outside of the church to a an integrationist counselor who bills
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.960]   himself or herself as a Christian therapist Tim followed the advice and
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.560]   made an appointment with the Christian counselor whom his pastor recommended
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.000]   Tim met with the therapist for a few sessions who ultimately recommended he
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.920]   see a psychiatrist for medical care when Tim met with a psychiatrist he was told
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:11.000]   that he had bipolar disorder and began to take the medications prescribed by
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.040]   the physician so you will want to note we had a section on sinful anger you
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:23.560]   wanna you'll want to keep that material fresh in your mind as you relate to Tim
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.920]   and Emily you will note we also had a section on bipolar depression as part of
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:34.920]   the depression study and you'll want to keep that information handy as well and
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:40.520]   if you need more information on bipolar disorder you will want to read Charles
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.760]   Hodge's book good mood bad mood you will want to review his section on bipolar
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:52.160]   disorder just so you know how to handle that topic but those are the two
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.200]   categories of information that we will need to bring to bear upon this case
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:05.880]   study of Tim and Emily so Tim has what by all accounts seems like a an out-of-
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.400]   control anger problem he's gone to a psychiatrist who has given him a
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.560]   psychological diagnosis of bipolar disorder he has been placed on
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:23.280]   medication in order to deal with this problem let's continue on in the case
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.880]   study Tim was initially discouraged to learn he had a disease that would likely
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.520]   last his entire life but he was thankful to have a plan to deal with the problem
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.480]   Emily was also encouraged that there was now at least something they could do
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:42.400]   the encouragement quickly gave way however when after several months on the
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:48.480]   medication Tim had still not really changed well as temperament seemed
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:55.800]   milder in general the loss of control and screaming were still present it was
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:03.360]   at this point that Emily began to regret ever marrying Tim all the arguments
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.660]   together with a couple's lack of children were taking their toll she
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.040]   realized she was in a marriage that she did not want to be in but didn't think
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:17.120]   she had any options so you see here the compounding of problem upon problem
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:24.440]   which is typical in life and in counseling ministry then last week Tim
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:30.680]   went completely crazy Emily suggested on a Saturday morning that Tim should cut
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.240]   the grass because he had not done it the week before Tim did more than scream and
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.400]   throw things this time as he yelled and became more worked up he threw the phone
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:45.960]   at Emily he missed her knocking a hole in the wall but they both knew he had
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:52.360]   crossed a line Emily said she couldn't take it anymore and wanted out of the
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   marriage she told him that if something didn't change very quickly she was going
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:04.000]   to leave that is when he reached out to his friend who recommended you Tim and
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Emily both profess faith in Christ and relate their testimonies of conversion
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.800]   in their teen years both are also terribly discouraged Tim doesn't know
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:19.600]   how to treat Emily better since he is plagued by this disease Emily loves Tim
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.640]   and would like their marriage to work but she is worn out with the lack of
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.040]   change she feels badly about wanting to leave because she knows he has an
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:34.000]   illness but she is increasingly convinced that God is telling her to
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.120]   divorce Tim so a number of issues here there's a lot going on we're gonna work
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:48.600]   through this step by step and we are asking you as part of this counseling
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:57.520]   exam package to write I believe it is five essays on this subject so let's
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:03.400]   take this step by step and look at counseling exam number 16 which is the
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:10.960]   first issue how will you decide whether to pursue Tim and Emily as believers and
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.120]   unbelievers what difference will their status as Christians make in your
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.920]   counseling so that's the first step is it not is we want to determine whether
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:25.840]   we are counseling believers or unbelievers why is that important it's
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:32.040]   important because you do not want to be trying to pull out spiritual fruit from
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:39.640]   a spiritually dead unregenerate person if that is a recipe for frustration in
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:46.040]   biblical counseling so you want to get a good salvation testimony you want to
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:54.360]   understand how well do the counselees understand articulate the gospel you
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:00.280]   want to be get an understanding of their salvation testimony is there a clear
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:07.120]   before I knew Christ this is how I came to know Christ and then this is how my
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.240]   life was like after I placed my faith in Jesus Christ I was a new creation and I
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:18.800]   began to bear spiritual fruit you want to ask diagnostic questions such as if
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.960]   you were to die today and God were to ask you why should I let you into my
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.200]   heaven what would you say and I have asked many people that in meetings and
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:36.400]   in counseling ministry and you'll be surprised at the number of differing
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:42.480]   responses you get to that question what you want to hear something like the only
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:49.920]   reason I should be allowed into God's heaven is because of the work of Jesus
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:55.240]   Christ on the cross on my behalf and because he paid for my sin at Calvary
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:01.080]   and died on the cross for me by grace alone through faith alone that is the
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:06.240]   only way that I will ever be allowed into heaven that it is not by my works
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.820]   that I am saved but you'll be surprised at how many people answer something very
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:18.240]   vague or general or something that is related to their their church attendance
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:23.360]   or the number of works that they have done for the community or just things
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:28.040]   that really do not nail down the gospel with any type of precision so you will
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:34.000]   want to find out whether Tim and Emily have a clear understanding of the
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.720]   gospel now this makes a huge difference why is that because if Tim and Emily are
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:50.380]   unbelievers then we can't offer any hope for change until they come to the saving
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:55.880]   knowledge of Jesus Christ if Tim and Emily are unbelievers then as it as sad
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:01.080]   as it is to say they have a much bigger problem than their broken marriage that
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:06.560]   they are enemies of God and they are under the wrath and the condemnation of
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.280]   God's law and if they were to die today then they would face the judgment and
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.160]   condemnation of eternity in hell and they would not be have the hope of going
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.600]   to heaven and so if they are unbelievers then their greatest problem is that they
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.320]   need Christ and they need to be saved and they need the gospel they need to be
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.160]   forgiven other sins and place their faith in Jesus Christ and we can't offer
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.960]   the hope that their marriage will change apart from them coming to the saving
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.680]   knowledge of Christ however on the other hand if Tim and Emily are believers then
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.140]   we have the assurance of all that what scripture has said regarding the
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.920]   believer in Christ that they are new creations in Christ that they have the
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:57.720]   Holy Spirit dwelling in them that they have received all the promises of God in
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:02.320]   the scriptures that they have been forgiven of their sins that their future
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.280]   hope is in heaven and because they have received all the blessings of the
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.320]   gospel and that they ever they are united to Christ in his life death and
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:20.320]   resurrection then we can offer hope for change and that Tim and Emily can have
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.920]   their marriage restored and that they can forgive one another and they can
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.520]   experience unity and fellowship with one another and fellowship with Christ
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:34.880]   because of what Christ has done for them and so what difference does this make it
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.840]   makes all the difference in the world whether you understand Tim and Emily as
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.400]   believers or unbelievers I would be wanting to find out here with Tim is
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   this issue of anger characteristic of every other issue in his life in other
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.160]   words is Tim bearing fruit in other areas of his life as a Christian but
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:03.000]   he's just really struggling with this one particular issue or is there a
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.440]   pattern of just a lack of fruit in every area of his life we are not saved by our
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.120]   fruit but spiritual fruit is the evidence of spiritual life that is
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:19.960]   residing in the soul we are not saved by our good works but we are saved unto
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:26.080]   good works and so I would be wanting to find out where is the spiritual fruit in
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:33.000]   Tim and Emily's life moving to counseling exam number 17 describe as
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.680]   fully as you are able your strategy to help Tim and Emily think biblically
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:46.000]   about his diagnosis and their use of bipolar and illness language now bipolar
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.080]   disorder I don't know if I have the source here but it has been defined as a
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:58.880]   behavior pattern in which a depressed individual experiences at least one
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:05.360]   episode of exaggerated mood elevation this is called the manic episode the
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.500]   dominant feature of bipolar disorder that's from Marshall and Mary Asher's
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:16.680]   book the Christian's guide to psychological terms and so in bipolar
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:25.600]   you have depression which is which leads to a manic phase and then back to
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:32.560]   depression and so from the psychiatrist perspective Tim may be swinging from
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:40.540]   these episodes of depression into these manic episodes of which present
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:51.200]   themselves in unbridled anger the biblical evaluation of Tim's behavior I
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:58.640]   believe if if you go back to our session on sinful anger this really is
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:09.180]   uncontrolled anger it is what scripture calls outbursts of anger and we would
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:14.840]   want to deal with the issue using biblical terms and biblical
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:23.200]   descriptions of Tim's behavior labeling Tim with a psychological illness
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:30.880]   minimizes his personal responsibility in the matter and also removes genuine
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:41.160]   hope for change if Tim is Tim's behavior can be explained solely due to his
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:48.240]   illness in this way then he has an illness that is to be managed rather
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:55.920]   than a sin that needs to be repented of Tim would feel that he has a disease
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.880]   that will last his entire life and that disease can only be managed rather than
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.480]   dealing with the issue in a straightforward biblical manner that he
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:14.680]   has a sin issue of unbridled anger that needs to be repented of Ephesians 4
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.000]   verse 31 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.320]   away from you along with all malice be kind to one another tenderhearted
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:28.600]   forgiving one another just as God in Christ forgave you and so all the
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:34.280]   different forms of anger there is bitterness a long-standing resentment
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:41.560]   wrath which scribes a passion and agitated type of anger there is anger
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:47.560]   translates Greek term or gay which talks about the deep resentment that seeds and
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:53.440]   smolders clamor referring to the shout of cry or strife and outbursts that
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:58:00.480]   reveals a loss of self-control that word would describe Tim's behavior here
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:06.760]   slander literally evil speaking to speak of others so as to harm or defame malice
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:13.120]   wishing evil on others and Paul says that that all bitterness and wrath and
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.040]   anger and clamor and slander is to be put away from you a verb that refers to
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.760]   a decisive definitive action that needs to be carried out with a sense of
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:29.800]   urgency whatever the psychological diagnosis is if Tim is a true believer
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:36.640]   in Christ filled with the Holy Spirit he is called to put away to decisively
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:47.280]   put off all forms of anger bitterness wrath anger clamor slander and then he
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   is called to put on kindness he used to be kind to his wife he used to be
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:59.600]   tenderhearted and he is to forgive just as he has been forgiven and because he
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.680]   is a believer he not only is called to that type of behavior he also has the
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:12.960]   power and the resources to live in this way if sin is the problem then Christ is
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:20.120]   the solution the diagnosis of sin is catch this the most hopeful diagnosis
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.280]   that we can give to a counselee because the Bible teaches that we have an
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:31.260]   all-sufficient Savior who has died on the cross and risen again in order to
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:37.320]   make atonement for our sin and to free us from both the penalty and the power
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:45.760]   of sin if Tim simply obeys the straightforward commands to put off
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:52.160]   anger and wrath and clamor and slander and to put on kindness and
[00:59:52.160 --> 01:00:00.320]   tenderheartedness toward his wife that marriage between Tim and Emily will be
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.960]   transformed and so I would be encouraging you to think through this
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:13.240]   counseling exam in relation to how do you help a counselee deal with sinful
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:21.920]   anger and and deal with the issue as a sin that needs to be repented of rather
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:29.400]   than in illness that needs to be managed now just as a side note you can do all
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.560]   of that without even getting into the discussion of should Tim be seeing a
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:39.400]   psychiatrist or should Tim be seeing a psychologist I wouldn't even be trying
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.280]   to debate any of that I wouldn't be getting into the debate of do you have a
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.360]   bipolar disorder or do you not I wouldn't even be getting into any of that
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.680]   as I do biblical counseling I would just be dealing with the issues as the Bible
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.080]   addresses them what is Tim's behavior how does the Bible describe that
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.360]   behavior and then letting scripture speak into that situation and I wouldn't
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.080]   even get being sidetracked into the whole discussion of well do you have
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.320]   bipolar do you not a bipolar or should you take the medication or should you
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.600]   not take the medication I wouldn't let myself get into all those rabbit trails
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.360]   I would just be dealing with the issues straightforward as the Bible deals with
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.640]   those issues I think that's our role as biblical counselors is just to minister
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:31.360]   the Word of God let me move quickly to number 18 Emily is convinced that God is
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.120]   telling her to divorce Tim write out your word-for-word response to Emily on
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.280]   this matter in your response be sure to address the themes of biblical
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:47.360]   decision-making and permission for divorce and remarriage two main concepts
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:54.680]   that you want to bring into this exam concept number one is that God tells us
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:02.760]   what to do through his written word and not apart from his written word and so
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:10.880]   you want to go back to the session we did in ACBC theology exam number 22 the
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.280]   Holy Spirit and guidance the main point in a session was that the Holy Spirit
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.760]   guides us through his written word not apart from his written word the Holy
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.160]   Spirit inspire the written word and so the Holy Spirit guides us as we
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.520]   understand and read and apply the written word not apart from the written
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:40.720]   word of Scripture and so if Emily is convinced that God is telling her to
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.180]   divorce Tim then you will need to help Emily understand that God only tells us
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:51.640]   what to do as we read and understand his written word and God does not speak to
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.840]   us apart from the written word of Scripture many passages we looked at in
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:03.120]   that session I'll let you review that on your own the second foundational idea
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.200]   that you're gonna want to bring into this exam is a biblical understanding of
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:14.160]   divorce and remarriage I've given to you a reference on your handout from Grace
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.720]   Community Church's statement on divorce and remarriage I would encourage you to
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:25.520]   review that we covered some of that in our discussion of the year one training
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.840]   on marriage looking at the two exceptions that is what my church's
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.520]   doctrinal statement holds to is the same as the Grace Community Church statement
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:44.960]   holding to the two exception clauses or the two exceptions to a to the divorce
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.880]   allowing for divorce giving permission for divorce not giving an encouragement
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:56.040]   to divorce or a prescription to divorce but giving an allowance there that would
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:01.840]   protect the innocent party the first exception is when one spouse engages in
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:09.400]   unrepentant adultery and the innocent spouse is permitted as a protection to
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.280]   divorce and to remarry and then the second exception would be if believer is
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.040]   married to an unbeliever and the unbeliever departs all of that is found
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.880]   in the Grace Community Church statement you will want to review that and talk
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:31.520]   through how the Bible addresses the issue of divorce and then the question
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.640]   is write out a word-for-word response to Emily on this matter so we're asking you
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:44.720]   to possibly do one longer paragraph talking through Emily of how God speaks
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.800]   to her only through the written word and then the second part of that exam
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:56.480]   question would be what does the Word of God actually say about divorce and
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:03.600]   remarriage quickly now to counseling exam number 19 what strategy would you
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:10.360]   employ to see repentance reconciliation and restoration happen between Tim and
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:18.540]   Emily I'd refer you here to the peacemaker materials by Ken Sandy which
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:26.460]   is also referred to in the work pursuing peace by Robert Jones look up in both
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:32.600]   the peacemaker and pursuing peace the seven A's of confession I believe I have
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   this on a slide here no I don't but the seven A's of confession is very helpful
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:46.440]   address everyone involved avoid if but and maybe admit specifically acknowledge
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.920]   the hurt accept its consequences alter your behavior and ask for forgiveness
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.800]   and so the two concepts you want to bring into this exam question is how do
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:04.760]   you do a good confession and then how do you biblically forgive so biblical
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:10.280]   confession and biblical forgiveness are the two ingredients to biblical
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:16.360]   reconciliation where there is true confession and true forgiveness you have
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:25.040]   true reconciliation and so working with Tim and Emily for Tim to give a a true
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:31.640]   confession of sin using biblical terms avoiding if but and maybe admitting
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:37.840]   specifically acknowledging the hurt and then helping Emily to forgive biblically
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.440]   both and unconditionally from the heart and then extending conditional
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:52.480]   forgiveness based upon Tim's confession and bring about true reconciliation so
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:57.920]   the two parts there are biblical confession and biblical forgiveness
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.960]   both sections have material that I covered in the year one training and I'd
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:10.440]   encourage you to review that material last but not least exhales exam number
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:16.520]   20 describe a detailed plan of restoring marital communication that you would
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:22.160]   pursue with Tim and Emily this question is going back to the concept of homework
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:31.040]   as we saw in counseling exam number 12 how would you assign specific homework
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:37.000]   that would be for the purpose of restoring marital communication so again
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.800]   thinking through the concepts of Bible reading Bible memorization specific
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:49.080]   assignments a very helpful work here is Wayne max strengthening your marriage
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:53.720]   there is a unit there in the book strengthening your marriage on
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:08:00.920]   communication I would be reviewing that unit in preparation to write this essay
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.660]   exam and just reviewing those concepts and then he has a number of good
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:10.400]   homework assignments that are related to the issue of communication and so just
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.480]   thinking of the concepts of what are the passages you would want him and Emily to
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.040]   read what are the verses you would want them to memorize what are some of the
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.420]   books or booklets you would want them to to read and to apply Stuart Scott has a
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.120]   good little booklet called communication and conflict resolution that would be
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.760]   again another good resource to read and review in preparation for this essay
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:44.360]   exam and then getting really practical such as setting a time and a place to
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.960]   talk once once a week if they're struggling with communication then
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.680]   perhaps they need a specific assignment like a date night or even just a time
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.440]   after the kids have gone to bed for them to have coffee or to have tea and to and
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.840]   to talk to one another for 15 or 30 minutes and then you can increase those
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:08.160]   homework assignments as they go along but here again you are writing out some
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.920]   detailed homework assignments that would help Tim and Emily restore marital
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:20.160]   communication and that brings us to the end of our case studies and the end of
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:26.760]   our counseling exams which also means that this is the end of our class I just
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.200]   wanted to take a moment and congratulate you for making it to the end of this
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.240]   class and and just thank you again for your faithfulness and studying the Word
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   of God with me we began having the seminar online because of some of the
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:50.080]   kovat restrictions and our inability to meet in person and yet God has used this
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.240]   online format to introduce us to a number of friends that are not only here
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.720]   in Southern California but all across the country and even internationally
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.560]   we've been hearing that there are some who are in different countries who are
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.840]   tuning in to this webinar and and it is a joy to be able to count you as friends
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:18.480]   I love to would see would love to see many of you at the ACBC National
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.920]   Conference in the fall I know that this year's conference is in North Carolina
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:28.600]   and if not this year then perhaps in a year to come we will be able to
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:33.880]   fellowship in person but I do want to thank you for joining me and this has
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.000]   been a wonderful privilege to study these with you this morning I had a joy
