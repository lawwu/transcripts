[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.280]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast where I try to help you achieve financial
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.120]   freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.120]   Today I have a special guest with me, Andre Nader, who I interviewed a year ago after
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.080]   he left Metta.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.240]   And so I wanted to talk to him about life after Metta, what he's been doing with his
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.000]   newsletter, his thoughts on semi-retirement, FIRE, as well as how it's like having a
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.980]   wife who works in tech and who makes a lot of money.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.880]   So welcome to the show again, Andre.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.800]   Thank you so much, Sam, for having me back.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.400]   So what's been going on since a year, since we last spoke?
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.080]   Yeah, we're coming pretty close to exactly a year since we last talked.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.980]   And a lot has changed over that year.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.840]   We spoke literally while I was on my severance after being laid off from Metta, being laid
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.600]   off in May of 2023 and then having the severance through the summer.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360]   And I was still trying to get my bearings.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.200]   I had been at Facebook Metta for nine plus years, in tech for 15 years, working continuously,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.680]   had always had a job since I was 16.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.800]   So when we talked, that was the first time ever in the last 15, 20 years that I had time
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.280]   to do what I wanted, or even just like just had time period.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.320]   And it definitely wasn't just what I wanted.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.080]   I'm married, I have a six-year-old daughter, the restrictions on my time are obviously
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.960]   capped on both ends.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   But the last year has been really interesting and a good reflection on how I think about
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.060]   FIRE and it's kind of changed my mindset a little bit.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.040]   And I'm looking forward to chatting more about all that.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.720]   Tell me about the severance package because one of my roles if you're planning on retiring
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.240]   early is to try to negotiate a severance package because if you're planning on quitting anyway,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.440]   there's no downside to trying to negotiate a severance package.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.720]   So you got a severance package.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   Could you refresh the rough details if you're allowed and how that made you feel during
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.640]   your transition to no longer working?
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   No, the severance package was very generous.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.800]   I think the benefit that I had was I was, I don't know if it's a benefit, Metta went
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.920]   through three plus rounds of layoffs.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.420]   So I was in one of the final rounds.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.480]   What that afforded me was having a very clear picture of what the severance offers were
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   looking like.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.420]   At that point, they were very cookie cutter standard.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.200]   You knew exactly what you were going to be getting.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   There wasn't really too much room for negotiation unless you had some kind of extenuating circumstances.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:56.480]   So the general package was one, being in California, we had the 60 days from the layoff period
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.600]   just by nature of like the Warren Act in terms of the amount of notice that they must give
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.400]   you before they do a mass layoff.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.780]   So what they do is say that you're laid off in the end of May, but they still keep you
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.360]   on payroll just like you're getting a normal paycheck for the next 60 days.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.160]   So that's all even before the normal severance.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.520]   And then on top of that, they were giving I think around three additional months of
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.920]   full salary plus six months of health insurance and then two weeks for every year that you
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920]   worked there.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.500]   So I was there for nine years.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580]   So ended up being like a fairly substantial amount.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.000]   For the entire year, I made probably like 80%, 85% of my total comp that I would have
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.720]   gotten anyway if I worked the entire year.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.340]   And I only worked through May.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.480]   So it ended up being a fairly, like you were saying, if you're going to fire, like doing
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   a severance type fire, working your package, I didn't intentionally do this, but it ended
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.560]   up being a fairly good way to exit, if you will.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   And the health insurance was a big piece too.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.320]   And what did you do with the money?
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.480]   Honestly, I treated it just like a normal salary that I was getting.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.840]   I didn't do anything differently.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.280]   So for me, it's always been very cookie cutter.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.200]   I'm a bogglehead by heart, index funds, put it in to max out all my retirement accounts.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.360]   But by May, I'd already maxed out all of those.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   So it was just really beefing up my taxable savings, which again, like all within like
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.120]   Fidelity, Vanguard, the standard VTI, VOO, also beefing up my emergency fund.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.240]   So I think that was the big change too, is I had been a dual income household, which
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.800]   meant that I had a little bit of security from if I lost my job, my wife still had her
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   job.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   So we didn't need to have, say like a year of savings.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.520]   My emergency fund was probably around six months of our essential expenses.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.040]   But now after being laid off, one of the things I used the money for was, hey, now we're a
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   single income household.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.400]   It's fine if I lose my job.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.740]   We had always been very disciplined around keeping our expenses within one of our salaries.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.400]   So we had no issue maintaining our current lifestyle.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.200]   But if she lost her job as well, that might change.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.920]   So I increased my emergency fund up to 12 months and just had additional like cash buffer
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.640]   just in case, because I think the future at that time was less than certain.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.760]   Right, right, right.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.180]   And so what do you think your after tax savings rate fell to once you lost or once you left
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.180]   Meta?
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.340]   Yeah, the after tax savings rate, still north of 40 plus percent, still able to max out
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.360]   all of my wife's retirement accounts, including the mega backdoor after tax.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:59.320]   So we're talking about contributing that $69,000 there plus backdoor Roths, which is 7k per
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.680]   person plus more in addition to that.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   Wow.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.680]   40% still.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.380]   So still, again, within San Francisco, we had always kept our expenses within reason.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.120]   And then the honest truth is that our tax salaries, me at Meta and then her at Uber,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.840]   had just continued to grow over that time period, over the, like she has been at Uber
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.800]   for almost a decade as well.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:30.400]   So we have two, not executive level, but like senior level employees at big tech earning
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.540]   a good living and keeping our expenses in check, like our largest expenses, rent being
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.280]   in San Francisco, and then childcare followed by groceries.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.760]   So within reason, keeping those within check had allowed us to continue to save and be
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.160]   prepared for a situation like this where we dropped to an income, because ultimately my
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   goal was to fire relatively soon.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.080]   So this was kind of going according to plan, if you will, just not the original plan that
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.680]   I had neatly mapped out.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.880]   So tell me this.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.560]   So just for a listener's perspective, can you give an idea of the total compensation
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.160]   range that your wife earns?
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.560]   I think one of the largest pieces, and again, this is a roundabout answer, one of the largest
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   pieces of compensation within big tech is coming from equity, particularly as you get
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   more senior.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.960]   And if you look at Uber's stock price over the past two years, it's ended up doing exceptionally
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.520]   well, like finally.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.480]   They IPO'd at $40, then it kind of floundered for the last couple of years.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.520]   But then this past year, they hit highs of $80, and now settling in like the $60 to $70
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   range.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.200]   So easily like getting into the mid six figures ranges, which is not, again, like, and both
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.960]   of us were in those similar bands.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.400]   And does every year a tech worker get new RSUs topped up every single year, or is it
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.920]   at every four years or whatever chunk?
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   That's a really good question.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.960]   I think that's where it's important to understand the compensation philosophies for every tech
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   company.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   Each one is very different.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.240]   Meta, for example, every year, you'll get a new annual stock refresher that vests over
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.680]   four years.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.120]   And that refresher is entirely formulaic.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:25.540]   And it's not based at all on how much equity you already have, versus Uber and Amazon and
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.480]   many other companies, they have what's called a target compensation model, where the amount
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.080]   of refreshers that you get kind of looks back at how much equity you already have, to kind
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.000]   of make sure that you're getting paid at least a certain amount of total compensation.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.120]   So with Uber stock price increasing significantly, that refreshers in many cases were less than
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.400]   they had been in the past, because they were really trying to keep people within these
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.520]   target bands.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.400]   So that's where it's like, it can be very different, like being at Meta, where the stock
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.360]   prices is all your past equity has also drastically increased, but you're still getting those
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:07.080]   refreshers at the same net dollar value, versus Uber, if the stock does well, then your future
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.760]   refreshers won't be as high.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   Okay.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.760]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   So one of the things that I try to tell readers is go try to make a lot of money to realize
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.360]   making a lot of money via W2 income is not the dream or amazing thing that you think
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.320]   it is, because it takes a lot of stress, a lot of work, just a lot of dedication.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.520]   And so I'm going to guess that your wife makes between 400 to $600,000, and you made something
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.760]   similar, given that's what you just said.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.520]   So now that you've gone from, let's say, 800,000 to 400,000, how does that feel?
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.880]   Because I feel that once you make like 400,000, I mean, life is good.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.600]   Once you make over like 250,000 combined household income, life is pretty good.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.320]   So to strive for way above that, I don't think is worth it after so many years.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.640]   I mean, definitely try it for as long as possible.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.220]   But afterwards, it's like, "Eh."
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:10.560]   So how does it feel now, your lifestyle and overall unit going from 800 to $400,000?
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.120]   Honestly, very little difference in our life at all.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.000]   We've changed nothing.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   We're actually now looking at renting a new place that's closer to my daughter's school
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.400]   where we can just walk to school, and looking at almost doubling the amount we're paying
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   in rent.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.480]   So we're increasing our expenses as we're kind of going in and cutting our overall salaries
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.760]   in half.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.280]   So I think, again, the amount that you make once you hit a certain point, it just becomes
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.600]   decoupled from your needs in many cases.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.960]   If you're, again, you can always spend as much as you want.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.000]   But I've kind of found we've kind of like capped out around, like right now, been pretty
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.340]   consistent around like $140,000 in spend per year, much of that being housing and childcare.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:07.060]   And then when my daughter left her private preschool and joined school, the amount that
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.320]   you save ends up just shifting to other places.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.140]   And we kind of generally stay within that $140,000 per year.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:20.460]   And one of my goals this year was to actively spend more, because I felt like we weren't
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:27.500]   spending enough on things like family vacations, wanting to invest more into being where we
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.340]   living in a place that we enjoy spending time in, because we do spend a lot of time at home,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.380]   and being able to do things like walk to school and just valuing those types of things over
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.380]   continuing to save.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:47.540]   Again, 15 years in tech, dual income, the amount that we need to save to hit our goals,
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.640]   it just becomes diminished, particularly in how the market has done over the past decade.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.100]   So let me ask you this, because I'm looking at a household as a unit, right?
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.100]   Not as an individual.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.060]   So I see one parent who's working, making good money, another parent who has way more
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.500]   freedom, who can do more childcare and pursue his entrepreneurial endeavors, for example.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:18.580]   To me, I see that as a healthier balance versus two parents grinding away in tech or consulting
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.760]   or finance.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   But that's just my opinion.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.820]   I'm just stepping back and saying, "Okay, both of you guys don't have to suffer.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.020]   If only one of you have to, quote, 'suffer by working' and the other has the freedom,
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.700]   that sounds better.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:39.020]   What are your thoughts on giving up this substantial amount of money, let's say, again, $400,000
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.420]   to $600,000 to be a stay-at-home parent?
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.780]   Do you think it's worth it?
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.100]   And if not, why not?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.340]   I'll actually flip a little bit of what you said.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:58.780]   I think being a primary caregiver and primary stay-at-home parent is way harder than working
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.980]   in big tech for me personally.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:06.580]   I found it definitely rewarding and I value the time that I'm spending with my daughter
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.020]   a lot, but it is way harder.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.340]   The time that you spend at work is a little bit more predictable.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.180]   You can control it a little bit more.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.780]   You can take breaks when you want to.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.060]   That's not the case when you're dealing with your child.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.500]   You don't get to dictate your breaks.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.340]   You're not in control of your time as much.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:33.340]   And that's something that I didn't fully appreciate until getting laid off and then taking on
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.980]   that primary caregiver responsibility and really kind of like leaning in a little bit
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.700]   more on, "Hey, I don't want to jump back into the W-2 grind.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.780]   I want to take some time off."
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.540]   And with that comes the expectation of taking on more of the household duties, childcare,
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.940]   and just the general household management pieces of it.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:02.300]   And from a pure, I don't know, yeah, I think that these more challenging than anticipated
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.580]   I think is the answer.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.580]   I totally feel you.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:12.020]   I wrote a post called something like, "Looking forward to going back to work as a vacation
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.740]   from being a stay-at-home father."
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.500]   And so is your daughter in school full-time now?
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.020]   She's in kindergarten at the end of the year.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.020]   Okay.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.500]   So this is something that I've been thinking about because my daughter is not in school
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   full-time.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.460]   She'll start full-time school September 2024.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.920]   And then I'll have two children who are in school full-time for 40 plus hours a week.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.540]   And I feel that there's going to be this void to fill.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.420]   And so I feel that the responsible thing as a parent is to actually do some work, some
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.820]   meaningful work that can generate some income and buffer our finances and pay for crazy
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.500]   college education and all that stuff.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:56.100]   How do you spend that time now that you don't have work and your daughter's in school for
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.740]   seven, eight hours a day?
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:07.100]   I actually think this is the best time to fire in terms of when your child is growing
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.540]   up.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:14.780]   Early childhood is the hardest thing ever, particularly zero to when you get to full-time
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.180]   school.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.340]   It's just extremely challenging.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.580]   But once you get to school, like you said, you have a good 40-hour chunk where they're
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.380]   at school and you have time to do things.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.780]   Yes, there's a significant amount of time with things like grocery shopping, laundry,
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.100]   and all of those other miscellaneous household activities.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.140]   But there is also still a lot more time.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.460]   And in terms of responsibility, honestly, because our finances are in a place where
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.160]   we're not needing my salary to hit our goals and live the life that we're wanting, it's
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.060]   been much more in terms of how do I want to spend my time in a way that's fulfilling and
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.340]   that I'm getting value?
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.660]   Because that's the one thing I didn't realize as much is how much purpose that you get from
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.660]   your nine-to-five job and just how much the built-in reputation that you have just from
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.940]   I work at Meta.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.460]   And when I'm talking to other parents, like, "What do you do?"
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.860]   Like, "Oh, I work at Meta."
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.100]   They just have an instant answer to things, an instant level of credibility.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.020]   And once that's removed, it's just a different dynamic.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.660]   And needing to figure that piece out a little bit more has been one that I didn't fully
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.640]   value.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.540]   So then now when I'm spending my time, I'm doing things like I write my newsletter, Fangfire,
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.360]   which is all around helping tech workers do exactly what I do, like position themselves
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.080]   where they have the optionality in their lives for being able to be financially independent
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.760]   and maybe retire early.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.080]   And that's one of the things that I found is like, "Hey, it's fulfilling."
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.960]   But honestly, I'm not spending as much time as I thought I would be doing those things.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.720]   I'm also spending time going within San Francisco, going onto the different piers around the
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.480]   city and going fishing, but there's only so much time you can really go and do those things.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:04.240]   So I think whether it's responsible or not, a lot of it has just been kind of trying to
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.880]   find purpose and like the meaning of life in the absence of forced work and just kind
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.400]   of like reflecting on a lot of the opportunities that I've had in my life that kind of like
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.660]   put me in this weird position.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.760]   So a lot of my view is around making sure that I'm not doing anything that's sacrificing
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   the potential for my daughter to be in that same potential position in her future.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   Because a lot of it is, there is like some level of guilt like, "Hey, maybe I should
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   be working.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.800]   Maybe I should be saving more money or being able to put her in, like throw more money
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.920]   at raising a child type things."
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.280]   Like you can spend as much as you want on summer camps and tutors and external activities
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   and all of those things.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.160]   But right now, I think we're in like a happy medium.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.640]   Yeah, it's interesting because I came up with this concept called the provider's clock.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   And it's kind of like the biological clock for men where I feel like men are hardwired
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.280]   to provide some more than others.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.320]   And so when I had my children, I felt, "Uh-oh, I better start saving and investing more."
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.000]   Even though I had all these calculations in place that said we would be okay.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.720]   And the same thing happened when our daughter was born in the end of 2019.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:25.000]   And so I feel that if my kids are going to go to school, well, they're going to an independent
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.640]   Mandarin Immersion School that costs a lot of money.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.800]   I feel my provider's clock is ticking louder.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.920]   I'm thinking, "God, I got to do something in terms of consulting or something to provide
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.280]   more income."
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.160]   Because I can't play pickleball or tennis all day, and I can't meditate all day or write
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.320]   all day, my fingers will fall off.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.280]   So I need to do something to generate that income.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.960]   So do you have...
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.120]   How much of that urge in you as a man, as a father, is there to try to go back to work
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.280]   and make money again, or a lot more money?
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:03.360]   I think there's less of a desire to make a lot of money again, just because there's not
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.840]   as much of a need.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:12.800]   Right now, I had opportunities immediately after leaving Meta to just jump right back
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   into tech, probably making 500K without too much trouble.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:24.520]   That is something that was a huge opportunity that I could have had multiple different places,
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.920]   whether it's both within Feng as well as within the startup world.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.400]   Obviously, the startup world, the compensation upfront isn't as high as within Feng.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.280]   But it just wasn't as appealing to me.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:42.560]   It was one where it wouldn't incrementally change my life or my family's life taking
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.280]   on that job again.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.280]   And I think I'm in a unique position in my life right now where I don't need to rush
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.520]   back in and take on a role like that again.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.360]   Even if it's like, I can decouple the earning money piece from the equation and really kind
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.120]   of think about, is this how I want to be spending my time?
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.680]   And then again, now I'm doing some of these newsletter things and financial coaching.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.000]   But if I was focused on finances and earning money, I'd be doing things much more in a
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   different way.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.920]   It would be much easier just to go back into tech by far than trying to do my own solo
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.120]   thing.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.840]   And really it's just around, I don't need to be focused on money and it kind of skews
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   and changes the way that you prioritize things.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:37.860]   So how important is having a wife who works in Feng who makes a lot of money impacting
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.860]   this decision?
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:44.720]   So in other words, if she lost her job, who is the one who is going to actually want to
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   go back to work?
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   Or how would you feel?
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.400]   Yeah, no, that's a good question.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.560]   I think if she lost her job, honestly, I think it would be mostly fine.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.840]   I think we've modeled things out where we can fire, but maybe not fire in San Francisco.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.720]   I think that's where there's some potential compromises.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.080]   We're getting close to fire territory, but fire in San Francisco, I think is in a different
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:12.760]   ballpark overall, just due to the cost of living and rent and housing overall.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.720]   And what did you say that number was in your newsletter that you think is the fire number
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.960]   in San Francisco?
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.400]   I think right now, the fire number for me and my household of spending 140K, but then
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.840]   also factoring in college and health insurance, I think it was getting around 5.6 million
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.000]   would be like, "Hey, we have health insurance paid for on the marketplace, ignoring subsidies,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.960]   and we're paying for four years of in-state tuition at Berkeley plus room and board."
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.280]   That 5.6 will get us there.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.840]   But that doesn't seem like buying a house.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.880]   It doesn't assume a lot of the types of things that we may want if we were to really be focused
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   on it even more.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.680]   But I think if we both lost our jobs and had to go back to work, I think we'd figure it
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   out together.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:08.120]   I think the biggest thing in terms of marriage, it's a partnership and needing to figure things
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   out.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:16.140]   I would have no problem if my family needed it, going back and getting a job.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.140]   That's the number one thing.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.560]   I always make sure that the things that I'm doing are not sacrificing for my family.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.180]   Because I think that's one of my central tenets is all around having my family have financial
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.020]   stability is really important because it's something like me growing up, I had extreme
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.260]   fluctuations in wealth that I personally is one of the things that really influenced my
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.980]   own fire path and my own desire to have my family not deal with that.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:47.500]   So I think if the stability piece was ever at risk, then I'd roll up my sleeves and jump
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.620]   back into tech, no problem.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.860]   Let me perhaps paint a scenario and give you some anxiety.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.220]   And let me know if there is anxiety if I ask you this question or paint a scenario.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.860]   So right now you rent in San Francisco and you send your daughter to public school.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:12.900]   What if I were to say, you know, your wife comes home and says, "It's actually my dream,
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:18.700]   Andre, to own a single family house with four bedrooms, three bathrooms in this neighborhood
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.340]   for 3.5 million dollars."
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.860]   And also, you know what, this public school, she doesn't seem to be really getting enriched
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.340]   as much as I'd like.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:35.940]   Her friends, she's not making friends that I want her to have or whatever it is.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.620]   And I would like to send her to a private K-8 school.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:47.120]   Let's say it's like San Francisco Day School or something and it costs $50,000 a year.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.100]   So in other words, your wife wants this and you're thinking to yourself, "Well, okay.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.300]   Well, one of the best things we can give our children is the best education possible.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.360]   Not money, but the best education possible."
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.340]   How would you think about that scenario?
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.820]   Because this is a scenario that many couples in FANG or in finance or in tech who make
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.500]   six figures a year think about.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.540]   They think about their houses and their children and also cars and all that.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.540]   How do you think about that?
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:24.220]   I think if I ever needed to sacrifice for my daughter's future, like I would never make
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.060]   that trade off and always want to make sure that she's set up for success.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:34.340]   So for me, what that involves is knowing that I'm going to need to be flexible with my decisions.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.600]   So right now, the reason we stayed in San Francisco was because we got into a public
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.540]   school in an area that we were happy with.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.420]   We're in a great Spanish immersion program that just happens to be down the street from
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.160]   us in a neighborhood that we were wanting to be closer to.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.720]   So I feel like I could see myself now through fifth grade within that place.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.060]   But the reality of public schools in San Francisco is that there's a lot of unknowns and the
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.600]   variability in schools is pretty high.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:10.400]   So I think as we're going into things like sixth grade and middle school, if it ends
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.640]   up being where we don't get into a school or the schools are underperforming or San
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.600]   Francisco unifies school districts, makes decisions that we don't fully agree with,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.880]   then I would wholesale be changing our decisions, whether that's private or leaving for another
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.840]   city in the peninsula or leaving the Bay Area.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.200]   Because again, my goal is all around just making sure that she's set up to be successful
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   and doing it in a way.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   It's interesting.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   That's my view there.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.840]   Because again, the other position could have been, I think, the direction that you're going
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.300]   in is I'll go back to work, I'll jump back into tech, I'll earn my big salary again and
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:26:00.640]   just pay the private school costs and pay for that $3.5 million house.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.480]   For some reason, I think for me, my default is I would love to be in an area where there's
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:13.640]   strong public schools and by nature of fire and not being tied down to the Bay Area, I
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:19.840]   would be able to shift gears and relocate and have that flexibility in mind to be able
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.360]   to do that without needing to increase expenses in the Bay Area.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.200]   Because it's already hard enough, as is in the Bay Area, adding in all these other costs,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.240]   it's one of those ones where you start asking the decision of like, why are we here?
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   Why not anywhere else?
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   I love the Bay Area.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.400]   That's the reason I've been here a decade.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.360]   Even though I planned on leaving every three years, I said I was leaving.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.800]   But then now, 10 years in, I'm not leaving anytime soon.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.720]   I feel that you've been here 10 years, you've been saying you're going to leave every three
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   years.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.600]   I think with an 85% probability, you're going to stay here until your daughter graduates
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.960]   high school.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.600]   And then the funny thing is, I mean, it's not funny, like getting into any UC school
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   nowadays, I mean, I went to Cal for business school, is like impossible.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:10.160]   And so, but the thing is, you could get into one of maybe like a second tier private school,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.040]   because you know, the acceptance rates are lower, and you can pay more money.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.100]   So I would also not bake in being able to get into UCLA, Berkeley, San Diego, nothing.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.240]   And you'd have to go the expensive private university route.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.680]   Have you modeled that into your future cash flow?
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   I haven't modeled in, I used UC Berkeley as just like one of the more expensive UCs, especially
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.480]   in terms of most of it's on the room and board side, and the private school, but nobody gets
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   into Berkeley anymore.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.520]   It's like, you can't you can't use that as the baseline, a school with a 5% acceptance
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.240]   rate as the baseline, but the baseline is just in terms of the expenses like every other
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.720]   like it's in line with other other UCs.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:56.200]   And I think like I went to a public university, my wife went to a public university.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.760]   And I think that clearly biases us like we both went to like, public schools in Texas
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.520]   growing up and then public universities in Texas.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:12.960]   And just seeing how like, yes, going to the the top tier universities has a clear advantage
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.920]   over everything else, but that doesn't entirely determine your outcome in life.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.560]   So I think for us, there has that has that like, inherent edge in terms of like, you
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.240]   know, like, you can like 95% of it is what you put into it.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:34.000]   And the other 5% is the opportunities that you're put into place to kind of take advantage
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   of.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Right.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.760]   Well, I'm really glad you said that you did have a job opportunity that paid you 500 grand
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.280]   and you basically said no, to do your own thing.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.960]   So that that's actually, you know, the proof, the test, really, when you're presented with
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.720]   the opportunity, and you actually turn it down, that can show that you are comfortable
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.000]   with your finances.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.800]   The other test of fire is when you don't have a working wife making big bucks.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.120]   I think many people would agree with that.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.440]   And that's the funny phenomenon in the fire community.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.620]   There are actually many male bloggers or podcasters who say they're financially independent and
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.880]   retired early, but then they have working wives making big bucks.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   They don't acknowledge them.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.280]   I listened to a podcast the entire episode and the guy was talking about how he was having
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:28.140]   a great life and he's being a dad, but no acknowledgment whatsoever of his partner.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.140]   Why do you think that is?
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.140]   Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.840]   I think there's a lot of like male ego that goes into place.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.440]   That's one thing I've thought about a lot where when I decided I didn't want to go back
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.300]   to work anymore, did I feel comfortable saying I was fired?
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.880]   And I thought there was a lot of like hubris in that, like I could never imagine a woman
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.160]   deciding to stop working and being the primary caregiver ever saying she was retired.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.640]   There's that built-in bias just around like, "Oh, she's stopping working to be a stay-at-home
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.120]   mom."
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.960]   And for a male in the fire community, I think it's just easier to say, "Oh, I'm retiring
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.640]   early even though my wife is working and she's the one that's paying all the bills."
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:19.280]   So I consider myself like semi-retired and there's like a heavy emphasis on semi and
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.240]   really just a primary caregiver who has a lot of flexibility with his time, particularly
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.120]   because my daughter is in school most of the day.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.080]   So I'm able to make decisions where the financial piece isn't there.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:39.680]   But I can only say that because I have a working wife and I've had a working partner throughout
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:45.760]   our entire adult lives and I wouldn't be where I was or where I am right now or in the position
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.920]   I am if that wasn't true.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:56.160]   So I owe a significant amount to that partnership because again, it's much harder doing it solo
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.400]   and if you have a partner, especially within tech where you're both earning high salaries,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.600]   like it's just much easier, particularly when much of that time was dual income without
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.680]   any kids living in a one bedroom within San Francisco, the savings racks up pretty quickly.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.520]   So then when you do have kids, then all of a sudden you can kind of like balance things
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   a little bit more.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:22.400]   But it's one where there's just so much like ego on the male side where it's just easy
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.280]   to say like, "Hey, I'm retired now even though my wife is still the one paying the bills."
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:33.040]   What about from your wife's point of view, do you think there could be any such thing
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.760]   as resentment from your wife that you have so much free time while she's working?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:44.520]   Because obviously work is not all raindrop and gummies all the day, there's like meetings
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.280]   and banging your head and trying to do this and it's the stress.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   How does she feel about it?
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.560]   Yeah, I think she's been very supportive.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.840]   I think that we did have a lot of conversations around what it looks like and our approach
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:01.880]   has kind of evolved over the past year that I've now kind of officially gone semi-retired.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.840]   Initially, I think I treated it and treated my responsibilities at house and in the household
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.680]   the same as if I was working.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.560]   I thought I was a 50/50 parent taking on half of the responsibilities.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.080]   I would always do pick up and drop off already.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.720]   I would always make dinners.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.040]   And I thought that was 50%.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.440]   I think the reality was that it wasn't even close to 50%.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.880]   I think in my mind, I thought I was an equal partner.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:36.620]   But having even more for childcare, for all household responsibilities and all those pieces,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.960]   but by now being in this position where like, "Oh, I'm the primary caregiver now," she made
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.720]   it clear to like, "Okay, if that's the case, then you also need to step up on the household
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.340]   pieces."
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.200]   And I think it took us a while to find the right balance and rhythm and it's one that
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.220]   we're continuously working on because it's new for us.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.740]   We've been together for 15 years, married for 12.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:04.320]   And we've always been in this shared responsibility dynamic where we're both working and we both
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.800]   have limited time to take care of everything else.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.340]   So it was kind of like in survival mode, if you will, on the other things.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.040]   But then now, the dynamic shifted.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.880]   I have time and there's not an excuse for the laundry to be piled up.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:25.440]   There's an excuse for the birthday parties not to be planned and the summer vacations
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.820]   and the camps.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.500]   And I just had no idea of how much time all these small little things take.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.280]   I had to infiltrate the mom groups on Facebook to figure out when summer camps are.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:42.140]   There's like a cabal of Bay Area mom groups where they have secret spreadsheets and war
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.520]   rooms around every single week of the summer when all the best summer camps are.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.560]   And it's impossible to find unless you're in these mom groups and they're open and willing
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:57.500]   to allow males in, but you have to physically search for the mom group pieces.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:04.500]   So I think it's one where the dynamic has changed and I've had to take on more responsibilities
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.900]   that I thought I was already doing, frankly.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.820]   I thought I was already doing a lot, but it was very clear that I wasn't.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.540]   And we, over time, got to a better place.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   Not there yet.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   My wife heard this.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.260]   She'd be like, "Hey, you still haven't done X, Y, and Z yet."
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.900]   But it's one where the working on, and I think the biggest thing is acknowledging it.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.740]   And there's a really good card game we played.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.020]   It's called Fair Play.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.880]   And it physically has cards of every single responsibility that you typically have in
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   a house.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.940]   And you deal the cards around who's going to take ownership over each of those things.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.200]   And we had done it while we were working.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.820]   And then once I stopped working, we had to redo it.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.220]   And now because I had so much more time, more of the cards fell in my lap.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:54.420]   I think that was the clear outcome from just having more time doing available to me.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.700]   Marriage is a work in progress.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.940]   And there's no such thing as 50/50.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.420]   So, if you're seeking for 50/50, I think you're going to be severely disappointed.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:09.860]   If you're the stronger person, it's actually up to you to lift the baggage into the upper
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.460]   container of the airplane.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.460]   It's not 50/50.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.140]   So, stop thinking 50/50, I think.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.300]   For those of you in partnerships and marriages.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:24.660]   As we conclude this episode, I'm curious to know what's next.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:30.020]   Because to me, there's a lot of FOMO in the San Francisco Bay Area and big cities like
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.140]   New York, Los Angeles, Seattle.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.340]   Here there's tech and AI FOMO.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.660]   And you came out of tech, right?
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.700]   So, at least you're still hedged with your wife in tech.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.180]   She's going to benefit with Uber stock doing well.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.860]   But now there's AI mania.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.260]   Do you feel that FOMO?
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.620]   Like the itch to get back at all into the field?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.580]   I think there's definitely some FOMO, particularly as I left, then Facebook stocks literally
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.460]   skyrocketed to all-time highs immediately afterwards.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:03.500]   But there's the FOMO of looking at those spreadsheets that I had around what my total compensation
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.680]   would be this year if I still had all the equity that I had.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.540]   But then I have to fight it and be like, "Hey, my life wouldn't be any different."
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.180]   I hit my goals and continuously ground myself and like, "Hey, what are my actual goals in
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.500]   life and what do I want to achieve and do I need to be working to do that?"
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   But I think the FOMO is there.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:28.140]   I think that's the reality of it, particularly now within the, "Are we heading into a new
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.060]   world with AI?
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:36.340]   Is the stock market going to continue to grow in the same rate that it has in the past?
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.600]   Should I be taking advantage of this golden opportunity and try getting into AI and leaning
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.820]   in and doing that?"
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:50.620]   I'm in San Francisco, I'm in the mecca of AI, am I making a mistake by sitting it out?
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.620]   And that's what I think about and I'm trying to stay close to all of those things.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:37:00.020]   I think that's one of the things where through my newsletter, it's all around helping big
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.380]   tech workers be successful financially.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.820]   So that forces me to kind of stay plugged in.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.940]   So I think as things kind of shift, I'm still plugged in on developments and still plugged
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:17.500]   in on the dynamics at each of the big tech companies.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.180]   And I think if, again, I can always go back to work.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.580]   I think particularly now, again, I'm one year out, so it's still fresh.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.740]   I think as it gets closer to being five years out, I think then when it starts getting harder.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.780]   I think two, three years out, actually.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.320]   I'm in that Goldilocks zone where the option of going back would be relatively easy.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.260]   I think it gets exponentially harder from there.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:45.500]   But as of right now, as of hitting that one year milestone, I'm still very content, again,
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.580]   with the hedge that my wife is still in tech and still benefiting from that.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:56.420]   One of the things I think about is, because I can't get a job in tech, I don't have any
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.740]   tech skills or nothing.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:03.480]   The way I've thought about it since coming to San Francisco in 2001 is to go long real
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.080]   estate because every single tech worker, AI, whatever, needs a place.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.040]   And by far, the number one thing that people with large financial windfalls do is they
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.960]   buy a home regardless if the math makes sense or not.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   And so what you've seen in the Bay Area and other international cities like New York City,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:28.240]   Hong Kong, Singapore, London, is that the math seldom makes sense from a cash flow perspective,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.880]   but it tends to make sense if you see capital appreciation.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.760]   So I know you're renting and you are very pro-renting and I think you have a frugal
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:44.520]   mindset to you, but if you plan to be here for 5, 10 years, which I think with 85% probability
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:51.020]   you will be here for actually 10 years, I would say rerun the numbers and get long real
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:58.860]   estate because that capital appreciation potential will way outweigh the savings you have from
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   renting.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.860]   So what are your thoughts on that?
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.860]   No, I've read a lot of the calculations.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.940]   I mean like have no problem renting and always run the numbers, but I think you bring up
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.100]   a good point.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.520]   Those numbers are only as good as the assumptions that you put into it.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:16.540]   And a lot of times you bake in fairly conservative appreciation numbers on the value of the houses.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:22.020]   And if the value of the house increases higher than like, say 3%, then all of a sudden buying
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.180]   becomes much more lucrative.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.660]   And it's always been one where like, hey, in that like 7 to 10 year timeframe, most
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.580]   of the time there's that break even point.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:35.100]   Right now it's pushing higher than that into like the 10 year plus, but again, all of that
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.560]   assumes that the capital appreciation is in that 3% range.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.180]   If it starts pushing into the 5% plus, which I think historically for a single family home
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:48.780]   in San Francisco, isn't unrealistic, then buying can start making a lot more sense.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:57.520]   For me, my biggest concern is making a large outsized mistake.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.720]   And it's a lot of like risk minimization.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.900]   And for me, only now I can be certain, like ish, that I'll be in San Francisco for five
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   years.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:13.980]   And I think other people are more certain than I am in my propensity of actually staying.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:19.620]   But before we got into the kindergarten, it was always like, maybe we leave before kindergarten.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.100]   Maybe we leave now before middle school.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.540]   Who knows whether we actually...
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.940]   If we don't leave, and we stay in a place long term, then I think buying can make sense.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.620]   I'm not inherently against buying.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:37.140]   And this year, one of the things I'm doing is spending significantly more on my rent.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.920]   And I think we're just about to lock down a two-year lease that's like much more expensive.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.540]   And it's for a single family home, again, walking distance to my daughter's school.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.220]   And I think that will be kind of like a litmus test in terms of like, "Hey, let's see how
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.660]   we like the single family home life in San Francisco."
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.660]   Yes, we're renting.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.380]   Yes, it's not the exact same thing as ownership.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.020]   Yes, we're not gonna take advantage of a lot of the flexibility and benefits that come
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.980]   from actually owning.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.580]   But I think it will be kind of like testing the waters in terms of, is that the life that
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.020]   we actually want?
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.380]   And do we want to have that longer term?
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.260]   And then it's around figuring out how to make it work.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.220]   So I have no problem renting.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:20.140]   But as soon as I'm convinced that I'll be somewhere for 10 years, or like, again, I
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.140]   will buy again.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.540]   Like I owned a house when I used to live in Austin before moving to San Francisco.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.260]   I have nothing against homeownership.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:32.100]   It's just the numbers have always been so challenging in San Francisco to make it a
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.100]   easy decision.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.900]   It's never been an easy decision in the Bay Area.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.060]   It's always one where the numbers get kind of fuzzy.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:44.420]   And the amount a mortgage costs versus rent costs in the short term.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.980]   If you don't assume appreciation, it's just hard to pencil it out.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.260]   With appreciation again, it changes.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:56.300]   But again, that's where I have always leaned on like, let me just rent and I'm disciplined
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.460]   enough to invest the difference.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.460]   I think that's the big thing.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.460]   Right.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.460]   Which is very important.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.180]   Which is the most important thing for all these calculators.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.300]   It assumes you're investing the difference.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.860]   And if that's not the case, then the forced savings of a mortgage might be more beneficial
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.180]   than most people realize.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.180]   All right.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.100]   Well, it sounds like you got a lot of things to think about.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.340]   Congrats on the new rental house.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.580]   And I'm looking forward to seeing what's next.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:28.100]   If listeners want to subscribe to your Fang Fire newsletter, how do they find you?
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.100]   It'll be in the show.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.860]   You can find me at FangFire.com.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.340]   That's F-A-N-G Fire dot com.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.060]   And that will redirect you over to my newsletter on Substack.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.940]   And that's where you'll find me writing probably like twice a month on all things tech and
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.940]   fire.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:45.940]   All right.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.940]   Twice a month.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.940]   That's pretty good.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.940]   It's a pretty lax.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.940]   What about once a week?
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   So that was one of the things.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.740]   I thought I was going to be writing a significant amount more.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.620]   But I really found that cadence there.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.300]   It's like, I feel good around twice a month and continuing that up.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:05.780]   I think once a week, it turned into the same kind of grind and dread that I had from working
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.820]   and it kind of changed the dynamic a little bit.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.220]   No, I hear you.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.340]   I got to think about that too.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.060]   I might go on a summer schedule and maybe publish twice a week with actually a newsletter
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.720]   instead of three times a week and a newsletter.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.580]   I don't want to feel that grind.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.580]   Too old.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.180]   It's just finding the right balance.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.180]   I think that's the big thing.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:33.020]   I would say for me that more than twice a month ended up just being work.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.180]   I probably should be doing more and be more consistent.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:43.140]   I think that's the one thing that if I really wanted to make this a business and a career,
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.220]   but I don't have that pressure to.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.620]   So I think that's one of the things that let me be a little bit more lax in terms of how
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.100]   often I write, how often I publish and how much time I put into it.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.100]   All right, Andre.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.100]   We'll chat again.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.100]   Great having you on.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.100]   It was a pleasure, Stan.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.100]   Thanks again.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.100]   Thanks.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.100]   Take care.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.100]   All right, everyone.
