[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   Today we have a basic but really important question we have yet to address on the podcast.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.600]   It comes from a listener named Matthew.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.840]   "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220]   I'm a relatively new believer who was saved through a very faithful Bible preaching ministry
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.640]   on my college campus.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.840]   I have since graduated and am now looking for a home church to become a member.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.320]   In every case, I have been asked if I have been baptized.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.440]   I have not been baptized.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.720]   I need to, and I plan to.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680]   But I was wondering if you could explain to a newer believer like me why do I need to
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.960]   be baptized?
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.600]   What does it mean, and why is this an essential step for me to take?"
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   Thank you, Matthew.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.280]   I love the question.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.320]   It's an honor to try to answer it.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.240]   Let me start by just reading a definition of what baptism is from our church affirmation
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.680]   of faith, and then I'll try to unpack it and explain it.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.120]   We believe that baptism is an ordinance—I'll come back to that word—we believe that baptism
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.360]   is an ordinance of the Lord by which those who have repented and come to faith express
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   their union with Christ in his death and resurrection by being immersed in water in the name of
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280]   the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.320]   It is a sign of belonging to the new people of God, the true Israel, and an emblem of
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:44.760]   burial and cleansing, signifying death to the old life of unbelief and purification
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.480]   from the pollution of sin.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.280]   Now that's a long definition.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280]   Sorry.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.240]   But it'll make more sense if we just take it one piece at a time.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.120]   First, we believe that baptism is an ordinance of the Lord.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   What we mean when we say that it's an ordinance is that the Lord Jesus commanded it.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.720]   He ordained it.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   The word "ordinance" comes from "he ordained it."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He planned it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   He said we should do it in a way that gives it an ongoing practice in the church.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.120]   And the part of the Bible where it says that is Matthew 28, 19 and 20, "Go therefore and
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.720]   make disciples," Jesus said, "of all nations, baptizing them."
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.520]   So Jesus told us to do this until he comes back, because he keeps going and says, "baptizing
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.220]   them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and lo, I am with you always
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820]   to the end of the age."
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.700]   So as long as this age exists before Jesus comes back again, we are to be making disciples
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.480]   for him by teaching what he's taught us and baptizing them in the process.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:08.100]   Second, baptism, we believe, expresses union with Christ in his death and resurrection.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.300]   And the clearest teaching on this is found in the book of Romans 6, verses 3 and 4, where
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   it says this, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ"—so
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:30.660]   you hear the idea of unity there—"baptized into Christ were baptized into his death?
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.720]   We were buried, therefore, with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.260]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life."
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.460]   Now in the wider context of Romans and the rest of the New Testament, I think it would
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:02.520]   be a mistake to say that water baptism, the actual going into water, is the means of our
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.460]   being united to Christ.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.380]   I think that would be a mistake to say that.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:16.700]   In Romans, it's faith in Jesus, faith, Holy Spirit-given ability to love and trust and
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.980]   treasure Christ.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:27.740]   It's faith that is the means by which we are united to Christ and justified by him.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:36.340]   But we show this faith, we signify this faith, we symbolize it with an act of baptism.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.700]   Faith unites us to Christ.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.660]   Baptism portrays the union with Christ.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.700]   An analogy would be saying something like this.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:57.180]   When you're standing before the pastor getting married and you say, "With this ring I thee
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.500]   wed," what do you mean when you say that?
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:09.420]   When we say that, we don't mean that the ring, putting on the ring, creates the marriage,
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.420]   makes us married.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.980]   No, no, no.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.100]   It shows the covenant.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.780]   It symbolizes the covenant.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.620]   But the covenant, the actual marriage moment and event and union was the covenant vows
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.200]   that we made to each other in marriage.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.020]   That would be a comparison of the vows being faith in Christ and the putting on the ring
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.260]   being baptism.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.260]   When we trust in Christ, his death counts as our death.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.660]   His resurrection counts as our resurrection.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.780]   And then in baptism, we dramatically portray what happened spiritually when we received
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.920]   Christ.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:04.140]   Our old self of unbelief and rebellion and idolatry died.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.860]   And our new identity, a person of faith and submission and treasuring Christ, came into
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.180]   being—all of that through faith.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.700]   And that's what we confess, and that's what we symbolize when we go down into the
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.500]   water as though we were being buried with Christ and come up out.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.420]   Which is the third point, namely, I'm a Baptist.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.060]   If you ask another kind of Christian, like a Presbyterian or some others, they wouldn't
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.340]   say this necessarily.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.380]   I believe that we should immerse people in water.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.140]   Baptism is an immersion as opposed to sprinkling water on the head.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.880]   Romans 6 is my reason for that, and there are others.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:03.160]   It describes the portrayal of death and burial and resurrection through going down into water
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.440]   as into a grave and then coming back up out.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   So we were buried, therefore, with him by baptism, Romans 6.3.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.380]   In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we might walk in newness of life.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.000]   But it's not only the imagery that points to immersion.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.520]   So does the word itself.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.040]   The word baptizo, baptize, in Greek means dip or immerse.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   It means that.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.880]   It doesn't mean sprinkle.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.960]   And most scholars agree that this is the way the early church did practice baptism, and
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.880]   sprinkling came in later, maybe because it was hard to find enough water or gather it
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.000]   in a place for it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   And there are other pointers to the fact that immersion was the way they did it.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.800]   For example, the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8, verse 38, when he became a Christian, while
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.120]   he was traveling back and talking with Philip, it says, "They went down into the water to
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.120]   be baptized."
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.460]   He said, "Here's water.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.160]   What keeps me from being baptized?"
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.240]   And it didn't say Philip went down and got a jug of water and poured it on his head.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.480]   It says, "They went down into the water."
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   Same thing in John 3, 23, where baptism is happening in Anon near Salem because there
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.480]   was plentiful water there.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.320]   So all of that to say the third point is baptism is an immersion in water.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.440]   Fourth, baptism means doing this immersing in the name of the Father and the Son and
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.800]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.520]   Matthew 28, 19, "Go make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.540]   Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.840]   This means that not just any immersing is baptism, like diving into a swimming pool
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.440]   is not baptism.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:09.360]   There is a holy appeal to God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit to be present
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:18.800]   in this act and make the portrayal true and real in what it says about the work of redemption.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.320]   There's no salvation without the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Trinity,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.660]   one God in three persons.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.760]   When we call upon their name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we're depending upon them,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.520]   all of them, and we're honoring them and we're saying that this act of baptism is
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.480]   by them and for them.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:50.840]   Fifth, baptism is an expression of faith and therefore only for believers, which is why
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.800]   we don't baptize infants who are not able to believe.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   And let me just give you one verse for why you should seriously consider the fact that
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.920]   it's only for believers and that it is an expression of faith.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.200]   When I was in Germany studying with nothing but Lutherans, all my classes, I was the only
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.960]   Baptist and studying at the University of Munich, and we went away on a retreat and
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.440]   talked about baptism, and they all turned to me and said, "So why don't you baptize
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   babies?"
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.600]   And I took them to Colossians 2.12, and I'll tell you what they said, but here's the
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   verse.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.640]   It says, "Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.920]   him through faith."
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.600]   Did you get that now?
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:47.440]   Burial and resurrection in baptism, the symbol of baptism there, the symbol of burial and
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.320]   resurrection in baptism is through faith in the powerful working of God who raised him
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.000]   from the dead.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And the professor, who's also a Lutheran, said, "Well, I think you're right in the
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.960]   way you interpret that verse, but the verse isn't addressing the issue of families; it's
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.120]   addressing the issue of evangelism."
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:16.680]   So I appreciated that much of concession, but my point was, I think there is a principle
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.720]   being mentioned here that covers all the cases.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.040]   That's what baptism is.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:30.000]   It is a demonstration of the burial and resurrection with Jesus which happened through faith, and
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.060]   so we should only do it to those who can believe.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.480]   So baptism is very important.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.920]   It was uncompromisingly commanded and ordained by the Lord Jesus until he comes.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.040]   It was universally practiced and administered by Christians in the early church and has
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.120]   been all through the centuries.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.520]   Paul took it for granted.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.760]   There are no unbaptized Christians in the New Testament, and it was uniquely connected
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.080]   to conversion as an unrepeatable expression of saving faith.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.560]   We're only justified once.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.940]   We only die and are united to Christ once and permanently.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.320]   And one last comment.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:21.240]   It was closely connected to being a member of a local church.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   In the mind of the apostles, to be united to Christ by faith through baptism was to
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:36.440]   be united to the body of Christ, and local churches are the manifestations of the universal
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.280]   body of Christ.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:44.120]   To be a Christian, therefore, is to belong to a local church.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.600]   It's right and fitting that you belong to a church.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:55.120]   Baptism wasn't a fun climax to beach evangelism with everybody going their separate ways with
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   no reference to the church.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.160]   Baptism was a sacred expression of faith, a faith that unites you to Christ and his
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   people, a particular people in a particular church where you can be nurtured and held
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.440]   accountable as the New Testament teaches.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   That's very helpful.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.600]   Pastor John and Matthew, thank you for the great and simple question.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.080]   A lot of times the most important questions on the podcast are really not all that complex
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.040]   at all, so we appreciate those questions into the inbox.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   And coming up on Wednesday, we return to look at the doctrine of God's providence, the
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.800]   theme of Pastor John's new book by that title, Providence.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.320]   The glorious truth that God governs over everything that he makes is gloriously true.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.120]   And when we see it and embrace it as true and glorious, this doctrine will make a deep
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:54.040]   and definite impact on how we live our lives, our attitudes, our outlook, our priorities,
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.240]   our affections, our actions.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.360]   Everything changes when we see and embrace the providence of God.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.280]   We'll look at implication number six in our series of 10 that's coming up on Wednesday.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.680]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.280]   Thanks for listening.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
