[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   It is kind of this funny paradox that for people like us who have always been attuned to our money,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.720]   really probably our financial lives are the easiest part of our entire lives because it's
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.680]   on autopilot, right? Like that's how I have my whole financial life set up. I kind of famously
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.880]   say I spend 10 minutes a month on my finances and that's maybe a little bit of an exaggeration.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.920]   It's probably ever so slightly more than that, but not that much more, right? And I mean,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.960]   you set everything on autopilot. For me, it's stress minimization. So that's how I kind of
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.560]   conceptualize my finance. So I'm not looking to optimize every penny. I'm looking to optimize for
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.440]   stress mitigation. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.320]   your life, money, and travel. I can't believe I'm saying this, but welcome to episode 100.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.440]   It seems so surreal that I've come this far, but it wouldn't be possible without your support.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.480]   So thank you so much. And for this week's episode, I wanted to try something different.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.800]   The idea came up when I was talking to my good friend, Brad Barrett, who hosts the Choose FI
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   podcast. And he was my guest for episode two on financial independence. We started having
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.760]   a conversation about all the things we've learned the past few months and how we're applying them
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.320]   to our lives. Things like focusing on what matters, optimizing towards net fulfillment,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.800]   and a lot more. So instead of having that whole conversation on our own in private,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   we paused and decided that we would do it with you. So without further ado, let's get into it.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:40.800]   Brad, I am so excited we're doing this. Yeah, Chris, this should be fun. We always have a lot
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.200]   of interesting conversations offline. So this should be a fun meandering little chat here.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.840]   Yeah, and I don't know if you knew this. So this is my episode 100, but I went back and looked,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.520]   and I know you weren't my episode one, but we actually recorded your episode two on All The
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.600]   Hacks. And we actually recorded that first. So my very first hit record on a podcast was with you.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   So I'm very excited and thankful for you doing that. And it's kind of fun to be
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200]   celebrating 100 with you. Oh, that's so cool.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.800]   Well, I am honored that I was the first guest and back for 100 here. Yeah, it's wild. I can't
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.480]   believe you've been doing it that long. 100 episodes. So you're doing essentially one a week.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.960]   I know a couple times you've had two a week. So we're coming up in what, almost 18 months
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.000]   to two years, somewhere in that vicinity? Yeah, it's been about 18 months. And I love
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.040]   how Brad is saying this because if you haven't listened to Choose If I, his show, Brad's probably
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.200]   done 600 episodes at this point. So I feel like I'm way, way, way behind. But yeah, I mean,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.640]   when I started, I wasn't sure if it was going to be 10 episodes and it just wasn't going to be a
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   good fit. So the idea that I've gone from side project to full-time job on podcasting, you know,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.840]   I'm lucky to do that. I'm so thankful for everyone listening that has enabled me to do that. And I'm
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.480]   just excited for the next 100. I hear you. And what's wild about
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.400]   podcasting is there's no downside essentially to trying it. And so yeah, we're coming up right on
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.800]   600. But when we started, it was just me and Jonathan sitting in a random office,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.640]   spare office in Jonathan's house in Richmond, Virginia, talking into two microphones, right?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.680]   And it costs us essentially nothing to start. And we figured what the hell, right? Like, why,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.720]   let's, let's experiment with this. And if it goes nowhere, no harm, no foul, in essence, right? Like
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.000]   nobody's ever going to hear it other than our parents. And if it goes somewhere, then who knows
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.120]   what kind of impact it could have. So I mean, that's, it's pretty wild. So I mean, certainly
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.280]   podcasting is something that I never would have guessed in a million years would transform my life.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.040]   I mean, I was a corporate accountant. I did corporate state tax returns, which is as horrible
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.640]   and mind numbing as, as you can imagine. And now I'm a financial independence podcaster with
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.200]   60 million downloads. I mean, it's, it's crazy. And then to see your life transformed so dramatically
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.240]   since the first time I met you, which I guess was through the Playing With Fire documentary, right?
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.160]   I went to the fire. I guess it's not technically a fire conference, but FinCon seems like it's
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.920]   pretty rooted in the financial independence movement for my startup. Because I was like,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.840]   "Oh, we're building software for financial planners and people who want to be better
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.000]   with finances. I should go to this conference." We met and it's been a great friendship. And really
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.360]   kind of like how I think this episode came to be was we were just talking about things in life and
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.680]   catching up. And we're like, "We should record this." Like people would probably want to hear
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   what we're thinking about how last year went, what we're planning to do next year, what's going on
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.400]   with the fire movement, kind of all the things, health and data breaches, everything. So I'm
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.880]   excited to just kind of jump in and kind of go through what we go through. And if this does well,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.840]   people like it, obviously reach out to Brad and I, let us know, and we can make it a regular thing.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.720]   I would love to do this a couple of times a year. That's for damn sure. So
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.000]   yeah, let's kick it off. So I mean, I guess the biggest thing in your world, I don't want to put
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   words in your mouth, but I mean, you're full-time now on this podcast and you left Wealthfront
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.000]   fairly recently, right? Talk me through because that's not an easy decision no matter where you
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.800]   are in life. And now obviously, you have a degree of financial security that a lot of people don't
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.680]   necessarily when they're making job transitions. But nevertheless, that's not an easy step.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.160]   And I'm curious, how you thought through it? I am always a fan of the side hustle to full-time
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.280]   hustle path. So I started the podcast as a thing on the side. I kind of experimented with
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   working with partners and then got it to a point where it was, I guess, big enough,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.320]   financially stable enough that it was worth the risk. Is it financially stable enough that I would
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   make as much money as if I had a corporate job right now? Probably not. But do I see a path there?
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.960]   And can I make it work? Yes. And so that was really all I needed. I still love Wealthfront,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.760]   the product. I still love the team. In fact, the one thing that is sad about being a full-time
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.120]   creator is it's kind of lonely. So you build... You don't have that kind of water cooler team
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.640]   experience that you do at a company. And so I do miss that. I still have a
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.880]   text thread with all the Wealthfront people that I was close with. And we're talking almost every
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.640]   day. But I felt like it was an opportunity that if a friend asked me if they should take on,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.200]   I was like, "Yes, you should." So I needed to do it myself. I need to kind of take my own advice.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.720]   So yeah. And you had a co-host for a long time. And now you're kind of running the show.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.040]   Yeah. It's hard to believe. Yeah. So Jonathan, I guess it was probably August of last year. So
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.560]   yeah, we're coming five months and change, I guess. Yeah. He came to me and said, "I think
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.520]   I'm going to step back from the podcast." And it was definitely a surprise. And to everybody out
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.000]   there who... Because I got a ton of emails. I'm like, "Oh, what's going on? Is everything okay?"
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.480]   Everything's great. Jonathan and I are still great friends. In fact, I just came from a workout with
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.360]   him at the gym. We're working out together four days a week now. And he's doing stuff behind the
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.520]   scenes for Truths of Eyes. So we're still business partners. Everything's great. He's going to come
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.200]   back on the show every now and again. But yeah, man, it's been interesting. And you and I have
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.240]   talked a ton of times. Talked shop, actually, which is funny. Though I've been a podcaster,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.560]   I basically just have always showed up and recorded and that was it. And Jonathan kind of
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.520]   took care of everything. So yeah, when you're saying running the show, it's been a big change
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:47.040]   for me, honestly. And I think what I've always been good at in terms of the podcast was sitting
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:54.960]   back and just listening critically and asking questions. And frankly, for me and my skillset,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.680]   that was pretty easy. It wasn't a heavy lift. I just listened and asked a couple of questions
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.040]   here and there. Hopefully incisive, interesting questions. But damn, now I've got to do Jonathan's
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.000]   part and mine, which is Jonathan was always, hey, he was the engine behind the show, right?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.080]   And the reason why I'm going into this and I'm curious of your process is it is not just 2x the
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.280]   work for me. Now, being the engine behind the show, the story arc, and then the questions,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.840]   there's some exponential factor, especially with my brain. When I get done with this,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.000]   I'm fried, man. I mean, normally like on an interview, because you have to essentially
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.280]   bifurcate your brain of, okay, this side has to think about the story arc and moving it forward
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.840]   and making it interesting and logical and coming to a conclusion. But then the other side has to
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.280]   think of questions that are interesting and, oh, what would I want to ask if I were the podcast
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.120]   listener? Because that's how I think of myself. And man, it is, like I said, it's exponentially
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.480]   more difficult. But I mean, so far, I think it's going pretty well. I've been pretty happy with...
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.800]   It's been 20 plus episodes now. And yeah, it's so far so good. It's been a challenge. I'm not
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.480]   going to lie. It's been a challenge, but it's been good. Yeah, I think people that are listening
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.600]   think, "Oh, yeah, podcasting. It's so great. You just hop on, have a conversation." But there's a
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.040]   lot of work behind the scenes. I spend a lot of time just trying to plan out what is the topics.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.480]   And somebody emailed me and said, "Hey, it'd be great if you could work with more sponsors. I've
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.000]   never heard of. And you could interview people that have never been on other shows." And it's
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.960]   like, "Yes." But finding those people, finding those companies to work with, there's just so
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.360]   much... It's definitely a full-time job. I didn't want to start another startup because I didn't
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.760]   want to have another 80-hour-a-week job. And my wife and I joke together. It's like, "Oh, well,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.320]   you did start a startup. You just didn't call it a startup." So it's definitely demanding.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.360]   But it's great. You get a lot of flexibility. And people listening probably know that I've
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.440]   been experimenting a lot with, "Okay, well, what if I just do some solo episodes? What if I
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.920]   talk about a country? What if I just do something different and don't necessarily
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.720]   stick to only the interview regime?" So I'll push back. I mean, this is an example of that.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.840]   We're trying to... It's kind of an interview, but it's really more of a conversation. So
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.600]   I've been fun. That's been fun. And then I've been trying to make sure that it's not my only thing.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.440]   Right? We could talk about podcasting forever. But the average person listening here is probably
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.600]   like, "I don't have a podcast. I appreciate the background because it's interesting." But
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:35.440]   I think we are able to use the topic of the people we talk to and the content we consume as research
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.840]   for the show as ways to think about other things in life. And so that's also been really a fun part
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.440]   of it, which is you do an episode with someone talking about health, and now you got to go deep
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.200]   on your own health. And now that's a big project. And I know that's one of the things we're both
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.440]   really thinking about this year. So I don't know. I thought maybe for this episode, it'd be fun to
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   talk about some of the major things that have happened in the last month or two that have
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.920]   sparked missions or goals for what we want to do this coming year and talk about it openly.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.680]   And hopefully, people find that interesting because I know that when I hear you talk about
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.520]   your side, I'm like, "Yes, please tell me." Taking notes, all that kind of good stuff.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   Yeah, certainly. Right back at you. And you know, I told you offline that a couple of your episodes,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.600]   your most recent episodes have really, really significantly impacted me. And I mean, no joke,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.360]   I have listened to the Bill Perkins episode. I think it came out in December, mid-December.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.560]   And Dan Martell with Buy Back Your Time, listened to each of those twice already.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.880]   And sometimes it's fascinating. I consume a lot of podcasts, probably more than I should, frankly.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:53.120]   But you never know when an idea is just going to hit you. And I think if I'm honest with myself,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.200]   the Bill Perkins die with zero concept would not have resonated with me
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.920]   two years ago, certainly five years ago, it would have fallen on deaf ears completely.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.320]   And now when I heard him on, I read his book and really, really good book, certainly,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.840]   but it didn't impact me as much as hearing him on your podcast. And then I heard him on Peter
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.360]   Tia's The Drive. And I think just the confluence of a couple of things. So like that, and like I
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:30.240]   said, the Dan Martell, Buying Back Your Time. And I had my buddy Dominic Cortuccio on our podcast,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.400]   on Choose a Buy, episode 419, just a couple of weeks ago. And he was talking about your bold
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:44.000]   move for 2023. So his kind of conceptual framework is he comes up with like one bold move that kind
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.920]   of typifies that year. And he's been doing this now for, I think this is the ninth or 10th year.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:58.160]   And it just sounded really cool to, A, have like an operating principle behind a year,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:05.280]   but also to be able to then look back on a decade of growth and fun and experience and say,
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   oh, I was in that place when I did this bold move. And, you know, again, like I said,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.720]   the confluence of those three things have just like, I mean, without sounding hyperbolic,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:23.520]   like just kind of like fried my brain in the best possible way. Like, and I think for a while, and
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   I'm probably a little like neurotic and get inside my head. I have like, you know, prone to anxiety
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:37.280]   and such. And like, it was actually a little stressful, Chris. And I think when I spoke with
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:47.040]   Dominic, I just didn't have an answer. And then in hearing Perkins and Martel, like, I think it
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:54.080]   crystallized to me that I just need, I need to explore more. Like I need more fun in my life.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:02.800]   I am like, just trying, I guess, like what I actually hit on was my healthiest year ever.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.360]   Like, that's my kind of operating principle for 2023. And like, I think what that means in
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.400]   practical terms is actually like kind of loosening the purse strings and not being like, I don't
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.280]   consider myself like a frugal or cheap person anymore. Not that frugal and cheap are exactly
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:26.320]   synonymous. But, you know, I mean, obviously, you know, very well, the old school FI mindset
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.920]   of watching every penny. And I think, I think both of us, frankly, have gotten a lot better
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.240]   with that. So I'll let you jump in now, because I know, I know this, like that last thing is,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.320]   is like very impactful for you and how your mindset has changed just since I've met you,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.040]   honestly. Yeah, it's funny. When I first found the financial independence movement, I was like,
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   "Oh, this is great. This is how I've been living my life," which is like save every dollar possible,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.440]   find every hack there is to spend less on everything you want to do, whether it's house
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.200]   hacking or travel hacking or anything, so that I could save as much as possible.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.400]   Now, my original goal was to do that because I hadn't found a career that I loved. And I was
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:13.120]   like, "I can't work a job I don't love." So there was a real reason behind it. But I feel like I
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.720]   went to an extreme that was very hard to get out of once I realized, "Oh, I actually do like what
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.440]   I do." And now it was very hard to do the most silly things like, "Oh, I'm at a restaurant and I
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.160]   really want a miso soup." But miso soup is usually $3, and this place it's $6. And I'm like, "That
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.120]   just seems egregious. I shouldn't get this miso." It's like, "All I want is a miso soup." And we're
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.920]   talking about $3. And I would get stressed out about it to the point that I wouldn't get the
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.000]   miso soup. And my wife had ended up acting similarly. So we'd both be sitting there like,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.120]   "All we want is a miso soup, but for $6 between the two of us, we can't do it."
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   But we could if it was $3. It got to be a little crazy. And I hadn't been able to articulate and
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.560]   process those feelings. It's like something I'd been thinking about. And every one of my friends
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.960]   is always like, "Dude..." I remember going to dinners where someone's like, "We'll buy a really
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.120]   expensive bottle of wine if you just put in $20." And I'm like, "Why would I put in $20? I'm only
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.400]   getting a glass and there's a glass on the menu for $12." And they're like, "Come on, just spend
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.720]   $8." Everyone's just trying to get me to spend a little bit more. And when I sat down with Bill
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:28.240]   Perkins and we talked, I was like, "What is all of this money for?" That was one big component.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.880]   And then the other big component that I think I probably haven't talked a lot about is that
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:41.200]   sometimes, spending your money is not a net negative. So for me, when I think about the
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.000]   podcast, I'm like, "Oh, okay." I've never been in a circumstance where the business you work at or
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.400]   run, the expenses you create for it directly affect your income. When you work at a company,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.800]   if you spend a little bit more of the company's money, yes, there's an indirect trickle-down
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.120]   effect of the company being less profitable and might affect you. But when you're owning your
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   own business, if you spend all of the money the business makes, you don't have a salary.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   It's very different. And so as I think about the year ahead, there are opportunities to build
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.240]   cool products that everyone listening right now might benefit from, to save money on travel,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.120]   to get cool deals. I have all these ideas. But to go spend the time and energy to do that,
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.320]   I either need to hire people or invest more time or get an assistant or something.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:32.400]   And I struggle with that, even though I know that it's a good investment. I'm gonna invest
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.360]   money in my own business. So I'm trying to get better at it. And I don't have a bold move for
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:46.320]   the year. But if I did, it would be value my time or invest in myself. Maybe it's invest in myself.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.840]   But I don't know. I feel like that might be too broad because you'd be like, "Well, is it your
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.520]   health? Is it your time?" And then you could just... It's hard. And I think if there's anything I
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.800]   learned from running companies, you can't have a bunch of goals. You need a single theme that
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.240]   everything falls under. Otherwise, you just have this endless to-do list and you don't know how
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:08.720]   to prioritize. Yeah, I hear you. And like you said, "Oh, I could build out this thing to help
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.360]   people with travel rewards." And it may be a good investment. But I think one of the operating
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.800]   principles that I operate under is actually this question that I ask myself is, "What are you
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.080]   optimizing for?" And I think it's just really impactful just to ask yourself that. And I
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.960]   literally ask myself that quite often. "What in this situation are you optimizing for?"
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.560]   And I mean, from my daughter and what high school she's going to go to is, "Okay,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.120]   what are you optimizing for?" Are you optimizing for signaling of, "Look how smart my kid is."
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.240]   Are you looking for, "Hey, this is a nice neighborhood school where she could be on
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.040]   the marching band and we don't have to drive her halfway across the county." What are you
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.240]   actually optimizing for? Are you optimizing for elite college entrance? Do you care at all?
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.160]   So that's something that's been rolling around in my head. And the question to ask yourself is,
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.320]   really, what are you optimizing for? What would growth mean to you? In your case, is it,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   and I'm not necessarily looking for an answer, it's mostly rhetorical, but is it money? Is it
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.720]   impact? Is it building something new the world hasn't seen that only Chris Hutchens and his
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.760]   inimitable style with hacks can put together? Is it some alchemy of all three of those things or
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.960]   something that I didn't listen? I think it's really important to ask that from the outset,
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.240]   because you might get down a road where, "Hey, this is a good investment. This is going to have
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:44.720]   impact. But damn, if it isn't going to take up 40 hours a week out of my 168, is that worth it?"
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:51.920]   And I like to sleep. So 168 just isn't a real number in my mind. But no, it's a really valuable
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:59.120]   exercise. And I had Sahil Bloom on the podcast, by the time this comes out, maybe a week or two ago.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.400]   And no, a week ago. And we just talked about doing that personal annual review and going back and
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.760]   thinking through what is the... He has like, "Here are seven questions to ask yourself to reflect on
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.440]   the year past," which I think is just a really valuable exercise to try to figure out not
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:22.720]   necessarily just to reflect, but things like what created energy last year or what drained energy?
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.360]   How do you do less of that thing and do more of something else? And so, I don't know. If that's
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.520]   not something that anyone listening has done, I would encourage it because it's really helpful
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.240]   before you start planning for this year to figure out what worked well, what didn't work well,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.040]   and what can you optimize for based on how last year went. And then you can start to focus on,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.760]   "What do I want to focus on now?" And I think it's funny because you and I both kind of cut
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.680]   our teeth in the financial independence world. And I think most people think that we spend all
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.920]   of our time optimizing our money, when I think in reality, that is one of the few things...
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.680]   In terms of our investments and our savings and our bank accounts,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.200]   it's like one of the few things we spend almost no time on. It's like this funny paradox of the
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.880]   people who care about their money the most and talk about it the most actually spend the least
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.640]   amount of time thinking about it and use it more as a tool. So it was funny. I don't know if you
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.200]   saw... I know you did because you sent it to me. Sam Parr posted this thing on Twitter where he's
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.440]   like, "Would you rather earn 8% guaranteed forever?" And we'll both link to this in the show
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:34.160]   notes. "But at the expense of you can never invest in startups. You can never buy stocks."
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   And so many people were like, "No, I wouldn't." And it's like, "What?" So many people just really
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.640]   get caught up in that eking for return. So I don't know what your reaction was to that. But
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.200]   for me, it's like, "This year, I'm not trying to turn the dials on my investments. I'm trying
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.320]   to focus on my life." Yeah, focus on life is the critical part. And yeah, like you said,
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.000]   it is this funny paradox that for people like us who have always been attuned to our money,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.600]   really probably our financial lives are the easiest part of our entire lives
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.320]   because it's on autopilot. That's how I have my whole financial life set up. I famously say I
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.200]   spend 10 minutes a month on my finances. And that's maybe a little bit of an exaggeration.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:27.040]   It's probably ever so slightly more than that, but not that much more. And you set everything
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.000]   on autopay, autopilot. For me, it's stress minimization. So that's how I conceptualize
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.200]   my finance. So I'm not looking to optimize every penny. I'm looking to optimize for stress
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.960]   mitigation. So what that means in practice is I'll keep a little bit extra money sitting in
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.000]   my checking account, 5 or 10 grand, whatever it is. It doesn't even matter. And then I don't have
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.240]   to worry about timing. Like, "Oh, I have a big credit card bill this month." Who cares? There's
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:02.400]   a big buffer there. So I never want to have to think about the timing of anything. So all of my
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:10.720]   transfers happen pretty much on autopilot, except for a couple of random, HSA, I max out on January
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:16.160]   1st of every year, but I have a little task in Todoist, which is my task manager, and it's just
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:21.840]   max out HSA. And then I never have to think about it again. But anyway, so wanted to touch on that
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.800]   for sure. But yeah, this thread from Sam was so interesting, and it's especially fascinating.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.560]   So Sam Parr is one of the co-hosts of the My First Million podcast, which both you and I
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:41.520]   thoroughly enjoy. And interestingly enough, Sean Puri is his co-host. And he basically said,
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.480]   "I asked Sean and a few others this question. I'm shocked at how many said, 'No, they'd prefer to
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.680]   buy individual stocks and other things in hopes of a return greater than 8%. They want to manage
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:58.240]   their own money. This baffles me.'" And I actually wrote back to this, which Sean wrote back to,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.840]   and I don't think was altogether thrilled, but I said, "Baffling and just silly. Sean is a poker
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:10.320]   player, so he knows better. The highest likelihood of success over an investing lifetime is to match
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.920]   the market with low fees. Everybody thinks they're Warren Buffett. They're not. Match the market and
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:23.840]   get rich. Find your fun in real life." And I think that last part was especially the point
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.160]   that I wanted to make, is for most people, a lot of these people on this thread were basically
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.320]   saying like, "Oh, but I learn so much. I get fun out of this." I mean, my argument is there's so
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:42.880]   many other ways to actually have fun in life. And Sam's actual original post said, "You can still
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:49.200]   build your own startups. It's just, you can't invest in this wacky stuff." And I think for me,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   I look at life through the lens of a poker player and what increases my odds of success long-term.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.840]   So it's like the aggregation of marginal gains, right? 1% differences might not make a difference
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.440]   in the short term, but over a lifetime, if you make the right decision over and over and over
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.320]   again, thousands of times, it's going to have an effect. It's going to have a positive expected
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.680]   value, right? Plain and simple. And I think if you put a gun to someone's head and say,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.960]   "Are you going to outperform the market net of fees and net of taxes essentially from all your
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:32.000]   wacky trading over a 50-year time period?" No. I mean, virtually nobody is going to outperform.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.160]   So you're willingly taking a lower net worth for no reason whatsoever other than to have fun
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.600]   and to just be an idiot, essentially. And it makes no sense to me. It's totally illogical.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:50.480]   And I don't care how much money you have. You can tell this gets me hot and bothered. It makes no
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:58.400]   sense whatsoever. Go out and have fun in a million other ways. But to me, money, it's about maximizing
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.440]   net worth, especially if you can do it the brain dead way by investing in index funds, right?
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.240]   Like if the easiest way possible to maximize your net worth is the no-brainer way, man,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.760]   that's a win-win in every possible way. Why would you not pick that?
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:20.000]   I'll play a slight devil's advocate, which is, "I'm not sure picking stocks is the alternative
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.440]   that I'll put in this camp." But I do think... And the question kind of carved out the ability
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.400]   to start your own companies. But I do think that I've seen lots of people in my peer group,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.480]   my friend said, who've taken their money and built companies and taken their money and launched
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   products that have generated returns that exceed what an index fund or a set of stocks would do.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.680]   So that's true. I do think there is some uncontrollable instinct that, "I love this
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.880]   thing. I want to bet on it. I want to bet on it." It's like betting on yourself because you have
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.440]   this belief in the world. And I like to do that with a small part of my portfolio, but it's so
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:03.920]   small that it doesn't matter. And I would give it up if I had to. The big thing I'll say is all of
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.680]   the investing advice. If you asked this question 3 years ago, before the pandemic, and you said,
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.840]   "Stocks and bonds, how correlated are they?" It's like, historically, they're always not
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.160]   correlated. The 60/40 portfolio is always going to do great. That's why you diversify.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.200]   And then it didn't. And so I will say that as much as I don't believe what I'm about to say
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.600]   is something that you should factor in, I'll at least share it. All of the knowledge we have about
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.000]   how much better index funds are than stocks, it's all based on what happened in the past.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.520]   And there are all kinds of things happening that could mean a different future.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.720]   That said, I don't think any of the people I know that are choosing to make all these active trades
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.120]   and active investments are doing it for that reason. I think they're doing it for a different
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   reason. But there is some world where it could be something interesting. Or there's a world where...
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.960]   I did this episode with Brian Feraldi, who has a whole checklist on how to be an investor and
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.160]   invest in stocks. And he approaches stock investing much differently than most. Building
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   out a portfolio of stocks, almost like creating your own indexes and doing some research and
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   that kind of stuff. And I would say, if that's your approach, then I feel a lot better.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.040]   But if your approach is more, "I just picked crazy things because I want to win and I read
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.200]   about them on Reddit," I'm less excited. But we could go down that rabbit hole forever.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.720]   I think both of us, almost all of our money is in some form of investment account. I am curious,
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.400]   I think you manage yours on your own. So you're doing the rebalancing,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.760]   you're doing the tax loss harvesting. I think, not because I did work at Wealthfront,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.800]   but just because I believe that it is a better use of my time to not do that,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.560]   and to get the extra edge from things like direct indexing and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.000]   Have you ever considered not managing it yourself?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.200]   Yeah, that's a good question. Well, actually, under your advisement, I did open a Wealthfront
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.360]   account. I don't know if you ever actually even knew that I did that or not, but I have been
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.640]   putting some money in there. So just more to see how the tax loss harvesting worked, essentially.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:10.000]   And it's pretty cool, I'm not going to lie. And there is no world where I would do that
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.040]   on my own. So I mean, I haven't done analysis, certainly, of is the benefit that I'm getting,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.760]   does it outweigh the fees? I suspect that it does. But in all candor, I haven't. I mean,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:31.840]   sure, you have that information committed to memory in general. But yeah, I think for me,
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:39.520]   if I were to not manage my money, I think it would be more psychological than anything of like,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:47.200]   I like to believe that I don't make poor decisions, like sell when the world is
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:54.400]   going to hell in a handbasket in March of 2020, etc, etc. But I think I'm as susceptible to that
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.840]   as anyone. So I probably have underperformed what I should have performed if I just
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:07.280]   did what I advise all the time and just keep pumping money and go to sleep, wake up in 10,
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.240]   20, 30 years, and essentially have more money than I can imagine. Obviously, nobody cried for me,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.560]   I'm doing fine. I've reached financial independence. It's not at the end of the day,
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.920]   it's fine. But I know in my heart of hearts, I probably made suboptimal decisions based on
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.200]   emotion. And I think, you know, when we talked about, hey, like, the actual nuts and bolts of
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:34.240]   money is the easy part. I stand with that. And I hold to that, certainly. But because I think
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.760]   it's precisely the psychological part, that's the really the hard part. And you let your brain get
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.720]   involved. And it just kind of does stupid crap. I've always noticed that the financial independence
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.760]   community, and myself included, always hate fees. Like it just is one of those things that people
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.600]   just hate paying fees. And so I know that that's been a lot of the aversion to, you know, an
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.040]   investment advisor, a financial advisor, a robo advisor, any of those things. And what really
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.480]   changed it for me one time was, I had created this portfolio that was like eight index funds.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.120]   And I was going through trying the process of rebalancing and managing it and all that.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.800]   And I remember at one point, I was like, what trades do I have to make? I have to sell these
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.720]   three to rebalance. And it was just like, I actually wasn't sure if I could make the trades.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.240]   And then I was like, well, I don't know if these trades are gonna have to clear before I can rebuy.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.720]   And so I just kept pausing, pausing, pausing. And I watched the market move. And I was like,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.200]   what am I doing? I don't think that doing this full time is a priority enough that I'm doing it.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.800]   I have to do it. I have to offload it. The added benefit was that things like direct indexing,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.400]   when you can start to break apart the index fund and actually say, "Well, instead of investing in
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.440]   the S&P 500 or Vanguard at VTI or VTSAX, you just buy all the individual things."
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.560]   Well, obviously, that's completely untenable for a person to do and go buy hundreds and hundreds
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.880]   of stocks. But there are some advantages there when it comes to being able to tax loss harvest
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:58.960]   with 100, or 1000, or 500, whatever number of stocks. So we could go down here quite a bit.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:04.800]   I will attempt to pull back and stay on the money theme and just think, "Okay, so we're talking
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:11.040]   about money. We've identified not focus on that side of money, but what are we focused on? And
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.680]   how do we spend it?" Are there things that you think next year, you're going to spend more time
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.360]   thinking on when it comes to money, or how you spend it? Yeah, without a doubt. And like I said,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:30.880]   your podcast has helped inform a lot of this. And I think for me, it's experiences and health.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:37.040]   So those are the two things that at this point, I am prioritizing. And I think what that's going
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:44.080]   to mean in reality is spending money. And that's perfectly okay. And I think Brad circa five years
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.960]   ago would not have been okay with that. And I am now. And I think that's perfectly fine. And I'm
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.640]   frankly, very happy about it. So I'm curious if there's things that you're like this year,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.680]   this is what I want to spend on. So you and I are both
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:05.840]   lovers of Japan. And I desperately want to get back to Japan. And I want to climb Mount Fuji.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:12.240]   That is like an absolute goal of mine. Will that happen in 2023? I don't know.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:19.920]   Sophomore year of college over the summer, lived with a host family in a city called Hamamatsu.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:27.360]   And it was a couple hours south of Tokyo and the Shinkansen. And like, the only time that I saw
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.400]   Mount Fuji was on the bullet train. And it just like appeared. And obviously, you know how majestic
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:40.800]   it is. And then it was like, it was the cloudy season. And unfortunately, I only got like a
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.840]   couple little quick glimpses of it. I'm like, damn, I will be back there someday. And I mean,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:52.240]   at this point, it's going on 20, 20 plus years. So I have not been so great with the follow through
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:59.440]   on that. But my daughter, so my older daughter is now a roller coaster enthusiast, which is
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.880]   actually a thing like that is an actual term roller coaster enthusiast. There's like, like
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.760]   little, well, not little, there are like massive organizations of these roller coaster enthusiasts
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:18.240]   throughout the world. And in the town, immediately adjacent to Mount Fuji is one of Japan's best
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.560]   roller coasters. So I'm using this as like my little, my little hook to get my family there.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.720]   So because, and I don't know about you, and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts, like,
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:34.160]   you now have two kids. And I have two, I guess my kids are older at this point, which is kind of
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:40.880]   crazy to say, but it's still hard to travel. And we have not been as good at that as, as I wish
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:47.520]   that we were, frankly. So the very long, the very short answer to your question is, yeah, I just,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.080]   I need to get back to Japan. I want to show my family, my wife, just that amazing culture. And
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.280]   yeah, that's, that's the plan. So that's, that's the hope on like one of the big adventures.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.880]   Okay. So if you're listening to this and you haven't been to Japan, you absolutely have to.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.960]   Next week, I have an episode that's entirely devoted to Japan. I sat down with Brandon
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.400]   Presser, who is a previous guest, who I think said has been to Japan every year for the last
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:20.320]   20 years, except one. He's written, I don't know, five or six guidebooks on Japan. And we sat down,
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:25.040]   the episode is going to be long. We might even split it into two next week, because we were
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.600]   talking for a couple hours. But it is like, the goal was to be a masterclass in planning a trip
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.640]   to Japan. Overview of the culture, the people, the travel, the transit, Tokyo, Kyoto, other places to
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.400]   go, some hotspots that he loves, some unknown little corner places. So if Japan is anything
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.440]   you've ever even considered, you should listen. And I'm going to try to fit into this incredibly
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.280]   long episode at the end, a little thing about like, how do you use your points and miles to
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.880]   get there? Because that's like, that's what I love. How do you make it? How do you make it an
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.520]   affordable trip? Because Japan is known for being expensive, but so is San Francisco and New York
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.680]   and LA. And somehow we all make it easy. We all find ways to get to those cities. So
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.920]   yes, Japan should be on everyone's list. I've been four times and it's still on my list.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.880]   But I'm going to come back to your travel with kids thing. And it's something I've been really
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.160]   thinking about. And I actually had a really funny conversation this week with Tony Hawk,
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:24.720]   funny enough to bring it all together about travel to Japan. And when he was young in his early 20s,
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.080]   he had a kid and he for all we know that Tony Hawk being successful and famous and rich and
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.880]   all these things. At that point in time of his life, he was anything but that like living on ramen,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:41.040]   everything. And he got these demo offers in Japan and he couldn't afford child care. So he brought
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.200]   his kids to Japan when he was young or kid. And he would be like at a skate demo with a infant or
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.480]   toddler just like hanging out there because he just had to do it. He didn't have any options.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:58.720]   But his advice was by doing that and being forced to do that, his kids just got so comfortable
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.800]   rolling with the punches. And so we took what I think was a very ambitious trip to Paris and
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.600]   London with a six-month-old and a two-year-old. And it was nothing like a trip to London that
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:17.520]   you would take with no kids. But we learned how to make it work. Was it as fun as it was before?
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:23.200]   In many ways, no. But in a few ways, yes. You're showing your kids... And maybe you could argue it
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.760]   too in six months, they're not quite old enough to necessarily appreciate the culture. But they
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.840]   are learning how to sit on an airplane for 10 hours. They are learning... My daughter loves
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:39.120]   airplanes. So I think that we invest in a lot of things that are painful. If you want to learn how
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.400]   to run, the first getting out the gate and starting to run as an adult is painful. And then it gets
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.800]   easier and it gets easier. I think the same thing is true with travel with kids. And sure, I'm going
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.360]   to do an episode in 2023 about all the travel hacks I've learned traveling with kids from the
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.960]   Stokke JetKids suitcase, which if you have a small kid, is amazing. And it basically converts any
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.560]   coach seat into a business class seat, at least in the eyes of a young kid. Does nothing for adults,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:11.280]   by the way. But for a small kid... But I think you just have to do it. And it's not going to
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.760]   be the experience. The rule I heard from someone, "Just plan one thing a day." That's it. Your
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.120]   itinerary is one thing a day, at least when they're really young. Now that you're way past
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:28.400]   naps and early bedtimes and the ability to not miss like five meal snack times a day. You're
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.800]   past that. So I think it's going to be a little bit more enjoyable. But at the young ages, I just
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.640]   keep telling myself I'm building up the travel resilience so that in a few years when they really
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.840]   learn to appreciate things, we just have things so much more dialed in.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.880]   Yeah, that's cool. I like that. And yeah, it's funny. My kids at this point both go to sleep
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   after me. So I'm like the old man that goes to sleep at 930. I'm like fanatical about my bedtime.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   So yes, I do not have to worry about nap time anymore or schedules. But nevertheless, like I
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.320]   said, you have to make the effort. And I think that kind of going back to your question about
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.920]   experiences, I think it's, I think it's about making the effort. And, you know, you talked
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:18.720]   about kind of the loneliness of maybe not being in the office and not being around people all the
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:24.640]   time. And I think, you know, frankly, working at home and regardless of whether we have conversations
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:32.320]   like this or not, and also being financially independent and being home and all of your
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:39.760]   friends are at work. I mean, you have to make an effort to actually see people. And I think it's
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   very, very easy to get into a rut. And I think I have been in a rut for a while in terms of
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:56.880]   actually making the effort to see people that I want to see and do new things. And I think like
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.680]   that's something another thing, as you can tell, I'm a fanatical listener of all the hacks, right?
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.960]   Like one of the things you've talked about is like, and I think you've been bad at this over,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.360]   over COVID, but like that one thing a month. And that just always resonated with me. I thought that
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:17.280]   was super cool. The first time that I heard you, you talk about that. And I think like, again,
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.040]   with like the operating principles, like, can I, can I be looking for adventure? Like, do I have
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.640]   an answer to your question right now? Cause I don't like I could be asked, like, I'm going to
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:33.360]   learn how to, how to, I don't know, do archery and drive race car. I could BS anything you wanted
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.560]   right now, but it's not true because the only thing that I know for sure right now is like,
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:46.960]   my aperture is open to experience and fun and look and connection. And like, those are the
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:52.880]   things that are like rolling around in my head of, Hey, in conjunction with DaiwaZero from Perkins,
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:58.080]   it's like, Hey, you have some money, you have some time and you have people you haven't seen
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.880]   in a while. Like, what would it look like? What would it look like to get together with people
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:08.480]   and to do something just cool and different. And that I normally wouldn't do because I frankly
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.360]   haven't done it for years. So I think, I think that's where I am right now. So yeah, the next
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:19.120]   time we do this, hopefully I'll have an update for you. But but I think as opposed to it being,
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.520]   Oh, it stinks that I don't have any answers right now. I look at it the opposite of like,
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:30.800]   again, my, I'm just wide open to, man, wouldn't it be cool if I tried a handful of new things
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.440]   this year? I don't even know if I can be as adventurous as you at the one a month, but
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:41.120]   what if I tried five new things and just try to explore? So anyway, long story short is,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:47.360]   I'm going to, I'm going to see how this rolls. So I don't know, what do you think? Like I said,
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:52.560]   you used to do one of these a month and obviously with COVID and the world shutting down and you
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.360]   having kids, how has that changed and how are you looking at it now? You know, I talked earlier
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.880]   about my, my goal for the year, my bold move is going to be about valuing time and that kind of
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.280]   stuff. So I think what that allows you to do is make time for whatever that thing is, whether
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.200]   it's something you want to learn, whether it's something you want to do. You know, I was talking
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.160]   to someone the other day and they were like, we're going on a trip without our kids. You know, we,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.680]   our parents are going to watch it. And they had not done this. And their youngest kid was almost
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.440]   five. It was five. It's like, this is the first trip they're taking alone. So like,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.880]   and it's a weekend trip. It's not a, it's not a crazy thing. So I think you can make a lot
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.200]   of experiences that, that aren't the experiences of, of years past where it's like, let's take
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.600]   a two week backpacking trip to, yeah, that's a great experience. I just pulled off the bookshelf,
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.680]   Ben Nimpton, who I had on episode 36, who wrote this book called The Bucket List Journal.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.360]   And the reason I pulled it off is because I'd encourage everyone to check this out. We did
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:49.440]   an episode. You can get some of it there, but he created this journal that is about a list that he
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.560]   created with some friends and it's an insane bucket list, but he created a book to help people
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.520]   create their own. But the thing he did that I think is so great, and I'm reading his do's or
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.320]   don'ts. It's like, don't, don't, don't prior, you know, do's, go on a date a month, like run five
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.480]   miles twice a week. He was kind of trying to give people ideas, but he breaks everything into
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.520]   categories. And he breaks it into travel and adventure, physical health, material, creative,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.840]   professional, intellectual, financial, mental health, relationships, and giving.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.240]   So I want to encourage people that when you hear us say experiences and things you want to do,
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.560]   and you want to think about how to be ambitious with your years ahead, don't assume that every
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.920]   experience needs to be like jump out of an airplane or like the traditional, like big,
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.560]   audacious experience thing. You know, one of the things that I want I have on my bucket list is
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:44.160]   like to cook a seven course meal for friends. Like, you know, not necessarily go out to a
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.680]   fancy restaurant, but just to make this incredible, awesome dinner where you think about it and you
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.520]   plan it and you shop and you do all that. Like that is an experience. It's not jumping out of
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.880]   an airplane. You know, it's not traveling around the world. So I'm trying to prioritize things in
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.240]   other categories that I think are also really meaningful. And so that's something I'm thinking
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.800]   about this year. But another one, since we had so many topics on this list, we're not going to get
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.280]   to all of them based on our process. But when it comes to mine on valuing time, which I think is
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.440]   a big one for me, I want to share some of the things I've done and some of the things I'm going
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.880]   to do. I think that one thing that's really unfortunate... I remember sharing an app to a
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.160]   friend of mine and saying, "Oh, this is a great app. Paprika. It's a food app, right? And it's
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.480]   recipe management, meal planning, all this stuff." And they're like, "Oh, it's expensive. It costs,
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:38.160]   I don't know, $5, $10, $20." I was like, "Okay." But we've kind of trained ourselves to assume,
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.000]   "Oh, software should all be free. Content should all be free and all that stuff." Which is fair,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.160]   because it's not like we've been trained. It's not like we just decided this.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.840]   And I have a similar problem. I'm like, "Do I want to buy an app for $20? This is crazy. Most
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:56.560]   apps are free." But then I'm trying to equate things to "How much is this going to make my
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.960]   life easier?" And of course, $20 is a good amount. So there are a bunch of products that
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.680]   some of which I've partnered with, some I haven't, because I'm just such a big fan.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.200]   So Paprika is one. It costs money. And I love it. It saves me so much time. We meal plan on it. We
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:19.920]   grocery shop on it. I think it's great. Partners of ours, Delete Me, is this site that I think is
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.680]   an incredible product that will basically go and remove all your data off the internet.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.320]   So I went pretty deep last year on cybersecurity and how do I get my data off? How do I make sure
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.040]   I'm protected? I did a whole two-part episode series where I interviewed someone and then did
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.960]   a ton of research and published it. So you can go back and listen to those. But that was one where
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.120]   I actually started and I was like, "You know what? I don't know if I want to pay for a service that's
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.560]   going to go delete all my information off the internet. I could just go to every individual
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.120]   data broker website and do it. Why would I pay for someone to do this for me?"
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.000]   And then I started doing it. And one, I found that I spent 5 or 10 hours and I wasn't finished.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.680]   And I was like, "This is crazy. I do not value my time." And then two, after I did it manually,
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.400]   I was like, "You know what? Let's at least see if I got it all." And I didn't.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.320]   So I spent all these hours trying to do it. And then I realized not only could I
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.520]   pay someone to save me time, but I could pay someone to do it better than me.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:18.400]   So that was an interesting one and a product I love. I use 1Password. They're not really a
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.960]   partner of the show. I think there's an affiliate link for them if you sign up. But I think I make
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.320]   a dollar or something. It's not a big deal. It's just because I already love it, I might as well
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.480]   put the link in on the website. But just managing passwords, I'm glad to pay for a service like
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:39.680]   that. I'm glad to pay for photo storage. I'm glad to pay for... We talked about money.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:47.440]   I love a product called Kubera. And it is a product that replaces your spreadsheet
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.640]   balance sheet. That's what it replaces. And it syncs with all of the sites. It's a premium
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:59.840]   service. It's not free. But it's not hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars a year.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:05.200]   But it... I think it's $150 a year. But they've worked with all the data aggregators so that
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.480]   they use the best... Whether it's Platt or Yoda, all these ways you sync your accounts,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.000]   the best one for each account. And they just built all the features I want.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.520]   And now I don't spend an hour a month updating my balance sheet spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.760]   And it's like, "If I can save 12 hours a year, plus get some extra insight,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.720]   I wouldn't... Of course, I should be willing to pay something for that."
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:30.800]   And that's something I've gotten really in tune with. And this year, going forward, I'm like,
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.520]   "Maybe I need to try one of these virtual assistant services out." I just signed up
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.720]   for Fancy Hands, which I'm not sure if it's going to be the right fit because it's not
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.520]   really like a dedicated person that learns you. But I just want to get myself comfortable with
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:49.600]   paying to save myself time. Because I'm using that time to be creative with my business,
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.760]   which hopefully will generate revenue in the future.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.880]   I'm using this time to spend with my kids, which I want to do.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.760]   So that's been a really hard thing for me. And I think one of the biggest unlocks was
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:07.920]   starting to pay for products and services that will save me time. And it starts out really easy
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.560]   when it's hour obvious, where it's like, "I'm going to have someone help clean my house,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.240]   which I know would take me this many hours. But I'm trying to extend that to... I'm going to use
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.040]   this software that's going to save me time. Or I'm going to buy this product that costs more,
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.760]   but it's going to save me time." Are you good at that?
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:29.280]   I'm getting better. I'm trying. And I think I share the same affliction that you share,
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:35.360]   which is, "Oh, of course I can do this on my own." Or, "Of course, if that's going to cost a couple
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.640]   hundred dollars, I can do it. I can do it just the same." But like you said, it almost invariably
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.320]   takes way longer than you anticipate. And in the case of like Delete Me, you don't do as good a
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:55.360]   job. So I think I'm a work in progress on a lot of this stuff. I think it's just reorienting.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:05.040]   So I think even down to meal planning and cooking meals at home. So I, for years, my wife had this,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:12.080]   we have, I guess at chooseavai.com/meals, we have a PDF of like 30 recipes that she's curated.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.600]   They're not like her recipes. They're recipes she's curated over the years of... Essentially,
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.160]   it was like $2 per person per meal. And these are fabulous, delicious meals,
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:29.520]   like our like A+ meals in essence. And that's been fantastic. And we meal plan and we save time,
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:35.920]   we save money, et cetera. But it's still a lot of hours. And not to mention on the front side,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   but on the backside too, like you don't think about this, the cleanup, right? Like if you're
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:46.400]   cleaning up pans every single time and putting all the dishes away, it's like, it's 20 plus
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:52.960]   minutes for each of us. That's 40 person minutes, right? And then when you think about that times
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.520]   seven or times how many of our meals per week, it's just an absurd amount of time.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:05.200]   So I guess where I'm going with that is it's, I think we've been much more cognizant of our time
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:11.040]   recently. So we're actually spending significantly more on food recently and still in the cosmic
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:17.280]   scheme of things. It's not that much Chris, but we're able to get delicious food from one of our
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.720]   favorite restaurants and it winds up being like $5 per person per meal. And they cook it for you.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:28.720]   We get a whole... They have this like amazing, they call it like a Sunday supper. And the way
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.760]   that it works is you can get enough food that for us, it lasts four dinners for the rest of the week.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.640]   And it's like $50. It's absurdly cheap. And there are different things...
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.960]   Brad doesn't live in the Bay Area for anyone listening.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:46.480]   Where dinner for four that doesn't last the whole week is like more than $50.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:54.560]   Yes. I'm in a low cost of living area. I'm in Richmond, VA. But yeah, it's fun. Like it's
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:00.800]   actually fun because there's a new menu every week. We try something new. My wife, I mean,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:06.000]   this is not like, this is the way that things have been delayed in our house. Cause she generally
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.200]   likes cooking. She's always been the one who made the food. And she's been doing that for a long
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:16.320]   time. And especially when you have kids who we got into the bad habit of making different meals
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:22.080]   for people, which I don't advise at all. And she's just kind of done with it. And this is fun.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:27.520]   It's a lot of fun, frankly, to like try new food every week. And we don't have nearly as much,
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:34.320]   obviously on the front side, but on the backside also, they give you the pans to cook these things
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:39.920]   in. You don't have, there's no cleanup. So it's just, well, damn, would I pay $3 extra a meal
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:45.360]   to not have to waste an hour of prep time and cleanup time? Of course I would. A hundred times
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.760]   out of a hundred. And the food frankly is as good or better and it's different every week.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:55.840]   So yeah, I mean that like, you know, we actually just recently hired someone to clean the house
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:01.440]   once a month and that's been great. And just like little things, I think I'm kind of dipping,
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:06.400]   dipping my toe in here. I'm not maybe quite as advanced as you at this point in terms of,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.360]   I know you're thinking about like the virtual assistants and things like that. And I'm open
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:16.480]   to it. I think it's just more like, I need to conceptualize what, like, what does that actually
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.240]   look like? I can't, I can't get from here to there. And like, how are you thinking about that?
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.840]   Well, I did this episode with Dan Martell that you already referenced about,
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.480]   you know, buying back your time. And I consider Dan having talked to him to be like the pro. I'm
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.200]   like, you don't spend one second of your day on something that isn't a good use of your time.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.360]   And I'm not sure I have the roadmap on how to exactly get there. And some of the things he's
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:44.080]   doing require more capital than I'm willing to spend on it. But I'm working on it. You know,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:48.800]   like we experimented with hiring someone to drop off meals and do the preparation.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.840]   We're trying to, you know, we kind of go out or do carry out a couple nights a week just
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:57.360]   to give ourselves a break. We built bulk cook so that we, you know, have enough meals for another
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.960]   day. Like we're doing a lot of stuff, but I hope to have an update in the next time we chat,
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:07.760]   which is kind of some of the experiments and the results of them. But, you know,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:13.280]   for the interest of time, are there any other money things you're thinking about going forward?
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:20.560]   Yeah. I mean, money things. I am kind of at a crossroads with my real estate investing. So,
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.920]   you know, a bunch of our listeners have asked for an update with this is I went up buying,
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.360]   and I don't know if I ever told you this, but two single family rental properties down in Georgia
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:34.800]   a couple of years ago, it's probably three or four years ago at this point.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:40.880]   And I've never liked real estate. Like it just, I don't know, it kind of scares me. I had a bad
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.080]   experience of like kind of speculation back in my twenties. And like, it just scarred me for life.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.960]   And I think I've gotten over it to a large degree in terms of like, okay, idiot, don't look at this
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:55.120]   as like, you're going to make a quick buck. This is going to go up, like look at it as a business.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.720]   You know, I'm a CPA. I should be looking at this as a business. And does it have cash flow? Is
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:06.800]   there a positive net income? And what's the return on investment? So, that's how, so I actually bought
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:13.120]   both these properties in cash. And they've been great. I mean, they've returned phenomenally,
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.400]   like the bigger pockets, 1% rule. Now, obviously for anybody in the Bay Area, or like this is for
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:24.960]   your own personal residence, this is laughable. But for an investment property in rural Georgia,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:31.920]   or in Alabama, or in many places throughout the country, you can find it's like 1% of the
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   purchase price as the monthly rent. So, now for instance, I bought these properties after
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:44.560]   renovation. I bought them for basically $55,000 a piece. So, 1% of that would be $550 a month.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:51.760]   So, that would be then like a 12% gross return per year. But actually, Chris, I rent them for like
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:59.280]   750 and 800 a month. So, it's like 1.5%, which is phenomenal. And so far, and it's a small sample
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:04.400]   size, obviously, but I haven't been hit with any major, major extraordinary expenses. Obviously,
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:10.800]   there's always stuff that comes up as a homeowner or a landlord, but they've returned phenomenally.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:15.760]   And then that brings the question, okay, yeah, I kind of don't love real estate,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:22.480]   but these have been like an unmitigated success. And then I had somebody, I had Alan Corey on the
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:28.800]   podcast a couple of weeks ago, talking about, "Hey, maybe that sounds great. But do you consider
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:35.520]   what would that have looked like if you had bought eight of these with 25% down instead of two with
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:41.360]   100% cash in essence?" And so, yeah, I mean... What about those index funds? Those index funds,
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:47.520]   they're so easy. There's no overhead. Index funds are so easy. And that's the constant
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:55.280]   tension in my life, is I just want simplicity. Simplicity is everything to me. But...
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.680]   Chasing those returns. Yeah, those returns. And right? I mean,
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:03.840]   that's what it comes down to. You can know intellectually, but damn, those returns are
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.760]   great, right? And like, is that a small sample size? Is this replicable? Am I going to not sleep
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.160]   as well at night if I have a mortgage on something? So yeah, these are all kind of rolling
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:20.320]   around in my head. Or what are your time-adjusted returns? Because I promise you that buying that
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.920]   rental property and managing that rental property has a cost of time that is greater than how long
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:31.360]   it took you to buy VTI or VTSX or whatever index fund. And I don't know if there's an easy way to
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   factor that in. But I don't know. For me, the only real estate that we have other than our primary
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:44.320]   residence is a fractional home that we own, that we stay in. And that's it. We're not trying to
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.680]   rent it out. We're not trying to make money. It's just a good way for us to be able to have another
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.920]   place to go to. But I don't know. I've always struggled with this. I did this episode with
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:57:00.320]   Brandon Turner and he has all these... A real estate empire and has amassed a net worth far
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:05.360]   greater than both of us combined through real estate. But every time I think about it, I'm just
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.440]   like, "I don't know if I want to play the game." It's just not... It doesn't excite me. Being a
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:17.920]   landlord is not fun for me in any scalable thing. I just published a newsletter --as we're recording
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.880]   this today, but last week-- about house hacking. I love that concept. If we could build an ADU in
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:28.640]   our house, it'd be awesome. Being a one-off landlord and taking on that kind of little
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:34.080]   work is not too much. But actually turning it into a profession and doing it, it's for a lot
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.800]   of people. And I think a lot of people do really well with it. My brother and sister-in-law,
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.600]   they've bought up a bunch of auto repair and tire shops. There are a lot of businesses that you can
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:48.800]   own. And they can be very, very successful. And you could do well with them. That's just not what
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:55.440]   I want to do. But they've done a great job. And it's funny how real estate seems like the obvious
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:00.240]   alternative of what to do with your money. But then you listen to someone like Cody Sanchez,
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.200]   who's going to be coming on the podcast soon. And she's like, "I'm buying laundromats. I'm
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.400]   buying all these businesses." So there's lots of ways you can buy businesses,
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:14.240]   one of which is a rental property. But do you want to do that professionally or not?
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:20.640]   And what is the opportunity cost? If you put a little bit more time instead of into that,
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:25.200]   into your side hustle, or to your day job, or to the company you run or something,
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.880]   will that be as lucrative in the long run? It's hard to compare because there's no
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.640]   average return on investment of spending time on your side hustle.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:40.560]   But I don't know. I encourage people to realize that real estate has a time
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.440]   component that if you don't love, can feel like a lot of work.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:50.080]   Yeah. And I think a lot of the real estate people who pontificate about how wonderful it is,
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:56.480]   I think there's a large degree of survivorship bias to it. And frankly, you don't hear about
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:01.680]   all the people that got wrecked by leverage and just made stupid decisions. So I think there's
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:08.240]   some aspect of that, certainly. And no matter how I run the numbers, like even without factoring in
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:13.760]   leverage, because anytime you factor in leverage, there's always that risk of this going kaboom,
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:19.520]   right? And let's be perfectly honest with ourselves. But without leverage, even that
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:26.800]   1% rule, right? There are very few people, very few markets in the country that can find that 1%
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.920]   rule. Though, again, 1% of the purchase price per month in rent.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.960]   Yeah, you're not going to find it here.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:36.080]   Right? No, not in a million years. In the Bay Area, that's for damn sure. And I mean,
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:42.000]   that's a 12% gross return. And then again, bigger pockets, you mentioned Brandon Turner,
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.320]   they say you should anticipate about 50% of the gross rent as expenses. So okay,
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:58.400]   your 12% gross return turns into a 6% net return. 6%. That's not so fantastic, right?
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.120]   And then obviously, there's appreciation. But appreciation, in my opinion, is speculation.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:09.200]   You cannot bank on appreciation by any means. So it's speculative. But that said, you can
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:16.640]   anticipate a couple percent appreciation. So we're still back at 7%, 8%, 9%, which is
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.080]   pretty analogous to what we anticipate in the stock market. And like you said,
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:27.520]   it's a whole hell of a lot easier to buy VTI or VTSAX than it is to run a real estate rental
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.800]   company, if you will, or whatever you want to conceptualize it as. So like,
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.360]   is the juice worth the squeeze?
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.440]   If you enjoy that, like I enjoy optimizing my travel, great. I think it's awesome.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.120]   But just don't go into it thinking it's the best thing in the world. Yeah, I don't know.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.120]   Teach his own. Teach his own. And yeah, there are people that love it. But yeah,
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:55.520]   without leverage being included, because leverage can go both ways, it's no better
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.560]   than essentially anything else. And obviously, again, the real estate people will pontificate
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.160]   about the tax benefits and the 1031 and all this stuff. And there is that to some degree.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:12.720]   But yeah, if it sounds too good to be true, like you said, you got to factor in your time
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.640]   a little bit. I think that's important.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.080]   So the only other money thing I had was that we have an au pair from Italy. She's amazing.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.480]   And we're going to add her... Our last few pairs didn't drive, but she does. And we're
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.760]   adding her to our insurance. And when you add someone who hasn't ever had a license in the US,
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.280]   who's under 25, your insurance goes up. And so that inspired me to start going to reprice my
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.000]   insurance. And I'm going to do an episode all about insurance. So keep an ear out for it.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.640]   But I would just say it's amazing that every few years, different insurance companies completely
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.920]   change the way they price different things. And I've consistently in my life found that
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.880]   every couple years, I just send all... I keep it in a nice, easy formatted thing where I'm like,
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.080]   "Here's the level of coverage we need. Here's all the things we need to cover."
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.120]   And I'll just send it to a few insurance reps or brokers and be like, "Hey, could you give me some
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.400]   quotes for this?" Because for some reason in California now, most of the websites don't let
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.880]   you price yourself anymore. So this is just my experience. I went to State Farm, couldn't price
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   it myself. So I had to email it to someone. But I did that. And sure enough, I think I'm gonna save
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.960]   $600-$700 a year on insurance. It might even be closer to $1,000 just by shopping around and
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.040]   repricing. So that's my little fun thing for 2023 is if you haven't repriced your insurance in a
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.560]   little while, and especially if you got your home or your rental, you've got your car, maybe you've
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.840]   got an umbrella policy, you start to add all the things up, it could be worth shopping around and
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.680]   get a deal. Yeah. I think there are a lot of these little one-time-a-year things that you should do
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.640]   that a lot of us don't do, frankly. But at least to be mindful of it, like I said, throw it in some
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:02.240]   task list that you have come up in mid-January. And I think you could do it more often. But
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:09.200]   frankly, again, is the juice worth the squeeze? So I think one-time-a-year price insurance,
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.360]   one-time-a-year, hopefully at minimum, but certainly one-time-a-year, go through your
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.400]   credit card bill. Just line by line, are there any recurring things that you just forgot about?
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.840]   This happened to me a couple times with random Peacock or Hulu or some kind of Paramount Plus
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.320]   or some such. And like, "Oh, I wanted to watch Top Gun Maverick. So I got Paramount Plus. And
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.520]   I'm probably going to be paying for that for a couple months because I'm stupid and I didn't
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:43.200]   cancel it." So you should do that a couple times a year. RocketMoney is so good at this.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.120]   It's a free app. They'll sync all of your... You sync your cards, and then they scan for
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.480]   things that are recurring. And then they just give you like an easy view of "Here are your
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.320]   recurring subscriptions." Now, their business model is "Okay, is there a recurring subscription?
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.160]   You can go cancel it." Or you could just tap one button and be like, "Go cancel it for me."
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.280]   And you need their premium subscription to do that. But then they'll go reach out to whatever
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   company it is and just cancel it for you. And depending on the state you live in... In California,
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.160]   it's nice that brands or companies are required to let you opt out online.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.360]   But if you have a New York Times subscription, and you don't live in California, it's so hard
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.000]   to cancel. But if you live in California... Or by the way, if you don't live in California,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.440]   and you have things to cancel, next time you're in California, just go online and do that. Or
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.640]   if you have a VPN that has a California option, it's really easy to cancel online here.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.240]   That's very cool. That's certainly very timely, as I'm talking about doing it manually. We're
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.880]   talking about saving time. Saving time. Saving time.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.920]   That's the whole thing. But when you do reprice your insurance,
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.240]   make sure you actually look at how many miles you drive on your car.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.280]   So we don't drive that much. And so one of our car policies is priced at 5,000 miles a year,
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.680]   one's at 3,000. But if you don't tell your insurance company, they price it at 10,000 or
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.080]   12,000 a year. And you can actually save a ton of money just if you don't use your car a lot.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.320]   And I think a lot of us now that we're working from home more, might not be driving as much
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.480]   as you used to. So you might be overpaying for insurance, even without switching carriers,
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.000]   just because you didn't tell them that you're using less than whatever they
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.440]   set as your average mileage. That's a cool tip. I like that. I mean,
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.320]   that's easy, right? Like, hey, just a quick, quick email, quick phone call. That's cool.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   Yeah. I mean, again, I think we're describing like, how do you do simple things that it's just
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.880]   not going to take a ton of time, but like, and you've heard me reference to do as a bunch of
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:37.120]   times here, but just like, I want to offload because everything out of my brain, everything.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.080]   So I have all of these recurring tasks. And I don't think that's the best answer. I'm sure you
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.320]   have knowing you, you have some, uh, some better answer than to do this. I don't, I don't doubt it
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:55.280]   for one second, but for me, it's like, okay, if I am 100%, essentially adamant about putting
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.920]   everything in my life and to do this into to do this, then I don't have to think about it ever
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:06.720]   again. So if a task comes up, even down to like, I just renewed global entry. Okay. And I think
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.360]   literally the next time I have to renew is 2027. So I just quite literally put the task in,
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:21.360]   it comes to July of 2027 for February, 2027. And now I never have to think about that ever again,
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.320]   because I know when 2027 comes rolls around February, I'm going to see that. And I'll just
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:32.400]   very quickly, I have the URL for where I need to renew and it's just there. And that the
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:38.560]   psychological baggage of getting all of this nonsense out of your head, like when you free that
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.360]   it is truly, it's like the most freeing feeling you'll ever experience.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.680]   Because think about like all of those things that are rattling around in most people's heads of,
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.280]   oh, I have to do this next week. And then I have to make that phone call two weeks from now,
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:57.040]   whatever. You don't have to do that. Just get it out of your head, put it in this case on digital
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:03.040]   paper and your life is so much better. So that is probably like the thing that has improved my life
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.000]   most significantly in the last couple of years. And, but again, like I said, you have to be a
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.400]   hundred percent compliant with it because if you're not, then you'll always have that nagging
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.040]   doubt that, oh, is it really in there? Can I really trust this? But when you can trust in a
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.560]   hundred percent, you're golden. I do not have a good system like that. I do use this app called
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:28.160]   Trustworthy, which I'll call like the family operating system, where you can basically store
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:34.000]   all of your IDs, your vaccination cards, your passports, your tax returns. It's like a secure
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.960]   organized repository, right? You could have a Dropbox folder and put all this there.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:45.520]   But it's not as organized. This has an app. So when I'm at the doctor's office and they're like,
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.200]   "Can we reconfirm your daughter's insurance?" I'm like, "Yes, I know where her insurance card is."
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.080]   You get in a car accident, where's your car insurance? I know exactly where that is.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.000]   And then on top of that, I like it because you can nominate a person,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.240]   which for us is like my sister and my wife... Sister-in-law, it's like if something were to
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.120]   happen to you, let these people through some verification have access to all of our stuff.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.080]   So we just store all of our stuff there. And it actually has a feature like this.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:18.160]   You upload your passport or your driver's license, and you put in the expiration date,
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.000]   and then they remind you, "Hey, your driver's license expires in 6 months." So it's a little
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.040]   bit different in that it's not in one central repository. But for a lot of those expiring
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.640]   things, I have that in there. But I do think that I need to... I have not found a task management
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:42.720]   solution that I love. So I got to work on that. But we are well on our way to filling an episode.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.200]   And we had a whole topic of health. Do we want to jump into that? Do we want to do that again
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.760]   the next time? What do you think? Maybe we give a quick overview because I suspect,
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.040]   like we said, with a lot of this stuff, we're both... We're at the beginning of the year here.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   We're both exploring. And I think what could be cool is for there to be some accountability to
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.200]   the audience of, "Hey, we're going to actually follow through on this." Because I think that's
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.920]   what we tell our audience all the time is, "It's great to take in information. And that's all well
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.600]   and good. But if you don't take action, it's all worthless. So you have to get up off the couch and
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:26.080]   take action." And I think also, frankly, I fall down on this a lot. There are probably dozens of
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.240]   things that I promised over the years that, "Oh, I'm going to do this. And I don't follow up because
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.800]   there's no accountability." So it would be pretty cool, maybe on some level, for us to be
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.480]   accountability partners. And then by extension, the audience to some degree. I don't know if I
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.520]   have a... I don't have a prepared list of things I want you and the audience to hold me accountable
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:52.080]   for when it comes to some of these things. But I know you have a few on health. Why don't we
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.440]   set the stage for this at a high level and say, "Look, health is a big thing for us. We want to
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.000]   spend some time focused on it." If this is interesting as an episode, definitely reach
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.440]   out to Brad and I. If you're listening to all the hacks, reach out to me. If you're listening to
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.520]   reach out to both of us, it doesn't matter. But let us know so we know. Should we keep this up?
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.840]   Should we keep doing this? You don't have to send a long email. You can send Chris at all the hacks
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:20.640]   and say, "Do Brad again." I'd rather get the feedback than get this really nice response.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.880]   So whether it's on social or email or whatever format you like, I'd love to know what people
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.720]   think of this. And so we can come back and finish this whole health thing. What do you think?
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.480]   I think that's great. That's a great idea. And yeah, same for either your audience or mine,
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.840]   feedback@chooseavi.com or just get on my newsletter at chooseavi.com/subscribe.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.480]   And when you hit reply, it literally comes to me. So I'm the one who'll be reading all those emails.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:52.720]   So yeah, let us know what you think about this. And I think we kind of conceptualize this as,
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.160]   like you said, a conversation, just kind of a random show of, "Hey,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:01.200]   what's going on in our lives?" And I think just to set the stage for this, certainly for next time,
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:07.920]   is, yeah, I think my bold move, as I talked about with that episode with Dominic Cortuccio,
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:16.560]   is I want this to be my healthiest year ever. And I don't precisely know today how I can quantify
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:23.280]   that, but I'm not letting that limit me. I think where, again, with my kind of over-anxiety
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.200]   analytical brain, I would have let that be the limiting factor and not gotten started.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:33.360]   But I'm going in with an open mind of, "Hey, I want to experiment." So just a couple of things
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:40.320]   that I've been doing so far, which I think have made a big difference is... So first, you know,
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.440]   Chris, you know more than anybody, I am a massive fanboy of Dr. Peter Attia.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.680]   I've been following him since, I think, episode 50 of The Tim Ferriss Show, which came out maybe
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:58.560]   nine years ago, plus or minus, which is crazy. And he basically, he's a pretty high-performing
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.280]   athlete throughout his life. And a couple of years back, he decided to, what seemed like,
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:13.200]   basically stop a lot of his heavy training in favor of this program called DNS. So it's Dynamic
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:19.040]   Neuromuscular Stabilization. And it sounded fascinating to me because I kind of been
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:25.120]   plagued with some shoulder issues and neck issues. And everything that I tried was always a band-aid,
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:33.360]   and there was no actual substantive fix to it. And the more I learned about DNS,
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.040]   the more that I thought this could be the answer. And I've actually been going...
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.680]   Luckily, there aren't that many DNS practitioners in the U.S., but luckily, there's one here in
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.920]   Richmond. And I've been going to him for the last, really, month or two at this point. And
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:55.520]   Chris, I kid you not, it has been the best thing that I've ever done for my body. I feel so much
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:04.720]   better because it actually looks at the brain and nervous system as almost going back to
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:10.240]   developmental milestones from when we were kids, when we were infants. And if you missed a
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.280]   milestone, it's not like you were incapacitated for the rest of your life. Obviously, I've been
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:22.000]   a fairly normal person, but you always are coming up with some workaround. And what that leads to,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.800]   in a lot of cases, is injury and/or stress in certain spots. So very long story short,
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.680]   because again, we'll talk about this more in depth, is my neck and my hip flexors,
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.920]   which are constantly tight, have never felt better. I wake up in the morning and I'm like,
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.560]   holy cow, I can move my hips in a way that I didn't think was possible. I didn't think it
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.240]   was possible that I could feel this good. And that's just from a handful of times going to
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:56.720]   this DNS doctor. And again, with the experimenting and not worrying about money and just trying to
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.960]   explore this, it's fairly expensive. That's not covered by insurance. So I'm paying out of pocket
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:07.520]   every single time I go, but it's working. And I would be foolish, in my opinion, to not do it
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:13.920]   and to not continue just over dollars, which as Perkins would say, when you wake up and you're 85
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.520]   and you have more money than you could ever use, are you going to look back on whatever?
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.080]   And now he would talk about experiences and memory dividends and all these things. But in my case,
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.920]   I might get extra years of vitality out of spending this money. So to me, it's an absolute
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.320]   no-brainer. So there's that. The other thing is morning walks. I also listened to the Huberman
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.360]   Lab podcast a ton. So he's always talking about getting morning sunlight. And easiest way to do
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.720]   that is just going to walk. And it's just wonderful to be out in nature, peaceful in the morning,
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.360]   nobody's around, you get some morning sunlight. It's just been like these add-on effects.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.440]   And then I guess the third and biggest thing, though this is the newest, so I don't have
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.400]   all that much to it, is I hired an online fitness coach who I found through Twitter. I believed in
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:07.280]   what he was espousing, and he wound up having this program. And now, like I said before,
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:13.920]   I'm going in to the gym with Jonathan, my Choose a Vibe business partner, four times a week now.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.040]   And it's just awesome. It's also, frankly, like I talked about, making the effort for connection
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.800]   is now I get to hang out with my buddy Jonathan six to eight hours a week when I wasn't previously.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.680]   I'm working towards something because I think that's the other thing. I'm in reasonably good
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:35.280]   shape. So it's not like I'm going from couch potato to trying to be Mr. Olympia. That's not
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.840]   what we're doing here. But so I'm in pretty good shape. But when I go into the gym, when I go into
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.680]   CrossFit, I love it, but it doesn't feel like I'm working towards something. And I think having
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.840]   goals and having tangible improvements and having an accountability partner are really going to
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.720]   benefit me. So naturally, like I said, we're in week two here. This is workout number eight.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:05.120]   So it's a very small sample size. But I think the conjunction of all of these things are really
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:12.320]   working pretty well. And then it's a mindset of exploration and just wanting to be as healthy as
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:18.640]   I possibly can, because frankly, I'm 43 years old, which I still can't believe and not getting any
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:25.360]   younger, obviously. And the time is now. And I think that's how I'm thinking about it.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:32.000]   Yeah, I'm turning 39 this year. And my goal is to dial in health before I turn 40.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.320]   And I did an episode with Dr. Jordan Shlain. We talked about my... I've got high cholesterol and
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:44.240]   then the impact of that. So that's the thing that I'm tackling first. And through a combo of both
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:50.880]   medicine and lifestyle changes. But I'm very early in that journey. So I need to get...
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.520]   When you have two small kids and you start a podcast and you go full time on it, I'm just
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.240]   trying to... I felt like for a while I was treading water. And now I'm like, "Okay,
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.840]   we're starting to get things dialed in. We need to get the exercise back on the regular
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.160]   regime." And I think we've been doing well with food. So I'm not too worried there.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.600]   But that's the big one I'm focused on right now. Going back to very early conversation,
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.560]   I was talking about apps and how it's crazy to spend money. It's crazy how medical things are
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:27.600]   the same. It seems wild to pay for a doctor that isn't covered by your insurance or to pay for a
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.480]   treatment or to pay to get blood work done or blood analysis or DNA analysis, all these things.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:39.360]   But it also seems crazy to not allocate some portion of your budget to your health.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.600]   And so we actually had a conversation on that episode a few weeks ago about how do you think
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:50.720]   about what to allocate in your budget towards health? And after the fact, I emailed Jordan.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.960]   I was like, "Hey, I'm thinking about a doctor." So Jordan runs a concierge practice that,
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.720]   for me, is not within the budget that I want for my health. It's quite expensive. But I was like,
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.440]   "Do you know someone that I could work with? It's not as expensive." And he was like,
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.200]   "What's your budget?" I was like, "I don't know."
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.720]   Then I asked Amy and I was like, "What's our budget for health?" I'm like, "I don't know."
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.240]   So it's something that I need an answer to because I think... I'm not necessarily always
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:20.320]   the budgeting type, but a budget gives you permission to spend. And so in some areas,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   I feel like I don't necessarily need a budget. I know what's a reasonable amount to spend just
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.760]   instinctively. But with health, I feel like I need to create a budget. And I might even start
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.680]   doing this with an FSA, though open enrollment just ended. So I've got to wait a year.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.920]   But I feel like I need to force myself to be comfortable spending money on health.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.880]   And if I could create a budget that says, "You need to spend... You have $2,000 to spend on
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:50.160]   health." And maybe the answer is you say, "Whatever's not here, we're going to
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.120]   give away." Or whatever is something that makes it a little bit more accountable.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.360]   With an FSA, it would be like that. Whatever you don't spend, you actually
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.640]   can't use. You lose it. And so you could buy... I would encourage anyone who has an expiring FSA
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.280]   to go buy stuff that a local shelter needs and don't let it go to waste.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.760]   But I want to create something there because I feel like I need to force myself to spend more
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.760]   on my health. And that's a big one. So we have a whole list of 10 or 12 bullets of what we want
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.640]   to focus on with health. We're going to have to save that for the next time to be continued.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.680]   And we didn't get to travel and some of that stuff. So we got a lot. Kids... Brad's superpower
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.640]   is teaching his kids all these amazing lessons. So we're going to get to that.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:40.160]   But I feel like we hit on a lot. I feel like we... I'm jazzed to go do a lot of the things
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:46.160]   we talked about that you shared. This is awesome. Yeah, this is amazing. It actually... I knew this
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.320]   is going to be fun. It worked out even better than I anticipated. And yeah, it's pretty wild.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.280]   We have so many of these things, A, to follow up on. Like we said, this will be some accountability.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.880]   But B, yeah, there's all these topics we didn't get to. So I'm up for doing this. I mean,
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.560]   a handful of times a year minimum. I think this would be awesome. And I think it's...
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:09.920]   I think it'll be fun. I mean, super valuable. And obviously, it's always good to talk to you,
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.560]   my friend. So that's selfishly... Selfishly, that's the best part.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.040]   Yeah. So I'd say if you're listening, send us... If you like this or don't like it. I mean,
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.320]   genuinely, if you listen to this and you're like, "This was not a good episode."
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.680]   Please let me know. I want to create content that you like. Brad and I can have this conversation
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.960]   and not record it or record it. And so it doesn't... We're gonna have it anyways. So let us
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.360]   know. But if you do like it, send us topics that you think will be fun. If you think that you have
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:43.520]   questions that might be better suited for a conversation than just a response, send them in.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.840]   And unless we get a bunch of bad feedback, we'll probably do this again. And we'll see where it
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:54.160]   goes. Sounds like a plan. Very, very cool, Chris. Always good at chat. And yeah, until next time,
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:59.760]   like you said, please send in the feedback. Everyone listening, we'd love to hear it. And
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.800]   yeah, the cool thing is we could talk about anything. That's what's fun about
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.640]   these conceptualized random shows is it can be anything.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.280]   All right. Thanks for being here. Look forward to the next one.
