[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.680]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.600]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.360]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.140]   Today's episode marks the first in a series
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.700]   with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.240]   Dr. Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060]   at Cal State University, Fullerton,
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.400]   and one of the foremost world experts
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.200]   on the science and application of methods
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.060]   to increase strength, speed, endurance, hypertrophy,
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.100]   and various other aspects of fitness, exercise,
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.360]   and sports performance.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.720]   Across the six-episode series,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.680]   Dr. Andy Galpin pulls from his expertise
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.880]   working with everything from professional athletes
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.080]   to recreational exercisers,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.120]   and teaches us the mechanisms, logic,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920]   and specific protocols for how to achieve
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.260]   any of the number of different exercise adaptations
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.320]   that I mentioned a moment ago,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.520]   ranging from strength to endurance, hypertrophy,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.320]   and everything in between.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.460]   We get really far into details,
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.680]   but at all times,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.540]   paying attention to the macroscopic issues,
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.480]   that is how to create a program for endurance,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.360]   or strength, or hypertrophy, or speed,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.320]   or one that combines all of those.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.920]   We also talk about supplementation and nutrition
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.840]   and how to maximize recovery
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.500]   for each of the different types of exercise adaptations.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.400]   During today's episode,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.240]   Dr. Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.800]   and more generally, how to think about fitness
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.840]   so that we can best achieve our fitness,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.920]   exercise, and performance goals.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.940]   Dr. Professor Andy Galpin,
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.680]   super excited to have you here.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.340]   You're such an immense treasure trove of information
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.840]   on physical training and optimizing for specific goals
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.400]   and outcomes with physical exercise.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.620]   I'm curious, however,
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.900]   so many people have different levels of fitness.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.400]   Some people are professional athletes, of course,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.680]   but most people are not.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.480]   Many people exercise regularly.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.360]   Some people are trying to do that more.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.900]   Some people are doing too much of that.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.200]   They're over-training, they're not recovering enough.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.400]   If we were to take a step back
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.880]   and each and every one of us ask, "How fit are we?"
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.540]   With the word fit, of course,
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.000]   being a very broad encompassing word,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080]   you know, could encompass endurance,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440]   certainly it does, strength,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.360]   the ability to run fast, even if for short distances.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.660]   It might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.960]   trying to balance one's musculature,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.680]   to offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, et cetera.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.700]   How should I, or anyone else for that matter,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.120]   think about their level of fitness?
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.020]   You know, I know my resting heart rate,
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.960]   but what do I do in terms of really assessing
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.400]   whether or not I'm as fit as I could be and should be,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   both for sake of health and performance?
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.880]   And here I'm asking you the question, not as an athlete,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.540]   but as somebody who's been pretty consistent as an exerciser,
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.660]   but if we were to throw our arms around this question
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.440]   of how do we assess our fitness,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.800]   what would be sort of the different levels of assessment
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.680]   that we should think about and do?
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   - When it comes to exercise,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.420]   people generally have two major goals in mind.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.000]   Goal number one is achieving some sort of appearance, right?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.800]   This is, I want to be big, or I want to not be too big,
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.480]   or I want to be lean, something, right?
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.880]   It doesn't matter what that goal is,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.760]   but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.120]   They want to look a certain way or not look a certain way.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.840]   The other one is functionality.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.360]   So I want to be able to perform a certain way.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.440]   Now again, that definition differs per person.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.760]   So I want to be better at strength.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.420]   I want to be better at mobility.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.840]   I want to be able to have energy throughout the day,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.680]   whatever it is.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.600]   So there's some sort of appeal to aesthetic,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.960]   and there's some sort of appeal to functionality.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.560]   So within both of those categories,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   we want to be in a position where we can understand
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.760]   where do I need to go with my exercise training
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.280]   so that I can be as fit and as healthy
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.520]   and achieve these goals that I want now,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   as well as be in a position where I can maintain them
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.000]   for a long period of time.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.440]   So this blends both immediate goals.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.640]   So say you're just interested in squatting a lot of weight.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.620]   Say you're interested in running a 5K time the best you want.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.920]   It doesn't matter.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.340]   It blends that with the desire to have a long wellness span,
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.560]   to be fit throughout life,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.000]   to achieve all those things for as long as possible.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.240]   So then the question kind of comes back to saying,
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.400]   how do I know which area I need to focus on the most?
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.280]   And why am I not achieving these goals
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.700]   or how can I get there more effectively?
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.460]   And if we look at the big picture,
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.520]   we have to understand that there are several major
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.280]   components to physical fitness that are going to be required
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.520]   in all of these categories.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.160]   And to achieve that, there are a handful of components
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.000]   that have to happen to be able to hit those goals.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.160]   Now, there are infinite methods.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.480]   So the saying we actually use here a lot is,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.760]   the methods are many, but the concepts are few.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.400]   So what I'd love to do today is,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.640]   over the course of our discussion,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.200]   is hit exactly what those concepts are
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.280]   and then cover a whole bunch of different methods.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.240]   And we could do that for hours,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.120]   but we'll cover a number of them for various goals.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.360]   - So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.640]   and not into exercise science
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.320]   is because of this thing, neuroplasticity,
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.960]   the nervous system's ability to adapt.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.180]   But the more time I spend with you
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.560]   and the more I learn from you,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.600]   I realize that many, if not all of the organ systems
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.800]   of our body have this incredible ability to adapt.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.680]   And when we're talking about physical exercise,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.380]   there are incredible adaptations that, of course,
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.400]   involve the nervous system,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.760]   but also involve muscle and connective tissue
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.020]   and so many other cell types and tissues.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.240]   That said, when we talk about fitness,
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.840]   what are the major types of adaptations
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.240]   that underlie this thing that we call fitness?
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   And later, I know we're gonna get into
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.000]   how different forms of exercise
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.500]   can trigger different types of adaptations,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.120]   but what are the major adaptations
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.140]   that one can create in their body using exercise?
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.740]   - There are many reasons why one should exercise,
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.400]   and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.360]   But the physiological adaptations
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.760]   can be bucketed really into nine areas.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.500]   So the very first one is what I call skill or technique,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   so just learning to move better, more efficiently,
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.440]   with a specific position and timing and sequence
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.640]   or whatever that is.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.760]   This could be running more effectively.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.520]   This could be practicing a skill
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   like shooting a ball or an implement,
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   swinging a golf club, anything like that.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.680]   I call that skill development.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.000]   The second one is speed.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.460]   This is simply moving at a higher velocity
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.340]   or with a better rate of acceleration, okay?
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.940]   That's very similar to the next one, which is power,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.720]   and power is speed multiplied by force.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.620]   The next one then, of course, on top of that
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.400]   is force or strength.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.820]   Those are really synonymous terms, right?
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.000]   How effectively can you move something?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.240]   Now, this is often confused, strength, rather,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.520]   as muscular endurance.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.960]   So what I mean by that is strength truly is a marker
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.080]   of what's the maximum thing you can move
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.380]   or what's the maximum amount of force
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.560]   you can produce one time.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.180]   It's not how many repetitions in a row you can do.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.180]   That's actually another one of our adaptations
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.820]   called muscular endurance, all right?
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.220]   So that is typically under the order of like,
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.340]   say, five to 25, maybe 50 repetitions.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.960]   Think of a classic, how many pushups can you do in a row?
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.660]   How many sit-ups can you do in a minute?
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.540]   Things like that are muscular endurance.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.500]   Muscular endurance tends to be localized.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.960]   So this is specific to just say your triceps
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.420]   and your deltoids.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.840]   It's not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.680]   or anything like that.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.980]   So that's strength, number four.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.940]   Number five is muscle hypertrophy.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.740]   And this is the first time now we're talking about
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.060]   an appearance rather than a functional outcome.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.880]   So moving better, moving faster, moving heavier
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.780]   are indicators of how well you can move.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.380]   This is the first one that's just simply
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.900]   how big is your muscle?
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.780]   And that's muscle hypertrophy or muscle size.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.660]   After that is muscular endurance.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.200]   So this is how many repetitions you can typically do
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.160]   of a movement.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.540]   So think of how many pushups in a row you can do,
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.060]   how many sit-ups in a minute you can do,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.880]   things that are typically in like five to 50 repetition
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.860]   sort of range, and it is often,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.720]   or it is almost always local muscle.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.340]   So what I mean by that is, it is, I don't know,
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.420]   a pushup test is really how many reps
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.000]   that your triceps and pecs and deltoids can do.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.820]   It is not a cardiovascular endurance.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.520]   It is not a global physiological endurance.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.620]   It's specific to typically one or a few muscle groups
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.980]   at a time.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.500]   This is why you have to do multiple tests
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.540]   for sort of every group there.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.740]   After that, now we've moved into number seven,
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.460]   which is what I call anaerobic capacity.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.260]   This is more synonymous with maximum heart rate.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.000]   And now we're actually looking at,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.420]   rather than a single movement or muscle group,
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.000]   it is a total physiological limitation.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.620]   So it is the maximum amount of work you can do
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.980]   in say 30 to 45 seconds,
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.120]   maybe even up to 120 seconds of all out work.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   Think of your classic interval type of stuff here.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.140]   So how much work can you do at a maximum rate
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.100]   where you're gonna enter tremendous amounts
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.100]   of global fatigue?
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.720]   The next past that is maximal aerobic capacity.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.380]   And this is probably something like
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.900]   in the eight to 15 minute range
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.480]   where you're going to reach probably both
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.660]   a maximum heart rate as well as a true VO2 max,
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.940]   which we'll talk a lot more about what that is later.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.680]   So that is different from the previous one
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.280]   where you can't reach this in a matter of seconds.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.360]   It simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.160]   to where your VO2 max is actually going to be
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.440]   sufficiently challenged or an indicator there.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.640]   And then the last one, number nine,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.860]   is what I call long duration.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.740]   And this is just your ability to sustain sub-maximal work
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.020]   for a long period of time with no breaks,
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.580]   no reduction whatsoever.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.500]   This is often called steady state training
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.940]   or a lot of people just think of this
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.180]   when they think of quote unquote cardio.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.180]   But your ability to continue movement
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.700]   without any breaks or change or drop
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.640]   is the last and final adaptation.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.740]   - And for long distance steady state,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.740]   I'm guessing it exceeds 15 minutes
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.540]   because the previous one was eight to 15 minutes or so.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.140]   What sort of time ranges are we talking about
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.860]   in terms of this long duration?
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.700]   - Well, that's actually wonderful.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.620]   You're going to be anything past 15 minutes.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.340]   So really, if you look at a kind of a minimal number there,
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.340]   it's generally 20 minutes of what we're looking for,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.780]   but a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.820]   But anything past that would still be
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.160]   limited by your long duration endurance.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.660]   So your ability to sustain work over time.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.420]   - Okay, so given that there are nine
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.260]   different major adaptations that can be induced
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.340]   with exercise of specific types,
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.060]   is there any one global test or assessment
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.360]   that people can take or do that allows them to determine
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.940]   what level of ability of fitness they have
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.420]   in each and every one of these nine different categories?
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.060]   - There are probably dozens or more tests
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.700]   that you can do for each one of those nine categories.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.880]   And what I would actually like to do
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.100]   is walk you through my favorites for each
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.340]   and giving you both the scientific gold standards.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.860]   So if you had the ability, unlimited resources,
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.340]   what should you go do?
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.760]   As well as some that are equipment free,
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.480]   that are cost free, things that anyone can do
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.620]   across the world.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.820]   In addition to that, I wanna walk you through
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.740]   what those numbers should be,
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.940]   how do you identify if you're really poor in something
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.900]   or if you're great, and then if you aren't as good
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.780]   maybe in a category and you wanna get better at it,
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.520]   exactly what to do in terms of protocols
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.220]   for how to achieve optimal results in each of those steps.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.380]   - So I noticed in your list of the nine different
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.600]   adaptations to exercise that you did not mention
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.800]   fat loss or health promoting benefits,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.880]   which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.860]   Was there a specific reason that you did not mention those?
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.500]   - Absolutely, it's because those things
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.600]   are actually not specific training styles,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.560]   they are byproducts of these nine.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.400]   So what I mean by that is if you understand
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.060]   how fat loss occurs, which we can certainly talk about,
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.500]   you'll realize some of these nine protocols
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.420]   are effective for fat loss and some are not.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.700]   General health is the same thing.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.080]   When we understand what it actually means to be healthy
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.260]   from a physiological perspective,
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.980]   then the rationale for what to train for
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.500]   is going to determine itself.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.940]   So what I mean is, looking at things like
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.100]   in order to be healthy, you have to have sufficient strength,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.900]   you have to have cardiovascular fitness,
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.160]   you have to have sufficient muscle, et cetera.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.020]   Therefore, training for one's health
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.740]   is determined by those restrictions.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.220]   So for you, Andrew, you may need to do more strength training
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.500]   to be healthy, where me, because I'm strong already,
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.820]   way stronger than you,
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.820]   I may not need to do as much strength training.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.220]   So our quote unquote health-based protocols
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.940]   are based on our current status or limitations
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.760]   in physical fitness among these nine areas.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.580]   So what I would like to do today
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.940]   is to cover a brief history of exercise science.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.280]   And the reason is it's going to explain a lot
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.740]   about why people are not getting the goals
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.780]   in their exercise programs that they want,
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.620]   as well as give you very specific direction
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.100]   about what to do instead.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.660]   - I can't wait to hear all the things
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.460]   that I'm doing incorrectly
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.140]   and to have you help me remedy that.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.540]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.180]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.300]   It is also separate from Dr. Galpin's teaching
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.340]   and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.260]   It is, however, part of our desire and effort
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.580]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.020]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.580]   In keeping with that theme, we'd like to thank the sponsors
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.860]   of today's podcast.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.860]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.180]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.460]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.780]   with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.900]   First of all, as I mentioned,
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.860]   their supplements are of extremely high quality.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.580]   Second of all, their supplements are generally
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.620]   in single ingredient formulations.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.060]   If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.500]   you're going to want to focus mainly
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.620]   on using single ingredient formulations.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.400]   With single ingredient formulations,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.700]   you can devise the most logical and effective
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.180]   and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.480]   In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.460]   And this is, of course, important because we realized
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.920]   that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners reside
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.440]   outside the United States.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.360]   If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.180]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast, in particular supplements
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.360]   for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus,
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.540]   as well as a number of other things,
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.180]   including exercise recovery,
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.300]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.020]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.300]   Element is an electrolyte drink that contains
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.960]   the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium, magnesium,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.500]   and potassium to optimize cellular functioning
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.280]   for mental and physical performance.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.260]   Most people realize that hydration is key.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.360]   We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.620]   and perform our best.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.660]   But what most people do not realize is that the proper
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.700]   functioning of our cells and nerve cells,
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.840]   neurons in particular, requires that sodium, magnesium,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.860]   and potassium be present in the correct ratios.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.980]   Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.140]   need to be careful about their sodium intake.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.460]   But what a lot of people don't realize is that
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.740]   if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.340]   and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet,
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.300]   that is not a lot of processed foods,
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.380]   which of course is a good thing,
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.260]   chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium,
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.060]   and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.780]   Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1000 milligrams,
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.700]   that's one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.780]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium, and no sugar.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.140]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.880]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.020]   to get a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.840]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman

[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.500]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.580]   heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.460]   I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.020]   for about the last eight months,
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.340]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.140]   I'm sleeping about the same amount,
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.500]   but I'm sleeping far deeper,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.500]   and I'm now getting the proper ratios
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.540]   of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.540]   and slow wave sleep, and waking up feeling
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.060]   far more recovered mentally and physically.
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.060]   The underlying mechanism for all that
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.180]   is very straightforward.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.820]   I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.100]   about the critical relationship
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.380]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.300]   That is, in order to fall asleep at night,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.720]   your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.140]   in terms of core body temperature,
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.240]   and waking up involves a one to three degree increase
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.540]   in core body temperature.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.160]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.720]   you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.180]   to be one temperature at the start of the night,
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.960]   a different temperature the middle of the night,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.100]   and a different temperature as you approach morning,
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.580]   each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.420]   and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.640]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,

[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.220]   Before we get into how the history of exercise science
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.520]   informs the mistakes that we are all making
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.820]   and how to remedy those mistakes,
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.660]   I'm curious as to whether or not you have any favorite
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.420]   one or two studies that point to a sort of
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.840]   naturally occurring example of how people can become
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.260]   very fit in one area and not another.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.280]   You know, I'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.600]   that apparently have terrific endurance,
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.720]   but at least to my eye don't look like
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   they are particularly strong.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.160]   I'm also familiar with seeing individuals
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.420]   that are very, very strong, particularly on social media,
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.760]   but that don't look like they could walk up a flight
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.240]   of stairs, much less run a mile.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.680]   Do you have any examples of studies in or outside
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.460]   the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.320]   - There's a lot to discuss here,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.860]   but I'll answer it really clear.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.280]   If you look across the literature,
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   and this is actually back to as early as the mid 1950s.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   In fact, it actually goes back to previous to that,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.920]   to the Harvard Fatigue Lab, 1927 to 1947 area.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.960]   People actually were advocating at that point
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.560]   a combination of strength training and endurance.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.140]   - In the 1920s. - Way back then.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.120]   In fact, it actually goes prior to that in the late 1880s.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.820]   There's scientific evidence back then.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.320]   It became more well developed in the mid 1950s and '60s.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.980]   In fact, there was the initial stages
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.020]   of what's called the exercise as medicine movement,
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.300]   which is the movement now,
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.720]   but the initial stages of that
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.980]   actually root back to the 1950s.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.860]   I could actually go into that whole discussion
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.580]   in the story of how that all came about,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.180]   but that's the health as wealth mantra.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.780]   That came from the 1950s,
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.220]   from the scientific community then.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.820]   All those data points are going to suggest
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.900]   you need a combination of some sort of
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.220]   broad strength training and broad endurance.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.440]   Now, if you have a specific goal five months from now,
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.440]   you wanna compete in a race or hit a certain physique thing,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.660]   that's fine to focus on one area of training.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.180]   Certainly, if you're an athlete, that's different.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.020]   But if you wanna maximize health
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.300]   and overall functionality throughout time,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.240]   it needs to be a combination.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.400]   And to really, really highlight this,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.800]   I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I've done.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.080]   One of them we actually did in Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.260]   So I did this at the Karolinska Institute,
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.520]   which you probably are aware of.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   It's actually one of the founding places
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.740]   of all of exercise physiology.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.780]   Generally, it started there.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.460]   It was called something different back then,
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.040]   but really, our entire field came out of Stockholm
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.540]   and the Karolinska Institute.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.420]   And we worked with a whole bunch of cross country skiers
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.220]   that were in their 80s and 90s.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.020]   And so they were competitive skiers in the 1940s and 50s,
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.740]   and they had been skiing competitively
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.420]   for that entire duration.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.520]   So you're talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.380]   So these are 80 to 90 year olds living alone and healthy,
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.200]   and we compared them to a group of individuals
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.520]   here in America who are the same age,
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.680]   but were not exercising.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.800]   And what we wanted to do is to see and kind of look at
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.720]   what are these lifelong endurance individuals?
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.960]   What do they look like?
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.140]   When we brought them into the lab,
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.700]   which is, by the way, amazing,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.140]   to do a VO2 max test on a 92 year old,
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.000]   especially in a language that they don't speak.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.380]   You can imagine you're doing this in the hospital, right?
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.740]   And you're running people through, this is a cycling test,
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.400]   and so for a VO2 max test,
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.040]   you have a mask on your face,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.400]   you're hooked up to a metabolic cart
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.680]   so it can collect all the gases
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.340]   that are coming out of your mouth.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.120]   And you're chanting these people on,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.460]   and basically every minute,
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.260]   the workload gets harder and harder and harder
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.700]   until you can't complete it.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.720]   And we're doing this in a cardiology center,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.860]   and the cardiologists are usually waiting
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.740]   for their heart rate to get slightly elevated,
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.380]   and they stop them 'cause they're 85, 86 years old.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.660]   And not only are we not stopping them,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.300]   but we are screaming in their ears,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.500]   just like, "Go, go, go."
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.780]   - In Swedish or English?
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.940]   - In English, right?
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.000]   And then the translator,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.040]   but it doesn't take a lot of translation
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.740]   when someone's screaming at your face, like, "Go, go, go."
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.680]   So we ran them through a whole bunch of VO2 max tests,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.520]   and we did the same thing
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.260]   for those folks back here here in America.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.560]   And what was incredibly clear from that study
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.540]   was the VO2 max, you can think about these numbers,
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.740]   and this is what's called relative.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.140]   So, and the relative terms
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.160]   are milliliters per kilogram per minute.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.820]   And so a standard number is about 18,
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.700]   is what we call the line of independence.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.100]   So if your VO2 max is below 18 milliliters
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.940]   per kilogram per minute,
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.140]   it's very hard for you to live by yourself.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.880]   So your fitness is so low,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.060]   you probably are going to need
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.260]   to have somebody living with you,
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.940]   or you'll need to be in some sort of assisted living home.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.940]   So if you are in like the VO2 max of 20 or 21 or 22,
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.940]   you're not below that line of independence,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.980]   but you're on that threshold.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.280]   And so what we found was our folks here in America,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.420]   the group average was right around that number.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.000]   So they were living at home by definition.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.320]   We picked them to be people living by themselves
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.520]   in their 80s and not in a living room.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.840]   But they didn't have any bandwidth.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   So if they got a cold or they had anything pop up
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.320]   where they lost a little bit of fitness,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.900]   they were gonna drop below that line
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.700]   and would probably have to go
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.140]   to some sort of assisted living situation.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.920]   The folks in Stockholm, the cross country skiers,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.520]   the group average was most closer to like 35 to 38
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.060]   milliliters per kilogram per minute.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.600]   Now that number is about the VO2 max you would find
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.660]   for a normal college male.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.180]   And so these folks that were literally 80 or 90,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.420]   if the joke, if a saber tooth tiger ran in the room
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.260]   or whatever and it chased it down,
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.860]   and we all had to run to see who didn't get eaten alive,
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.600]   the college men would probably have gotten eaten
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.460]   before the 90-year-olds.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.980]   And in one case, we had a 92-year-old individual,
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.460]   and I think his VO2 max was 38,
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.860]   which was in our estimation a world record,
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.480]   the highest VO2 max for somebody over the age of 90.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.660]   - May I ask, what is the typical resting heart rate
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.660]   for somebody very fit like these older Swedish
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.500]   cross country skiers?
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.220]   That if somebody has a, let's say their number is
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.900]   35 milliliters per kilogram in this VO2 max test,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.320]   but since most of us don't have access
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.520]   to that kind of equipment,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.400]   but we can measure our pulse rate,
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.040]   what was a typical resting heart rate, resting pulse rate?
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.940]   - Sub 60.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.300]   Yeah, I mean, typically that's a good number to go off of
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.860]   for anybody, regardless of age.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.380]   Anytime I see somebody above that,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.060]   I'm gonna start asking questions.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.860]   Certainly above, you know, you'll see in the literature,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.400]   people will say 60 to 80 is normal,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.340]   and I don't agree with that at all.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.740]   If you're up, if you're resting heart rate
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.960]   is 75 beats per minute,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.920]   there's either something going on or you're not fit.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.240]   - How much cross country skiing were they doing on average
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.260]   in the previous, let's say,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.500]   if we take the previous 20 years
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.180]   since they'd been long-time cross country skiers,
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.380]   divide that by 20 years.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.220]   - Yeah.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.060]   - On average, are these people cross country skiing
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.420]   five hours a day, two hours a day, an hour a day?
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.500]   - Yeah, that's actually a good question.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.340]   I don't remember.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.220]   It's been many years,
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.660]   but they were not doing it every single day,
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.100]   and the volume would not have shocked you.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.460]   It was the consistency over 50 years that got them there.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.860]   Now, obviously these people were, again,
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.580]   world champions and Olympic gold medalists
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.160]   in the 1940s and '50s, so they were elite.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.680]   They just continued consistently over time,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.040]   but it wasn't a shocking amount of physical fitness.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.800]   They also didn't go out of their way to train hard.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.240]   They were busy chopping wood.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.380]   They were busy doing a number of other things,
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.200]   and then they just happened to do some of these races
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.360]   and ski a long way,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.440]   but it wasn't a crazy amount to where you're like,
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.300]   oh, that's great, but I could never hit that number.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.420]   It was something much more reasonable.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.960]   - So is the takeaway to be consistent
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.160]   about getting cardiovascular exercise,
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.320]   and we can define what consistent means
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   in terms of days per week a little bit later,
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.560]   and I know we will, what are some other examples?
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.640]   I love these examples from the real world.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.720]   - So here's the downside, though.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.820]   So I only told you about their VO2 max.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.560]   What I didn't tell you about
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.080]   is their leg strength and functionality,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.220]   and that part was no more superior
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.880]   than it was their counterparts who were not exercisers.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.480]   So what that showed really, really clearly,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.660]   and many other studies have been done since then
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.220]   that look at the classic what we call
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.760]   lifelong endurance exercisers.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.460]   You will see in general their VO2 max,
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.020]   their cardiovascular function, their resting heart rate,
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.000]   their blood pressure.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.980]   It will be markedly healthier
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.120]   than folks who don't exercise.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.240]   It is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.720]   is very important for chronic disease management,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.040]   no doubt about it.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.480]   However, it is not sufficient for overall global health
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.460]   because it does almost nothing for leg strength,
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.940]   for any other marker of health
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.080]   which we can talk about what are the things
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.280]   that are actually going to predict mortality
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.760]   more abated than most.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.780]   So that was a big smashing indication
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.880]   that it's like, hey, this is great.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.220]   However, you're leaving things on the table
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.200]   for your overall health.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.120]   Now, one could argue they're 80
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.000]   and they're doing pretty well,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.840]   but they weren't doing as well in these areas.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.440]   And so a study we did later actually as a follow-up
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.840]   was looking at monozygous twins.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.880]   So this is actually interesting being a scientist.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.420]   This is a classic example of one of my graduate students
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.260]   who had been in my lab for probably three or four years.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.420]   And she was in our single fiber physiology lab
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.100]   and you imagine she's isolating individual muscle fibers
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.700]   from an athlete one by one with the tweezer.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.000]   And she's going to do several thousand individual cells.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.480]   So you're down there for hours
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.980]   and things happen down there, you kind of lose your mind.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.280]   And she was just kind of going on one day
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.720]   with one of my colleagues, just talking.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.960]   And she's like, oh yeah, my uncle is really, really fit
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.440]   and something or other.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.560]   And then, oh yeah, he's a twin.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.920]   And it was like, oh, is he monozygous?
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   And she's like, yeah.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.760]   - For those that don't know,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.360]   monozygous are identical twins.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.200]   - Yeah, which is interesting.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.100]   So you basically have, what I'm setting up here is,
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.640]   this is the perfect exercise scientific experiment.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.440]   Monozygous identical twins mean
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.020]   they have the exact same DNA.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.440]   So an egg was fertilized, split,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.780]   and then two humans grew out of that
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.480]   with the exact same DNA.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.100]   And so now we can start answering the question,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.680]   well, yeah, okay, what about maybe
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.660]   these cross-country skiers?
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.260]   Maybe they were just genetic freaks.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.380]   Maybe it didn't matter.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.680]   It's like some people have,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.080]   well, genetics are always a component to it, but how much?
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.860]   Well, now we have a scenario lining up
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.620]   where it's like, wait a minute, you have monozygous twins.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.360]   So we have a replica of a human being, exact same DNA.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.740]   The only differences that we would see
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.580]   in their physiology now would be due
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.640]   to lifestyle circumstances.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.780]   Interesting.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.380]   So monozygous twin, a dad and an uncle, right?
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.740]   Uh-huh, great.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.980]   Do they exercise?
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.820]   Well, one of them does.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.460]   He's a lifelong endurance exercise.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.940]   Runner, cyclist, swimmer, iron man, all these things.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.600]   What about the other one?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.060]   Nope, he doesn't exercise at all.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.780]   And at that point, I wanted to kill my graduate student
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.180]   'cause I'm like, you've been in my lab for three years,
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.620]   or more probably, and you've never told me
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.980]   that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.820]   for exercise you could ever create.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.020]   And the look on her face when my colleague
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.340]   and I were staring at her, she's just like, oh my God.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.920]   So I'm like, call them right now.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.980]   They're coming in the lab, fly them in from Chicago.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.700]   I don't care what we have to do, we're getting them in.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.820]   And so I wanted to actually, going back to the model
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.620]   that was first developed by the Harvard Fatigue Lab,
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.160]   one thing that's interesting about that community
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.220]   is they started off with the concept
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.100]   of trying to examine human performance
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.280]   through a holistic lens.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.580]   And so it was the antithesis of looking
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.920]   at either organ by organ.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.100]   So we're going to only look at the cardiovascular system.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.620]   We're only going to look at skeletal muscle.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.220]   And then we're saying, we're looking at this entire picture.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.060]   And so that model, we wanted to carry through
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.140]   in these twins, and I said, all right,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.100]   I wanna bring them in the lab,
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.940]   but I'm not just going to look at one system.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.840]   I want to do everything.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.780]   So we took stool samples, we took blood,
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.900]   we did vertical jump tests, we did maximum strength tests,
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   we did MRIs of muscle mass, we did VO2 max tests,
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   we did efficiency stuff, we did genetic testing,
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.980]   we did an IQ test, we did psychological battery.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.680]   We wanted to look at everything to figure out,
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.380]   of these things, what differ between the twins,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.940]   and if so, the second key question there is, by how much?
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.020]   So can I improve my VO2 max?
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.660]   Sure, everyone knows that, but how much?
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.120]   Can it change by 5%, 80%, like where's the number?
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.900]   And so putting some quantification on this
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.460]   was very important.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.560]   And so, again, we had another example
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.660]   of a classic endurance-only training paradigm
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.860]   compared to a non.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.300]   So this is a person who's, I think he's a truck driver
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.080]   by vocation, which is, I think he actually drove
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.200]   for a potato chip company, which is even funnier.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.120]   The endurance athlete actually was great,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.940]   because like any endurance people, he had physical books
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.240]   of all of his training mileage for the last 35 years.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.580]   And we just went through them.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.680]   We calculated the total amount of miles he ran,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.720]   his averages, his heart rates per time.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.220]   We had this unbelievable thing, like what races he was in,
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.220]   he had the documentation, he was just totally nuts, right?
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.860]   Like, something that endurance people are shaking
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.640]   their head right now going, oh yeah, I got that too.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.560]   - And the endurance folks are pretty nerdy.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.300]   - Yeah, they're super nerdy, right?
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.540]   So it was great, because now we could validate,
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.880]   as close as one could, to actually how much he ran
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.800]   and things like that.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.120]   So they had about a 35-year discord.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.300]   They both exercised up through high school, about 18,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.880]   they stopped doing it, and by the time they brought them
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.000]   in the lab, they're in their mid-50s.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.980]   So it was about 35 years of difference.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.640]   And when we ran them through the testing,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.320]   if you look at the measures that were similar
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.800]   to the Sweden study, it was almost identical.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.160]   The exercising twin was significantly better
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.620]   at things like a lipid panel, resting heart rate,
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.020]   blood pressure, VO2 max, any of those markers,
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.280]   as predicted, were much better.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.920]   What was very interesting, though,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.280]   was the things that were in the middle.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.120]   First of all, their total amount of muscle mass
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.020]   was almost identical, like to the gram,
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.100]   within the margin of error of a DEXA scan
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.720]   could possibly ever be.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.380]   The non-exerciser, though, was a little bit fatter.
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.240]   So the difference in actual body weight
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.080]   was explained almost entirely by body fat,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.260]   or non-lean tissue, really, same sort of thing.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.900]   So okay, like no one's surprised there
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.560]   that the exerciser was a little bit leaner,
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.280]   even though it didn't change
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.820]   the whole amount of muscle mass at all.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.080]   When we looked at some of the more functional tests,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.800]   and we looked at things like muscle quality,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.160]   so this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound,
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.360]   you can kind of think about this
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.580]   as how much fat is inside the tissue,
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.360]   which is sometimes an advantage for endurance athletes
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.740]   to have a little bit more of what are called
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.960]   intramuscular triglycerides,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.920]   because it's a fuel directly in the tissue.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   But in general, the exercise, or the muscle quality
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.960]   was not in favor of the exerciser.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.200]   If you looked at the performance testing,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.900]   and if you looked at strength,
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.400]   it favored the non-exerciser.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.440]   So now again, we have the same finding
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.380]   we saw in our Sweden study, but in identical twins.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.040]   And so it really, really highlighted the fact that
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.560]   if you want to move forward with optimal health,
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.920]   simply picking one silo is not gonna get you there.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.720]   - One silo, meaning just running, just cycling.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.640]   - Right.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.960]   - Does this mean that the twin that did not exercise
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.680]   could jump higher or win an arm wrestling competition?
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.920]   Not that that's a vital thing to be able to do,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.520]   but just in terms of measuring strength,
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.080]   you know, it's our isometric strength.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.760]   Was the non-exercising twin stronger,
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.040]   or at least as strong as their exercising?
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.320]   - Yes, particularly in grip strength.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.360]   Yep, and any of the measures, like the vertical jump,
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.120]   leg extension power, and a number of things,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.320]   they often favored the non-exerciser,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.700]   which you're still a little bit of a chicken and egg.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.440]   You don't know if necessarily the endurance training
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.880]   reduced that other twin's strength,
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.040]   or it doesn't even really matter per se.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.440]   I think the highlight of it is,
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.160]   can you change some of these metrics of EOTmax?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.400]   Yeah, not even close.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.100]   These things are very responsive,
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.260]   regardless of your genetics.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.360]   Your genetics will give you a starting place, very clearly.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.180]   Even the non-exerciser was a pretty healthy guy.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.240]   So they were in a good spot.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.560]   Mid-50s, doesn't exercise,
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.520]   doesn't really pay attention to his diet at all,
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.320]   and he was in pretty good shape.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   However, if you wanna actually move progress
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.540]   and move for high functionality,
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.240]   you have to do something besides just run,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.100]   just distance run.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.960]   Now, I could say the same thing for strength training.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   That alone, 'cause I don't wanna make this seem
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.660]   like I'm saying endurance exercises, it worked.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.120]   In both case, in both these studies,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.700]   those folks were much better off in metrics
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.980]   that are incredibly important to mortality,
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.000]   how long you're going to live, EOTmax, et cetera.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.300]   It's just not gonna get there in terms of strength.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.120]   We took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well,
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.180]   which is very interesting.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.320]   So what I mean is,
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.300]   there's generally two types of muscle fibers,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.520]   fast twitch and slow twitch.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.500]   And one of the things that is a hallmark of aging
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.420]   is a selective reduction in fast twitch fibers.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.780]   And that's because it's difficult to activate them
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.400]   unless you're doing high force activities.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.040]   You're gonna activate slow twitch fibers
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.580]   doing almost any activity of daily living.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.220]   And so they stay around.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.080]   Fast twitch fibers,
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.460]   unless you're doing something of high force
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.620]   are going to not be used
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.420]   and they're not gonna be kept around.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.160]   And that's a problem because when you look at things like
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.020]   the need for leg strength through aging,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.660]   the ability to catch yourself from a fall,
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.560]   these things are incredibly important.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.080]   If you don't have fast twitch fibers,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.940]   you don't have the speed
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.580]   to get your foot out in front of you on time
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.040]   and you don't have the eccentric strength
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.940]   to stop the fall from happening.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.020]   And so if you look across again, the aging literature,
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.980]   they're very clear about the importance
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.520]   of maintaining strength and fast twitch fibers over time.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.660]   So we know that this is an important distinction here
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.940]   of role and people will often talk about,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.460]   okay, how much of that is genetically determined?
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.900]   Can I change my fiber type?
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   And the answer there is resoundingly yes.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.500]   And can I change it with exercise?
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.680]   And the answer is absolutely you can.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.220]   And then the next question is how much?
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.820]   So now again, we're gonna see an order of magnitude.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.960]   In general, without going too far down an area
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.820]   maybe we can save for later,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.680]   each one of your muscles in your body
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.180]   has a different percentage of fast twitch and slow twitch.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.100]   For example, your calf.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.160]   If you look at your soleus,
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.080]   which is kind of the smaller one that goes in the back,
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.120]   that's generally mostly slow twitch,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.920]   typically 80% or so slow twitch.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.760]   The gastroc, which is the other one right next to it.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.480]   So if you were to point your toe next to your face
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.300]   and that part that kind of flexes out in the middle,
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.160]   pops out, that's your gastroc.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.120]   That is almost the inverse.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.920]   So it's generally 80% fast twitch, maybe 20% slow twitch.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.720]   Generally anything anti-postural
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.600]   or postural rather, anti-gravity, spinal erectors,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.680]   things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.840]   are going to be slow twitch and things like your hamstrings,
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.680]   which are for explosion are gonna be fast twitch.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.320]   Well, we biopsy the quad in these individuals.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.120]   And in that muscle, it's generally about 50/50
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.120]   fast twitch, slow twitch as a really broad number.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.280]   Well, one of the things that we found
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.420]   was in the non-exerciser,
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.920]   it was almost textbook what you would predict.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.880]   It was about 50% or so slow twitch,
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.480]   a little bit of percentage of fast twitch
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.780]   and then about 20% of one of these called hybrid fibers,
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.960]   which are a hallmark of that activity.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.080]   All right, great.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.360]   In the exerciser, it was about 95% slow twitch.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.640]   And so it's extremely clear.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.500]   Again, I don't know if maybe their set point
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.340]   was a little bit higher towards that
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.720]   and the non-exerciser devolved down to his place
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.200]   or the other one, but it doesn't matter.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.520]   I mean, you're going from 40% slow twitch in one case
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.380]   to 95% slow twitch in another case.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.120]   It shows you that the limits of physiological adaptation
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.080]   are darn near boundless given enough exposure.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.600]   And in this case, 35 years of extremely consistent training
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.380]   and his muscle morphology was completely different
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.780]   than his identical twin with the exact same DNA.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.800]   - Those are two beautiful examples
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.780]   of people doing endurance work for a number of years
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.080]   and what that gives them in terms of benefits
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.180]   and functionality.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:16.080]   Has the opposite experiment been done or observed
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.920]   where somebody just weight lifted
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.920]   or just sprinted for a number of years?
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:25.120]   I don't know that there's a identical twin control.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.960]   That's a little-- - No, I wish
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.040]   we had a third twin.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.920]   - Too much to ask for, right?
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.320]   Triplets, okay, so triplets out there,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.680]   if you're exercising in different ways,
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.780]   or people who have triplets,
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.440]   maybe you assign one kid to be a runner,
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.400]   one kid to be a weightlifter,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.480]   and the other one to be sedentary.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.680]   Please don't do experiments like that.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.320]   But the expectation, as I understand it,
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.420]   would be that the person that sprints
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.380]   or that does heavy squats, explosive work,
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.700]   would then have more fast twitch muscle fibers in their quad
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.260]   and their non-exercising counterpart would have fewer.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.100]   That would make sense.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:03.620]   But what happens if you assess the endurance level
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.640]   in somebody who's just done strength training
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.340]   or just sprinted?
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.020]   - Yeah, so we don't have those data specifically.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.200]   We're actually just starting to have studies come out
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.480]   on lifelong strength trainers.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.020]   And there's actually a very good reason for this,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.300]   which is a whole story we can get into.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.520]   But the quick answer is we don't have a lot of people
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.580]   who've been lifting weights for 30 or plus years.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.240]   We have a whole swath of people
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.940]   who've been doing endurance training for that long.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.320]   - Is that because fewer people have been weight training
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.040]   or are the weight trainers all dead?
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.240]   - You gotta go back to the 1953, 1954.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.560]   You had two major things happen
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.000]   that changed the entire course of exercise physiology
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.200]   and exercise science, and really exercise as we know it.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.480]   It's important to understand the history of our field.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.480]   A lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.120]   of what exercise can and can't do.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.000]   As an example, questions like momentum.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.140]   Should I use momentum or that's cheating, right?
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.860]   Or it doesn't work, it compromises my results.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.520]   It's actually totally untrue.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.200]   There are excellent reasons
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.380]   when you should use momentum when you lift.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.040]   There are reasons when you should not.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.600]   It is sometimes very beneficial to go fast
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.800]   with the exercise repetition,
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.020]   sometimes very slow and controlled is better.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.440]   Any question I get, in fact, I'm very infamous
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.280]   for always responding with it depends.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.240]   The reason I say it depends is it depends on the goal.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.200]   When you're training for speed or power
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.020]   or muscular endurance, the answer to some
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.780]   of these very common question differs.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.200]   What people fail to realize is they think
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.260]   they're asking the right question
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.240]   because they don't understand this history,
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.540]   what's being planted in your brain subconsciously
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.800]   is driving that question,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.400]   and it's not necessarily the right one.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.100]   So if we walk through that a little bit,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.540]   you'll see what that field has led you,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.560]   why you think certain things matter
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.020]   when they actually don't,
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.120]   or maybe your assumptions are incorrect,
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.540]   and then exactly what to do about them.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.800]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.280]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.940]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic,
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.400]   and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.880]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.140]   I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012,
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.760]   so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.360]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.180]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.400]   once or twice a day is that it helps me
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.700]   meet all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.800]   That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.360]   and the probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.500]   Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens,
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.520]   which are critical for recovering from stress,
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.160]   from exercise, from work, or just general life.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.540]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.240]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.360]   to claim a special offer.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.880]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.320]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.960]   Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.500]   go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.940]   to claim the special offer.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.840]   - So in 1953, 1954, you had Roger Bannister
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.620]   breaking the four-minute mile, so sub four-minute file,
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.420]   and then you also had Sir Edmund Hillary
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.160]   and then his Sherpa Norgay, Summit Everest,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.320]   in the same basically two-year span.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.760]   That exact same year after that was a formation
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.720]   of what's called the American College of Sports Medicine.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.620]   Now, that is still around today.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.480]   It is a preeminent group for this exercise as medicine.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.400]   So if you're interested in things like exercise
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.120]   for obesity prevention, for cancer treatment,
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.800]   for things like that, it's not really sports medicine.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.980]   It's more for clinical exercise.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.600]   That's the place to go, American College of Sports Medicine.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.400]   So we have this launching of both a ton of people
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.360]   wanting to start doing endurance exercise
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.220]   and start swimming and cycling and running,
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.160]   and then you have a launch of people coming off
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.060]   of the back of the Harvard Fatigue Lab.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.120]   So the Fatigue Lab actually shut down in 1947.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.800]   So you have these people interested in physical fitness
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.280]   but know where to go.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.480]   Well, all those people left the Harvard Fatigue Lab
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.880]   and started their own labs in other places.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.720]   So you've launched the careers of people like Dave Costle
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.640]   and John Halazi and some of these
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.280]   very famous exercise physiologists,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.720]   and they start building laboratories,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.480]   and we start, for the first time ever,
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.080]   studying the science of exercise.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.600]   So years go by, and these people happen.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.580]   The 1960s and 1970s is what we call the runner's boom.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.220]   So people start, in fact, if you look at the numbers
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.100]   of people who are doing marathons,
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.400]   it explodes through these two-decade spans, right,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.560]   because it's like the, we could do these endurance feats.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.680]   Notice both those feats were endurance, right,
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.800]   running short-term as well as going over there.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.600]   No one has thought anything about strength training,
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.280]   and here's why.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.440]   In the late 1880s, there was a very famous physician
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.880]   named George Winship, I think was his name,
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   who was a big proponent of strength training.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.620]   Well, he died in the age of 50-something of a heart attack,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.540]   and that terrified people of strength training for 70 years
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.020]   because they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.540]   that stuff will kill you, 'cause he was a doctor,
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.880]   he was trying, he was running around the country
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.500]   doing these exhibitions and purporting it,
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.340]   and then he died.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.140]   - It's sort of like Atkins.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.980]   - 100%.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.580]   - Dying, although some people say he died of a heart attack,
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.420]   other people said he fell through the ice into cold water,
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.340]   that's debated, but the fact that a heavy proponent
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.740]   of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly?
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.560]   - Yep.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.600]   - Not good for business.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.260]   - So now, the little storm is brewing.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.380]   1940s, and I'm going back a little bit,
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.900]   but bear with me for a second,
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.020]   there's a guy named Peter Karpovich,
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.300]   and he's a scientist out of Springfield,
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.100]   like the Decorative Physical Education, PE,
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.120]   like that's a legendary place, Springfield College,
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.740]   and he is anti-strength training
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.860]   for a lot of the same reasons,
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.340]   and his entire career talked about, no, do this,
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.900]   he's the one that launched these ideas
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   that strength training will make you lose flexibility,
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.780]   it will be bad for kids,
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.580]   and all these things that we know now are clearly not true.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.020]   He's a proponent of these things,
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.860]   and there's a show that happened at Springfield College,
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.680]   and a guy named Bob York,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.300]   and if you, York Barbell, that's still around today,
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.460]   is going around the country
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.800]   and putting on these exhibitions,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.640]   they come to Springfield,
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   and it's sort of like a new-aged social media thing
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.060]   where it's like the students know what's about to happen,
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.380]   'cause Karpovich shows up to this event,
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.740]   and everyone knows he hates strength training,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.420]   and everyone's like waiting for it to end
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.720]   just to see what he's gonna say,
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.460]   so this whole exhibition goes on,
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.660]   and these people are doing,
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.540]   you gotta remember back in the time,
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.580]   like bodybuilding, weightlifting,
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.140]   powerlifting, strongman, it's like all the same thing,
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.200]   there's no differentiation yet,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.900]   and it finishes, and Karpovich stands up,
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.840]   and like the crowd goes silent,
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.740]   and he just asks one question,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.260]   and he just points to one of the guys and says,
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.240]   "Scratch your back,"
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.040]   and now he's just assuming and waiting for the guy
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.000]   to be like, "Ah,"
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.380]   and not be able to put his hand behind his head,
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.720]   and I think he pointed to John Gimmick,
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.700]   who's like a famous bodybuilder,
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.460]   and he reached back and scratched his back, no problem,
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.080]   and then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells,
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.400]   I think they were 50-pound dumbbells,
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.240]   and do a backflip, standing backflip with both in each hand.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.700]   They start doing the splits on stage,
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.680]   and they start performing all kinds
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.700]   of physical function tests,
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.180]   and Karpovich is stunned.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.160]   He's like, "Holy shit, he has nothing to say."
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.060]   He leaves there, and his whole life has changed.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.100]   All these things he was claiming
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.860]   were shown in his face to be false.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.760]   He does a 180 on his career.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.500]   He starts running study after study on strength training,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.080]   and starts finding immediately there are no detriments
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.220]   to strength training in terms of global health, right?
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.620]   Of course you can do it wrong and things like that.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.980]   In fact, here comes a whole bunch of benefits.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.560]   So through the 1950s, while this thing's going on
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.940]   with the endurance folks,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.980]   no one's still strength training,
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.400]   because there's no record to see.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.900]   There's no American College of Sports Medicine.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.820]   There's no societies.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.660]   There's no science.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.740]   We're not sure it's safe.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.420]   And meanwhile, Karpovich is just hammering
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.780]   study after study after study,
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.180]   showing you it's safe, it's safe, it's safe,
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.900]   but it hasn't picked up yet.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.120]   And then everything changed in 1977.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.680]   Thank you, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.520]   He came out with "The Trifold."
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.820]   He hits you with "Pumping Iron,"
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.700]   which I know you know that movie, right?
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.780]   "Pumping Iron?" - It's an interesting movie,
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.260]   even for those not interested in bodybuilding.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.380]   It's a very interesting movie
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:58.380]   because it really gives a window into not just him,
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.940]   but the way in which weight training
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:05.300]   started to show up as a regular practice.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.140]   When I was growing up,
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.300]   the only people who weight trained
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.620]   were people preparing for football,
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.440]   bodybuilders who basically didn't exist
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.960]   in the town where I grew up.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.300]   And the only people who did yoga
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.940]   were yogis doing Bikram.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.360]   But now you drive through any major American city
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.380]   or European city, and there's yoga studios,
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.960]   there's gyms with free weights.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.080]   - Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible, I think,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.960]   for initiating that shift.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.180]   - Yep, think about it.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.360]   He hit us with "Pumping Iron," "Conan,"
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.500]   and then "The Terminator,"
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.720]   almost in back-to-back, like very close within years.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.000]   So you've got this whole cascade of the '70s
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.640]   of people running, cycling and swimming.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.960]   Now science is starting to come out
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.060]   that it's not dangerous and maybe actually some benefit,
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.600]   and then boom, not only is it not bad for you,
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.980]   it can make you into a real-world superhero.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.040]   I mean, think about the psychology of a child
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.940]   growing up watching somebody like Conan.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.740]   Think about what Batman looked like
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.200]   in the 1950s and '60s, right?
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.120]   And then boom, I can look like that?
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.680]   Now not everyone wants to look like Arnold,
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.920]   but you see the power that can land in people.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.680]   No one had ever seen or thought
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.540]   you can make your body transform like that.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.560]   You could maybe be born like that, but no chance.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.800]   That's within the grasp of all of you.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.680]   - When I was a kid growing up, one of my favorite books
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.560]   was "The Guinness Book of World Records."
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   I still have images in my mind of the coldest animal,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.640]   the longest lifespan, et cetera.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.840]   And there was a picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.720]   and you know what his record was?
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.880]   It said, "Perfectly developed man,"
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.940]   which is, as you point out, that isn't the physique
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.740]   that most people aspire to,
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.840]   but it really did inspire this shift.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.320]   The other thing about resistance training
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   that I think has a certain allure for some people,
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.920]   men and women, is that it's one of the few forms of exercise
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.280]   that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscle
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.620]   that occurs during the training, the so-called pump,
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.120]   it gives you a transient but somewhat real window
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.240]   into what your results will be.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.800]   When you run and you're gasping for air,
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.220]   you aren't experiencing what it's like to be faster
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.360]   than you are that day, but when you weight train,
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.520]   you get an aesthetic picture into how your functionality
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.720]   and aesthetic will change.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.520]   It disappears a few hours later
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.280]   as the so-called pump subsides,
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.620]   but it's a very interesting form of exercise in that way.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.440]   It's almost as if you go in to learn a language
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.900]   and during the process of learning for brief moments,
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.120]   you're actually fluent and then it gets taken away.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.920]   It sort of puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.620]   This is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.240]   might have taken off the way that it did.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.360]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like if you got paid
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.600]   every hour on the hour when you're working
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.360]   and then at the end of the day, they take the money back,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.760]   but you still, as the time clock is going on in your day,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.960]   you're looking up and you're just seeing
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.320]   why you're watching your bank account grow in real life.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.880]   You can see why it's so addicting to those folks.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.680]   So to finish the story here,
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.620]   going back to your actual question to answer it,
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.200]   this is happening in the late '70s, early '80s,
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.420]   and so now, Joe Weider, all these gyms,
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.680]   they're exploding because people wanna look like that
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.400]   or they realize they have the chance
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.120]   to change how they physically look.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.780]   That had never been a reality before.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.140]   - Mostly men at that point I'm guessing.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.720]   - Almost exclusively, yet for a large number of reasons,
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.040]   cultural acceptance, et cetera.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.160]   Even with endurance stuff,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.260]   you could get fitter and run faster and that's better,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.960]   but it wasn't going to change how you looked
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.800]   unless you were losing fat.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.020]   Now you can change how you look,
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.520]   which is so incredibly addicting.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.040]   In fact, there's a very famous quote,
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.520]   I think it was actually Joe Weider who said,
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.360]   "Show me one man who wants to be strong
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.120]   "and I'll show you 10 who wanna look strong."
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.600]   Right, it's like, that's very, very powerful, right?
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.800]   There's tons of this history I can go into
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.160]   which is sort of explaining to you,
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.600]   but now you're in the mid-'80s
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.140]   and you have what I call my generation.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.880]   So you have my generation who fall in love
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.160]   with strength training in the 1980s and '90s,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.620]   but there's really no scientific field for it.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:05.960]   It's not really come about yet.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.520]   The science of endurance and exercise physiology
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.720]   is now humming along at a massive rate
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.880]   because these people came up in the '70s and '80s
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.740]   and they're five, 10, 15 years in their career,
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:18.580]   they're producing, they're generating graduate students,
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.600]   they're starting their own labs,
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.840]   and the exercise physiology still to this day
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.760]   is 80% endurance, steady state stuff almost exclusively.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.800]   Well now, my generation, you love sports,
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.780]   you love lifting, you love all these things.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.020]   And now what we see happen is the Chicago Bulls.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.800]   Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.040]   Ooh, that's on TV, he's on Sports Center
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.160]   in the mid-1990s lifting weights.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.520]   And we go back actually to the late 1970s,
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.640]   and I'm not sure if you're a football fan,
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.280]   but any football fan will recognize
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.540]   the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1970s and '80s,
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.160]   changed how football's played.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.760]   Well, the reason is because they started strength training
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.120]   and they started doing it with a guy named Boyd Epley,
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.240]   who was the founder of the NSCA.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.440]   So the National Strength and Conditioning Association
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.000]   is formed in the late 1970s as well.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.880]   So just like ACSM was developed
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.000]   the year after those two events happened,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.800]   1978, the year after Arnold comes out, boom, NSCA is formed,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   and now you have a scientific organization
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.840]   dedicated to strength and conditioning.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.200]   You've got NFL strength and conditioning coaches
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.760]   that are starting to come on board,
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   you've got scientists that are starting to come into labs,
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.800]   and strength and conditioning becomes the scientific field.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.580]   Well, everything swings now,
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.280]   from an exercise perspective, into bodybuilding.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.480]   And so almost all of the things,
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.840]   in fact, we were sort of talking before,
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.960]   I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.480]   and I could ask you a whole bunch of questions
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.400]   about things that you think are absolute standards
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.440]   or guarantees about training.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.760]   I'm supposed to do this, I'm never supposed to do that.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.800]   - For instance?
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.680]   - For instance, is it okay to train a muscle group
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   on back-to-back days?
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.960]   Most people are at home thinking,
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.600]   no, you're not supposed to train a muscle group.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.640]   - It needs to recover.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.820]   - And that's total nonsense, right?
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:02.120]   Other things like body part split training, right?
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.200]   Training one muscle group per day.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.520]   Other things like cardio, endurance training,
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.880]   influencing, will it ruin my gains from my lift?
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.800]   All of these things are on at a base of assumptions
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.880]   that come from bodybuilding.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.260]   Now that's a fantastic world,
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.800]   but because everything started in the late 1970s
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.120]   as bodybuilding, in terms of basically,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.720]   strength training was that.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.840]   Weightlifting and powerlifting were not at all around, right?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.920]   They were, but nobody cared.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.080]   Again, show me someone who wants to be strong,
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.340]   I'll show you 10 who want to look strong.
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.960]   The physique thing just dominated
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.380]   and we're not getting out of that yet.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.420]   We're not all the way out of it.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.400]   We're starting to though, because here's why.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.200]   People started to realize,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.040]   this bodybuilding thing is fantastic.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.400]   I can change my physique, I'm getting better.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   But damn, these workouts take an hour and a half, two hours.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.840]   And I'm gonna spend that whole time
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.240]   on one or two body parts,
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.160]   which means I'm gonna have to lift six days a week.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.800]   And I'm gonna have to do that consistently, right?
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.220]   Now all of a sudden, boom, two hours on my elbow flexors.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.620]   Damn, my elbow's starting to hurt.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.620]   - And yet, my understanding is that
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.060]   it doesn't really require two hours a day
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.100]   of training in order to get benefits,
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.700]   even just for hypertrophy.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.700]   - Totally.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.980]   But a lot of the times,
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.980]   you're gonna have to get some amount of time in
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.780]   because you're spending so much isolation.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.220]   So we've gone away from training movement,
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.200]   running as a movement, cycling as a movement,
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.060]   training my biceps as a muscle or muscle group,
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.560]   training my hamstrings as a muscle group.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.880]   That's not a human movement.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.840]   So we've done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.200]   from movement-based prescription
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.180]   to now muscle-group-based training.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.560]   So when you're isolating muscle groups,
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.300]   that means a whole chunk of your body
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:47.060]   is really not doing much throughout the day.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.840]   So what happens if you're doing, say, legs on Monday
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.700]   and you miss Monday 'cause you're on a flight?
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.860]   Now your legs have to wait a whole 'nother week, right?
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.300]   That's the solution to that.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.660]   So this starts to become problematic.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.820]   People start getting beat up.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.420]   People start realizing, I actually don't feel that great.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.380]   I'm not super fit.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.220]   I'm sweating just walking up the stairs.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.060]   I'm out of breath.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:08.880]   Why?
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.720]   Because all that training,
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.780]   you've done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:14.260]   You've done nothing to improve heart rate,
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.860]   oxygenation, blood flow.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.340]   And so that paradigm swing way too hard
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.140]   into the exercising, especially lifting weights,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.680]   is single joint, often machine, often slow,
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.240]   often high volume, isolation stuff.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.300]   And that left a giant opening of people going,
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.380]   well, wait a minute.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.100]   What if you could get in the gym?
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.380]   I could promise you the same or better results
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.940]   in under 30 minutes.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.380]   And in fact, you'll also feel better.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.860]   You'll lose more weight.
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:43.740]   And that opened up group exercise classes,
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.940]   kettlebell stuff, CrossFit type of stuff, circuit training,
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.720]   because you can come in.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.820]   You won't get so beat up 'cause the volume's lower.
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.260]   The time is much lower.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.500]   You get multiple adaptations at the same time.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.340]   Great.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.460]   The problem with that though, fast forward 10 years,
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.120]   is it started burying people
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   because you've now de-emphasized movement quality
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.260]   and you've overemphasized scores, right?
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.480]   So this is a classic example.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.540]   If you go and you watch "Pumping Iron,"
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.860]   you'll see, or any bodybuilder,
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.900]   you'll see if they're doing a bicep curl.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.500]   They don't even really pay attention to the rep range.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.700]   They don't really pay attention to the load.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.840]   They are looking at their muscle.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.680]   They're trying to figure out,
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.180]   how do I get that thing to fire?
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.900]   They're squeezing, they're flexing, they're posing.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.420]   At the end of every set, they're trying to figure out,
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:26.540]   am I getting enough pump?
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.740]   It is exclusively founded on exercise quality.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.060]   The rep range, the numbers, almost irrelevant.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.600]   When you go to the other model,
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.740]   exercise technique, it doesn't matter.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.280]   Just get the most amount of weight up
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.020]   or the amount of reps or the fastest time,
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:42.860]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.860]   High intensity- - This should be CrossFit.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.460]   I've walked past some CrossFit studios.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.300]   I've done two CrossFit classes.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.300]   - I don't wanna get sued, so you said CrossFit, I didn't.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.140]   - Oh, I don't know.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.060]   I enjoyed them.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.140]   I definitely felt like I was working hard.
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:52.980]   - Oh, you will.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.380]   - I observed a lot of people in very close proximity
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.300]   doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.940]   That's where you kick your legs, folks say,
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.660]   sort of like bucking and kipping type pull-ups.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.360]   No, I enjoyed it.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.960]   It wasn't for me for the longterm,
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.180]   but it did seem that there was a lot of ballistic movement
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.460]   in close proximity to other people.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.660]   So the hazard to me seemed more about that
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.080]   than the actual movement.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:22.020]   - Well, again, the point I'm setting up here is
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.500]   that was actually a really brilliant solution
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.660]   for a lot of the problems the classic bodybuilding
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.220]   hypertrophy introduced.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.000]   So it got away from isolation movements
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.820]   and got people doing big movements,
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.340]   which are more effective, generally better.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.840]   It got people doing things fast and explosive.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.860]   That's more athletic.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.460]   That is more important for longevity.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.740]   It solved a lot of the problems.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.340]   Joint health wasn't getting crashed.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:46.960]   The issue they went with is they just pushed the pace
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.860]   on score rather than quality.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.940]   They pushed the pace on how many people can be in here
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:52.780]   at the same time.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.240]   Now you're doing higher risk movements, higher intensity,
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.980]   higher fatigue, and with a total,
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.500]   not that they don't care about technique,
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.900]   but it's not the thing that they're most concerned about.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.180]   It's getting the number and the thing done.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.660]   They solved the time issue though.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.660]   You can get tremendous results in three days a week,
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.700]   under 45 minutes each session, et cetera.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.220]   Burn people out though, way too much high intensity,
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.460]   way too often.
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.700]   And the other problem, safety concerns,
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.900]   all kinds of orthopedic issues and other stuff.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.340]   - Can I interrupt you for a moment and just ask a question
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.100]   as we go through this arc of the history
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:30.700]   of why endurance training predominated or strength training
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.820]   or bodybuilding type training or CrossFit type training?
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.140]   'Cause I think this is fascinating.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.500]   I know we're about to arrive at where we are today
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.940]   and what the future looks like for people
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.780]   and what they should focus on and do.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:46.800]   At what point, if any, do you think resistance training
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.580]   started to become adopted by women?
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.620]   There was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.580]   There was Linda Hamilton in "The Terminator."
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.940]   There are some impressive physiques certainly
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:03.900]   on female actresses and athletes.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:07.260]   The Williams sisters, very impressive musculature
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.820]   and physiques and of course their tennis playing
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.820]   speaks for itself.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.900]   Has that happened yet?
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.420]   I mean, what I mean is, do you think,
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.060]   since you work with both men and women,
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.760]   do you think that most women understand
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.860]   that weight training done properly
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.020]   is going to be extremely beneficial for them,
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.940]   maybe even especially for them
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.760]   in terms of offsetting bone density loss
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.300]   and things of that sort?
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.700]   Or are we still waiting for the stimulus,
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:41.700]   the popular stimulus for getting 80% of young women thinking,
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.420]   I want to lift weights?
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:48.620]   - Yeah, hard for me to answer 'cause I'm not,
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.680]   like I'm not a woman, right?
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.900]   Now I have a daughter, she's four, so we'll see.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.060]   What I can say is I've probably worked with,
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.620]   I don't know how many professional athletes in total, a lot.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.380]   I've worked with them probably 14 professional sports.
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.520]   I've worked with Cy Young winners, MVPs,
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.820]   like the whole, all the credentials, right?
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:10.940]   I bet 35, 40% of the athletes I've worked with are female.
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:12.500]   So I've worked with Olympic gold medalists.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.900]   I've worked with bronze medalists in multiple sports.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.940]   I've worked with the most decorated powerlifter of all time.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.440]   So in a number of these areas, fighters,
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.040]   world championship, all these things.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.500]   For me, I feel like that burst has already happened.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.920]   My students, if you look at my classroom,
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.140]   I don't know what the numbers are,
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.960]   but there is no small number of females
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.580]   in exercise science and exercise physiology.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.120]   If you look at our laboratories,
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.100]   that's one thing you will see.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.200]   There are very few female exercise scientists.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.760]   There are very few female strength conditioning coaches,
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.980]   but that number is coming down at an astronomical rate.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.080]   You have people that are being hired in every sport.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.380]   You pick the NFL, you pick Major League Baseball.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:59.620]   Every few months, we're hearing first female hired for this,
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.080]   first female hired for that.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.940]   The Yankees, Rachel, Rachel Belkovich, fantastic.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:06.780]   You know, yeah-
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.780]   - Yeah, Rachel's been out to my lab.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.620]   She's terrific.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.420]   - Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, she's fantastic.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.140]   I mean, she's now being hired as the,
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.460]   I think she's a hitting coach now, actual sport coach.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.660]   She's gonna be a GM, right?
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.500]   That's just her goal.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.900]   She's a terminator.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.120]   So that's already happening,
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.820]   and my students that are coming through our program
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.500]   are getting placed in these roles.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.340]   They haven't gotten through yet a lot
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.700]   in terms of being an actual scientist,
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.000]   but they're getting there.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.700]   Sports scientists in the NBA are being hired,
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.580]   females in terms of like big data collection,
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.660]   sports science and tech we'll cover in another discussion.
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.220]   But I think it's happening,
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.300]   whether or not the cultural and social,
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.380]   I can't speak to that end of the equation.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.020]   What I can speak to, though,
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.820]   is one of the things I think is most fun
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.500]   coming forward scientifically is,
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.620]   you know, a number of years ago,
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.580]   the NIH came through with their mandates
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.760]   of saying it's no longer acceptable to exclude women
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.220]   from scientific research, right?
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.020]   'Cause we just did that for decades.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.900]   - Well, what happened, just to fill this in,
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.060]   'cause I think it's worth noting,
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:11.420]   is that for many years, studies even on rodents
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.960]   were mainly carried out on male rodents
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.760]   because the assumption,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.300]   and the assumption turned out to be wrong,
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.420]   but the assumption was that the physiology of female rodents
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.820]   because they don't have a menstrual cycle,
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.380]   it's not 28 days, they have an estrus cycle,
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.220]   it's four days, a different type of cycle,
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.420]   that that would somehow disrupt the data.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.300]   It turns out that that's entirely wrong.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.780]   Now it's actually required.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.580]   When you sit on a grant study panel,
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.540]   which is the people who evaluate grants,
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.180]   they ask, they literally say,
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.660]   did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable?
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.980]   Here, we're not talking about sex as the verb,
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.500]   we're talking about biological sex.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.260]   And if you don't say yes,
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.240]   that's a strong hit against the grant.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.380]   And if you say yes, then it checks off that box.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.360]   So it's now required that both male and female rodents
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.160]   and humans be studied in a given study,
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.100]   unless the study is specifically geared
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.380]   toward understanding that it only exists
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.820]   in one or the other populations,
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.220]   such as menopause, for instance,
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.660]   menstrual cycle, andropause, for instance.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.700]   But this is extremely important.
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.740]   I'm excited to hear that.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.660]   - So where I was gonna go with that is actually,
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.580]   so that was step one, which is cool.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.540]   You gotta include 'em.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.460]   Where we haven't gotten to yet,
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.500]   but I've seen more and more grant applications
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.420]   come through for this.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.680]   It's just the funding hasn't hit yet,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.880]   which is it's one thing to let women be in the same studies.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.780]   That's great.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.660]   It's another thing, though,
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.620]   to start performing high-performance research
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.940]   specifically for female questions.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.040]   That has not happened yet.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.460]   And that's just like a funding issue, right?
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.980]   We haven't gotten money yet.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.160]   People aren't supporting that.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.780]   We don't get a lot of financial support for sports science.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.340]   But we can't track down the money yet
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.120]   of me going, I wanna do a study in female athletes
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.540]   that answers female athlete questions.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.660]   These won't help men.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.980]   These are questions specific to the female.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.100]   That's the next step, right?
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.340]   That's where we gotta get to so we can say,
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.300]   maybe we should do things differently
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.780]   around training and recovery,
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.580]   or we shouldn't, or it doesn't matter.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.980]   There's a handful of, not lower quality,
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.780]   but some studies, I don't love them yet.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.400]   There just needs to be a ton of work.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.540]   Birth control is a very good example, right?
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.040]   The information for women at female athletes,
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.800]   or even just like hard exercises,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.460]   you don't have to be a competitive athlete,
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.260]   around what is birth control doing?
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.100]   What types?
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:25.980]   How should I manage that?
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.580]   What conversations should I be having with my doctor?
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.260]   Almost nothing.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.700]   Like women have nothing to go on for high-performance stuff.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.460]   So what if I'm trying to compete in an event or run a race?
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.060]   Like all those types of questions should be answered.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.540]   Normative value, normative data, performance testing,
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.180]   like it's just not there on the female.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.460]   So that's an area I think,
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.020]   like if somebody really wanted to make a change,
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.060]   the scientists wanna do it.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.060]   I know, I've talked to so many in our field
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.280]   that would really love to explore it,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.140]   because it's getting there.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.460]   Like I said, the coaching side is getting there.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.000]   They're seeing it, they're hiring these people.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.480]   I've seen it in my students.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.660]   You know, my following is not all men.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.520]   Like it's a very large percentage of females,
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.780]   and all I do is post about exercise science.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.140]   I'm like, this is all I do.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.140]   - Well, this podcast is very,
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.340]   we know very clearly the audience is 50% women, 50% men.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.140]   - That's right. - Which is great.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.420]   - So just to jump back on our history discussion
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.380]   and to finish that point of where we're at now
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.500]   and where I think we're going to go, or should go.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.300]   So we walked through the bodybuilding,
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.260]   kind of running everything,
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.660]   and people walking into a gym,
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.820]   anytime they lift weights,
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.520]   they're making all of their choices
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.940]   based on the assumption that maximizing muscle size
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.000]   is the goal.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.380]   And clearly that's not the case.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.760]   There are other adaptations you may be after.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.660]   So we talked about how that had problems,
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.000]   and then we talked about how some of these other forms
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.580]   of exercise filled those gaps,
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.780]   and then what problems those things introduced.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.060]   Well, I think we're actually at a point
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.360]   where that pendulum is kind of slowly shifting
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.380]   into the middle.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.580]   What I mean by that is,
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.100]   if you want to maximize muscle strength,
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.860]   we look towards the powerlifting community.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.100]   If you want to maximize muscle power,
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.780]   we're going to look to the weightlifting community.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.960]   If you want to look for muscular endurance,
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.800]   or well-roundedness,
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.460]   maybe we look into the CrossFit communities
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.500]   and some of these obstacle course races,
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.420]   or functionality things.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:18.100]   So what we can do now is generate protocols
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.900]   that get us the exact adaptations we want,
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.740]   and not ones we don't want,
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.820]   because we can look back at each of these different styles
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:29.120]   of training and pick and choose optimal protocols
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.100]   or combinations for them.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.620]   So if somebody simply wants to get healthy,
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:35.540]   like we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations,
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.580]   and I mentioned health wasn't one of them,
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.980]   that's because what determines your health
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.380]   versus what determines my optimal health differs.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.280]   So if I need more hypertrophy,
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.200]   I can look towards bodybuilding concepts.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.440]   But if I have enough,
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.860]   or maybe for personal reasons,
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.180]   I decide I have too much,
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.040]   or I don't want to add any more,
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.880]   then I can say,
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.460]   "Hey, how can I get stronger without getting bigger?"
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.620]   And boom, I look towards powerlifting concepts.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.860]   How can I get more powerful?
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.540]   How can I get faster,
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.080]   but I don't, again, want to lose fat?
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.920]   Okay, great.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.020]   Or if I want physique changes.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.580]   So we have all these different areas
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.860]   we can pick and choose from
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.620]   that have expertise in specific adaptations
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.500]   and develop ourselves perfect protocols
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.020]   based on that information.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.420]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.020]   to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.340]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.980]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.580]   to help you better understand your body
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.460]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.940]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.340]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.180]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.340]   and wellbeing can only be analyzed
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.540]   from a quality blood test.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.860]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.260]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.660]   is that you get information back
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.580]   about various levels of lipids and hormones
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.500]   and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.460]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.040]   InsideTracker makes knowing what to do
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.620]   with all that information exceedingly easy.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.500]   They have a personalized platform
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.160]   that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course,
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.580]   but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.080]   what sorts of nutritional changes,
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.180]   what sorts of supplementation would allow you
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.900]   to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.420]   that are optimal for you.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.780]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.460]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.000]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.180]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.360]   So with the understanding in mind as to how we all,
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:26.300]   myself included, arrived at such lopsided fitness,
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.740]   too much endurance, not enough strength,
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.860]   too much strength, not enough endurance,
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:30.740]   and it's really hard to imagine
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.580]   that anyone's perfect in this regard,
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.500]   can you walk us through the nine different adaptations
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.980]   that you mentioned earlier
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:42.980]   and give us a way to assess our level of ability
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.380]   or our level of adaptation in each of those nine?
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.860]   - All right, the very first one we wanna talk about
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.340]   is movement skill.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.200]   Now, set aside sport specific,
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.580]   so I'm not gonna give you an assessment
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.060]   for optimal golf technique, swing,
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.660]   is this really about human movement
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.500]   so that you stay injury-free
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.720]   and you can continue to train for as long as possible?
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.980]   So what are the minimum requirements?
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.100]   Now, if you can have access
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.820]   to a highly qualified physical therapist
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.620]   or movement specialist, that's the best route, right?
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.700]   Go to them, have them identify
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.700]   all of your movement patterns, overhead pressing,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.340]   squatting, running, all these things,
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.580]   that's your gold standard.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.100]   If you wanna do it yourself though,
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.660]   here's a very simple four-step solution.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:28.620]   So the way that I teach this is I go joint by joint.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.860]   And so I think of this just as the major ones,
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:34.340]   your shoulder, your elbow, your low back,
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.780]   hip, knee, and ankle, okay?
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.980]   Now, what you can do is do a representative movement for you.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.940]   So if you bench a lot, use the bench.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:44.260]   If you do pull-ups, use the pull-up.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.580]   If you squat, do that.
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.020]   I would recommend doing an upper body press,
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.340]   an upper body pull, a lower body press, lower body pull.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:56.020]   An example would be a push-up, a pull-up or a bent row,
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.460]   a squat, and then a deadlift.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.700]   That would be a very, very well-rounded approach.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.220]   What you're going to do is do that movement,
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.420]   and I would record it for yourself,
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.260]   and record a frontal view and a side view.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:13.940]   Probably do three to 10 repetitions per angle, okay?
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.620]   Slow and controlled, you don't need any body weight.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.740]   What you wanna do is move,
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:21.740]   and you wanna look for four key things at every joint.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.180]   So again, imagine I'm doing a squat.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.780]   I'm gonna do a squat, and I'm gonna focus on just my ankle.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.980]   And I'm gonna look for these four things at the ankle.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.220]   And then I'm gonna go back and watch my knee,
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.500]   and look for these same four things at the knee,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.380]   through the hip, et cetera, all right?
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.580]   So what are these four things?
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.020]   Number one is you wanna look for symmetry.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.220]   So symmetry is front to back, left to right,
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.480]   and your right limb and your left limb, all right?
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.780]   And so what we wanna look for are,
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.880]   if they aren't moving perfectly, that's fine.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.720]   But you wanna see,
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.780]   is one moving further ahead than the other one?
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.660]   Is one turning to the side and one's not?
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.060]   Is one fidgeting and twitching around differently?
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.820]   So you wanna look just to check,
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.340]   to see and make sure that they're stable, that's one.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.900]   Number two, you wanna look for stability.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.780]   So key indicators here are things like,
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.920]   if you can't control a squat,
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.060]   a controlled squat where your knees don't start shaking,
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.540]   like that would be an instability issue.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.900]   So can you do the movement slow?
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.880]   Can you pause at the bottom, maybe three seconds,
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.260]   maybe five seconds or 10?
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.580]   You should have complete control
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.580]   of that movement at all of these joints.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.060]   Are your hips sliding to one side when you stand up?
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.660]   Is one elbow closer to your body when you're benching
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.800]   and the other one's more flared out?
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.620]   These are the things I'm talking about, right?
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:39.140]   I'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.980]   You're simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.540]   All right, so again, as you're pushing up,
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.500]   does one elbow start flipping and twitching
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.020]   and going all over the place?
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.440]   The third one is what I call awareness.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.940]   So there are a lot of movement technique issues
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.580]   that are simply people don't know.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.860]   And so you'll watch them squat.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.280]   I do this in my classes all the time.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.460]   I'll have 100 kids out there squatting
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.060]   and you'll see some horrible squat technique.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.400]   And then when you just tell them,
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.620]   hey, did you realize your heels are supposed to be
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.260]   on the ground at all times when you squat?
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.340]   Like, oh, okay.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.180]   And they can correct it.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.460]   It's not actually a movement flaw.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.020]   It was just simply an awareness.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.280]   I didn't know and then I actually didn't realize
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.220]   that that was happening in that position.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.960]   So we want all of our joints to be going
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.940]   through a general full range of motion, which is number four.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.300]   So the ankles during like a squat,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.260]   your knees should be able to go
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.160]   as far over your toe as possible
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.620]   while maintaining good position,
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:30.180]   your feet flat on the floor, your three points of contact,
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.500]   your whole foot foot,
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.440]   and you're not compromising another joint.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.700]   So that's all you're going to look for, those four things.
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:40.700]   Symmetry, stability, awareness, and range of motion
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.820]   through each joint, through each movement.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.420]   It sounds difficult and time consuming.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.380]   It's really not, right?
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.220]   You can generally kind of clear these things
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.700]   in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds.
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.100]   And what you're really going to look for,
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.660]   there's lots of scoring schemes.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.860]   You can test that your physical therapist will sort of you.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.420]   I just look for absolutely terrible.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.040]   Like can't do it at all.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.600]   Minor flaw or pretty close to good.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.820]   But that's really all I'm looking for.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.380]   So my scoring system is zero, one, three.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.580]   Zero is like, you're not going to do this exercise
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.340]   'cause you're at a very high acute risk.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.660]   You might get hurt on rep one tomorrow.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.560]   Number one, like a score of one is like,
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.860]   there's a minor flaw here.
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.740]   We can probably do it, but we need to be cautious of load
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.600]   and volume.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.780]   The other one is maybe it's perfect, maybe it's not,
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:29.140]   but go ahead and sort of do it on a reasonable protocol.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.220]   You'll be fine.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.340]   So that's generally what you would need to do
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:36.140]   is a cost-free method of identifying good movement technique
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.660]   within any of the things that you would do.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.140]   - What about speed?
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.340]   - I actually don't think this is one
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.580]   most people should test.
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.980]   If you're a high performance athlete,
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:47.820]   we can run a 40-yard dash or we can do some different things
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.700]   with a velocity transducer on a barbell,
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.100]   if you're a weightlifter or something.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:56.180]   For most people, pure speed is really maximum velocity
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.720]   or acceleration or kind of the two ways we break it down.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.300]   It's generally not that necessary to test.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.640]   - What about number three, power,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.420]   which I believe before you told me was speed times force.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.480]   - So the reason why I don't worry too much about speed
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.100]   is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.300]   and a power test is easier to do
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.500]   as well as easier to train for for most people.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.700]   So the cost-free version here is a simple broad jump.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.420]   So this is stand with normal position,
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.660]   jump out as far in front of you as you possibly can
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.800]   and measure the distance between where you started
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.940]   and the back of your heel where it lands.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:36.200]   A super basic number to look for there is your height.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.540]   So you should be able to broad jump how tall you are.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.700]   If you're five foot five, you should have five foot five,
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.220]   six foot five, et cetera.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.580]   It's not perfect.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.860]   That's gonna ratchet down a little bit,
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.100]   about 15% for females.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.780]   They just simply don't have the power in general
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.620]   that men have.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.180]   And so you're gonna wanna bring that down a little bit,
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.980]   but that's a very crude number.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.700]   If you were to look at like a high performance NFL player,
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.860]   if they're six feet tall,
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.880]   they're gonna be jumping like nine to 10 to 11 feet.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.220]   If you can jump your body height,
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.580]   we're not looking for optimization in this particular test,
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.380]   what you are looking for red flags.
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:13.740]   If you can jump your body height, you're gonna be just fine.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.460]   - That's incredibly straightforward.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.300]   And yet I have one question.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.020]   I'm assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.920]   before I jump.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.340]   I can swing my arms from back to front as harder
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.820]   with as much momentum as I can muster.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.940]   And when I land, you said I'm gonna take the measure
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.720]   from where the back of my heels.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.620]   - You wanna measure the distance you actually covered.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.420]   So to clarify, there's no running approach here.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.540]   There's no steps into it.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.100]   You're gonna stand at a still.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.020]   Yeah, you can swing, bounce as much as you'd like to do.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.060]   You're gonna projectile off.
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:45.940]   So you're gonna measure the distance
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.760]   from the tip of your toe.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.340]   So basically stand behind the line
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:52.660]   and then the furthest point back where you land.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.580]   So basically the worst possible score, not the best possible
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.500]   'cause your feet won't land symmetrically.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.700]   One's probably gonna be a little bit farther.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.620]   Now, technically, if you fall backwards
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.580]   and your hand touches the ground, we mark that number.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.680]   But in this case, just use the furthest point back
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.860]   of your back heel and go from there.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.380]   - I'll be drawing it tomorrow morning.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.340]   - Now, if you have access to a little bit more technology
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.660]   or you just really wanna know a better number,
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.060]   a classic vertical jump is a good starting place.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.840]   So you can actually do this in a simple cost-free way.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.480]   You can just measure two of your hands, put them together
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.100]   so that both of your middle fingers are touching.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.900]   Overlap them and put them directly over your head, okay?
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.820]   And then you kinda wanna reach up as high as you can get.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.000]   And you mark that on the wall.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.500]   My brother and I used to do this all the time.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.920]   We would take a highlighter, the yellow ones,
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.180]   and color as much as we can on our fingertips,
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.020]   touch the wall so that the highlighter
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.240]   would stay in the wall.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.620]   If you actually go back to my house from my childhood,
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:51.660]   you'll see these markers all over our house.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.000]   - I'm sure your parents were thrilled.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.240]   - My dad didn't care.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.220]   Single, he didn't care.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.380]   He's just like, "Whatever you guys do, whatever you want."
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.260]   So you wanna measure that.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.740]   And then, of course, you're gonna jump
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.620]   with those two hands and touch as high as you can up.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.540]   And you're gonna measure the distance
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.520]   between your standing reach
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.300]   and the actual height that you jumped there.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.100]   Now, the reason you're doing it two-handed, by the way,
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.620]   is because if you do one-handed,
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.160]   you can actually reach pretty high
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.100]   by offsetting your shoulders.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.740]   And now you're getting into differences
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.980]   of who has more shoulder mobility,
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.780]   who has the ability to kinda get up there.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:24.080]   A two-handed standard approach is there.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.420]   Same thing, no running approach here.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.660]   You can dip, you can drive, and do all those things.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.520]   You can swing your arms,
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.700]   but you're gonna be a two-handed touch
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.100]   is a general way to do that.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.340]   You wanna look for a number
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:38.200]   of something like 24 inches or higher.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.280]   If you're past the age of 50,
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.120]   that number can come down a little bit to closer to 20.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.240]   And again, for females,
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.200]   it's gonna be ratcheted down about 15%
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.040]   everywhere you wanna go.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.000]   If you're a middle-aged female
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.240]   and you're jumping 20 inches,
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.640]   you're in a pretty good spot.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.920]   You're gonna be looking really nice there.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.800]   So now, if you can do that on a force plate,
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.880]   that's even better.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.640]   So these are very, basically, scales
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.460]   that will go out to multiple digits,
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:07.040]   sometimes five to nine digits past zero.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.000]   And you're gonna stand on these things,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.200]   you can do the exact same test.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.180]   And these are very interesting
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.420]   because they'll tell you not only how high you jump,
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.680]   but they'll tell you how much force you put into the ground.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.920]   They can also tell you how long it took you.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.180]   This is called your rate of force development,
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.720]   as well as impulse and speed and a bunch of other stuff,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.040]   which are important to help you understand
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.600]   where on the power spectrum you need to be.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.600]   So you would do that in addition
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.900]   to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.620]   So a very classic thing to do would be,
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:37.280]   let's say you're gonna do a squat
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.000]   and you're gonna put this device on the barbell,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.920]   and that's gonna measure the speed at which the barbell moves
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.200]   and you're gonna do that at 40%
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.160]   of your one repetition max, 50%, 60%, 70, 80, 90, up to 100.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.400]   And that allows you to create
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.720]   what's called a force velocity curve.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.540]   And you can start to see at what point
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.440]   when you start loading things heavy,
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.800]   do you start slowing down too much?
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.480]   And that'll tell you what part of the force velocity curve
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.040]   that you wanna train to optimize your power.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.480]   Why that's important?
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.400]   A lot of people will do things like when I'm training
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.360]   for power, how heavy should I lift?
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.820]   Well, the general answer people say is 30%
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.320]   of your one rep max, but that's actually not true at all.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   What's most optimal for power development,
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.400]   which we'll discuss more much later,
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.080]   is depending on where you're flawed
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.300]   in the force velocity curve.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.280]   So if you have access to technology like that,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.220]   that can give you a lot more insight and information.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.400]   If not, do the broad jump test
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.780]   or the highlighter on your fingertips
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.800]   and jump and touch the wall test.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.520]   - At Andy Yalpin's house.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.720]   - Hey, just, you know what, come along.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.640]   There's already, the walls are already messed up.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.200]   Just go ahead and come up to Washington and we'll do it.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.040]   - Fantastic.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.840]   What about strength?
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.160]   - Right, so strength is really important.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.360]   You need to measure this in multiple areas
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.200]   and we'll start off with grip strength.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.140]   Okay, so you can do this in two ways.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.940]   You can buy a hand grip dynamometer.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:58.340]   Now these are anywhere between 20 to $100 anywhere.
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.440]   These actually used to be like when I was in school,
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.600]   like hundreds of dollars.
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.760]   Now you can literally buy them on any website for 25 bucks.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.560]   So my honest recommendation is technically
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.900]   that's not cost-free.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.000]   I know your whole thing about the cost-free protocols,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.640]   but 25 bucks, I'm calling that basically cost-free.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.680]   You can bring that in and test that
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.640]   and that's just a little device where you're gonna squeeze
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.140]   and you're gonna do, and I would do your right hand
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.560]   and your left hand.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.660]   You wanna look for asymmetries there,
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.520]   but you wanna look for something like,
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.660]   typically those are, they're gonna give you a value
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.520]   in kilograms.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.080]   And you wanna look for something like a minimum score here
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.540]   of 40 kilograms.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.280]   Ideally you're up past 60,
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.620]   would be a really good spot to be in.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.080]   You wanna make sure that there's no less than 10% variation
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.400]   between your left and right hand.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.440]   Your non-dominant hand actually shouldn't be
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.040]   that much weaker in this test.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.520]   So what you'll actually see a lot of times
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.920]   is the non-dominant can be oftentimes stronger
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.800]   because the dominant hand is more for movement,
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.060]   precision, writing, things like that.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.660]   So you want them to be close.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:57.280]   If you are a male and you're under 40 kilograms
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.640]   on a hand grip dynamometer,
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.640]   like we're gonna need to train that.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.660]   If you're a female, it's not that much lower,
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:07.220]   but about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.320]   If you're above 55, we can add it to your training,
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.020]   but I'm not worried about leaving it out of your training.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.500]   If you're a female, if it's above 50,
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.180]   that's my sort of cutoff of where we wanna go.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.880]   So that's a fairly cheap one.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.680]   Another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.160]   So you can hold onto any bar,
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.680]   ideally one that is thin enough
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.340]   to where you can wrap your whole hand around it.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:30.940]   So you don't wanna be using a giant fat grip.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.540]   You're gonna have a false reading here.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.680]   So something like going to the gym
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:38.740]   and jumping on any pull-up bar or pull-up rack.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.860]   And you wanna hang, and this is a simple time test.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.480]   So in general, we should be able to hang
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.640]   for a minimum of 30 seconds is what we're looking for.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:51.580]   30 to kind of 50 seconds is my like good,
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.580]   but we could probably get better here.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.200]   If you're cruising above 60 seconds,
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.780]   I'm generally pretty happy.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.020]   This is actually a good example
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:02.060]   of when females tend to be better.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.780]   Grip strength in women tends to be strong
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.720]   and they can hang for quite a long time.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.620]   So those standards don't really change that much for women.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.440]   Now, if you are exceptionally large,
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.500]   this thing doesn't scale perfectly.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:17.260]   If you're 240 pounds and even if you're lean,
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.180]   it's just hard to hang and hold 240 pounds.
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:25.020]   Conversely, if you're 145 pounds, even if you're unhealthy,
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.300]   you're gonna be able to hang for a long time.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:27.680]   It's just not that much weight to carry.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.980]   So just rough numbers to start off with.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.180]   - So that's grip strength.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.280]   What about strength elsewhere in the body?
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.560]   - The primary ones,
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.720]   you can do an upper body strength test if you would like,
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.380]   although it's not technically something we do very often.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.040]   Happy to do one on max bench press
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.500]   or something like that, that's great.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.360]   The more, one I'm generally more interested in
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.980]   is a leg extension test.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.260]   And the reason I like this is a back squat is better.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.780]   A barbell back squat is, look, that's my like,
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.740]   that's my jam, that's my life, right?
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.700]   It's just very technically demanding.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:01.060]   And it's challenging, you need spotters, you need comfort.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.300]   A lot goes into this.
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.580]   So for the average person,
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.540]   a leg extension test is fairly standardized.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.680]   You don't have to worry about technique
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.900]   and people can just get into it and go.
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:13.340]   And so what you wanna look for there
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.820]   is a couple of standards you wanna hit.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:19.100]   Again, a very simple answer here is body weight.
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.380]   Can you do a leg extension with your body weight?
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:23.380]   - One repetition?
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:24.540]   - One repetition.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:25.820]   - I can answer that right now.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.900]   - Can you? - No.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.740]   - You can?
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:30.220]   - No, I can hack squat a reasonable amount of weight,
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.580]   but I was on the leg extension this morning
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.820]   and I was a Nautilus machine
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.820]   and I certainly could not leg extension my body weight.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:40.800]   - Let me clarify, were you doing a single leg?
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.640]   - No.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.340]   - So by ladder, you can't leg extension your body weight?
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:46.580]   - No, but I certainly can hamstring curl my body weight.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.420]   - Oh, okay.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.540]   So we maybe have some deficiencies in our quads
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.080]   that we need to go after here.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.940]   But that's a pretty good number you wanna be at.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.200]   If you go up in age past age 40,
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.580]   every decade that can come down about 10%
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.080]   and you'll still be in a pretty good slot.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.740]   So if you're 50 years old and you're 170 pounds,
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.240]   if you can do 160, you're in a pretty good sort of spot.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.940]   And then you can just, again, take it down about 10%
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.360]   every decade after 40.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.360]   But prior to 40, there's really no change in strength,
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.140]   but certainly somebody in their 40s to 50s
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.860]   should be able to leg extension their body weight.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.080]   - Noted.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:23.920]   (laughing)
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.500]   I look forward to our discussion a bit later,
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.040]   talking about how to build strength.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.820]   - Any of these strength tests,
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.900]   they don't have to be done to a technical true one rep max.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:36.260]   You can use what are called repetition conversion equation.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:39.880]   So put on a load that you think is kind of close
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.620]   to your maximum and just do it for as many reps as you can.
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.980]   As long as it's under five reps total,
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.420]   you can then actually go online
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.300]   and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.860]   And it will tell you, okay, you did three repetitions
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:56.660]   at 200 pounds, your one rep max is probably 215, whatever.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:57.900]   So there's estimate equations.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.700]   So if you don't wanna spend the time
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:00.780]   or you're not truly comfortable,
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.820]   like absolutely going to your true one rep max,
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.980]   just get to a number that's fairly close
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.060]   and do as many as you can, and then go online.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:12.060]   Again, one rep max estimator equations are everywhere.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.860]   If you get past five repetitions or so,
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:18.160]   the accuracy of those equations starts going down.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.620]   So don't put on something and go, I did 12 reps of it,
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.020]   and then try to figure out your one rep max.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:23.860]   It'll get close.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:24.820]   You start moving past that,
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.980]   you're just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.660]   So I wanna make sure whether you're doing
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.540]   the leg extension test or a front squat test,
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:35.200]   you don't technically have to do an absolute one rep max.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.900]   If neither of those are an option.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.040]   Another one I like a lot here is simply a front squat
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.900]   or a goblet squat hold.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.880]   So you're gonna hold a weight in front of your chest,
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.380]   whether a kettlebell is great here,
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.800]   a dumbbell is fine here,
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.140]   and you wanna hold about half of your body weight,
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:52.540]   go all the way to the bottom position
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:55.820]   and try to hold that for about 45 seconds.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.960]   So it's a pretty good indicator of,
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.140]   number one, your position.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.660]   It's hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:05.140]   as well as core strength and low back stability.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.620]   So it's a very different indicator
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.300]   than say the leg extension test, but it's a really nice one.
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:13.120]   So it doesn't require many moving parts.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.040]   It's more difficult than the leg extension,
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.800]   but it's quite a bit more functional
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.500]   and it's gonna give you insight into a lot more areas
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.840]   than just the quadriceps.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.540]   - So 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:25.180]   and then returning to a standing position.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.300]   - Yep.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:28.260]   And if you can't do the return,
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.860]   I actually, I'm not that worried,
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.620]   but as long as you can hold that good position
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.260]   without a technical breakdown in that 45 seconds,
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:36.400]   that's a really good spot.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.820]   As an intro, I want a third of your body weight
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:40.080]   for 30 seconds.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.920]   - Terrific.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.380]   I plan to attempt all of those strength tests very soon.
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.800]   What about hypertrophy?
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.700]   - Sure.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.680]   Actually, before we get into that,
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.020]   I wanna jump back really quickly.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.900]   It's important to add a couple of caveats
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.020]   to the strength training stuff.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.800]   So there's two that I wanna do.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.640]   Number one,
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.820]   these are assuming you are technically proficient.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.420]   So I don't want you to do any exercise to exhaustion
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:05.080]   or to maximum strength
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.880]   if you're not comfortable with your technique.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.660]   So adjust these accordingly.
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.340]   If you're not comfortable with the front squat,
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.180]   do the leg extension.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.220]   If you're not uncomfortable with that,
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:13.060]   do something different.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:16.120]   So we never want to utilize maximum testing
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.940]   if it's gonna come with a consequence
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.260]   of serious acute injury.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:22.900]   So that's the most important flag.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:26.100]   The second one is your warmup protocol
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:29.980]   will have a huge effect on your actual results.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.440]   And so whenever you do these tests,
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.220]   especially if you're gonna do a test
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.900]   and then a test again down the line,
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.740]   you wanna make sure that that warmup protocol
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.180]   is standardized.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.380]   Now, again, the NSCA, and I can give you resources,
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.780]   has specific guides for exactly what to do
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.580]   for your warmup protocol prior to one rep max testing.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:48.800]   So we can go there and you can look that stuff up.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.560]   We could add that to show notes or something.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.420]   - Yeah, and I think when we get into a deeper discussion
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.780]   about strength and hypertrophy
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.440]   and resistance training in general,
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.660]   if we could touch into the best warmup protocol.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:59.540]   I know I have mine
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.940]   and I'm certain it's gonna be suboptimal
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.460]   based on everything.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:04.300]   - Maybe that's causing a lot of problems.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:05.620]   - Based on every conversation we've ever had
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.480]   where I learned all the things I'm doing incorrectly,
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.700]   but I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.620]   It's not incorrectly so much as it is like suboptimal.
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.380]   - That's a very kind way of telling me it's incorrect.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.980]   Thank you.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.580]   What about hypertrophy?
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.020]   - So the thing you wanna pay attention to here is
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.600]   you have the aesthetic portion of hypertrophy.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.980]   That's entirely up to you.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.040]   There is no rationale.
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.760]   You can decide what you feel like looks good
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.600]   or doesn't look good.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.820]   That's irrelevant.
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.900]   There is a sufficient amount you need to have
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:37.260]   where below that is detrimental to your health,
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:38.620]   regardless of your outcomes.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.580]   And so the best way to do this is a couple of ways.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.660]   Any sort of body composition test can do this.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:48.540]   So whether this is a scan through like a DEXA scan,
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.100]   which is a gold standard,
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:55.020]   or other ways of bioelectrical impedance or other ways.
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.460]   So there's a ton of different tests you can get
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.940]   that are pretty close.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.100]   So what you wanna pay attention to
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   when you get like a DEXA scan is a number called FFMI.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.340]   And so that stands for fat-free mass index.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:10.100]   So you can look at, again, any number of online calculators.
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:10.940]   These are all standard.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.460]   So it doesn't actually matter where you pull them up.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.340]   You don't have to worry about looking it up
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.800]   and whether or not it's right or not or something.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.060]   And so that's gonna actually tell you
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.540]   if you have sufficient muscle math.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.300]   And so a number you wanna look for in general
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.580]   is something like if you're a man,
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.580]   your FFMI should be something like 20 or higher.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:31.420]   If you're a woman, you wanna look for something like 18.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:32.700]   So those are the targets.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:36.380]   If you get past like 24, 25 for a man,
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.340]   that's a lot of muscle mass, assuming you're reasonably lean.
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.360]   Now, if your FFMI is like 24, 25,
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.760]   but your body fat is like 40%,
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.460]   you're actually just a very, very large individual.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.540]   You're not in a great spot.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.340]   So when we say these sort of numbers,
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:55.420]   it's the assumption that you're probably sub 30% body fat
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.460]   for a man and sub 35 for a woman.
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.300]   So those are the numbers.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.620]   There are online calculators.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:03.460]   All you really need to know is your total body weight,
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.860]   your body fat percentage, and then your height.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.500]   You can enter those three numbers
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.300]   and then they'll tell you your FFMI score
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.460]   and it'll correct for an adjusted value.
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.820]   And most of those will actually tell you
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:16.100]   the grading rubric and then say good, average, bad, et cetera.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.220]   But those are the numbers we look at.
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:23.220]   If you are as a man sub 17, as a woman sub 15,
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:26.820]   now we're in an area of pretty severe
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.620]   physiological detriment for insufficient muscle.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:31.300]   And some of our later discussions
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:32.540]   we'll talk about why that matters.
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:35.300]   - So that's not sub 17% body fat.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.620]   That's just specifically the FFMI.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.740]   - That's correct, yeah.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.720]   - What about muscular endurance?
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.780]   Is this where you're gonna tell me I need to do walsets?
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:44.980]   - So this is really nice.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.420]   You can do any number of tests here.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:52.420]   A standard plank is a good testament of muscular endurance.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.940]   So can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds?
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.280]   Can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds?
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.300]   Pretty easy.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.380]   If you're able to do a pushup.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.040]   So if you can't, that sort of tells you alone.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.200]   It's actually interesting.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.540]   If you can't do a single pushup,
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.420]   that's not a muscular endurance issue.
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:09.940]   That's actually now a strength issue.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:12.280]   'Cause that's a one or at max problem.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.920]   So we want to be able to do, again, for a general male,
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.180]   we should have no problem doing
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.900]   25 plus consecutive pushups.
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.220]   - I apologize for interrupting you,
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:23.680]   but as long as we're talking about pushups,
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.180]   you just mentioned form.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:28.100]   Are we talking chest touching the ground?
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.400]   Elbows breaking right angles?
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.220]   What is a proper pushup according to your laboratory?
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.000]   - Unless you have a very specific reason
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.760]   to limit range of motion,
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.980]   I want all my testing done
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.600]   through a full joint range of motion.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.500]   This is different for the person.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.940]   So it's individualized to them.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.220]   But in general, for a pushup,
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.400]   this would be a full complete lockout
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.660]   of the elbows on the top
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.780]   and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.900]   You can do it different.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.760]   It doesn't really matter,
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.580]   but just keep it standard from your pre-test,
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:59.140]   your post-test, if you're trying to mark progress.
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:01.300]   But for us, unless we have a very specific reason,
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.180]   we're going full range of motion for all of these tests.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:06.580]   - So 25 pushups for a male?
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:08.820]   - 25 pushups for a male is a standard.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:11.280]   And even something like 10 is a number we're looking for.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:14.420]   Again, it's kind of minimum categories
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.340]   for an upper body muscular endurance.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.980]   - And not to get too down in the weeds,
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:20.700]   but I have observed other people,
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.220]   of course, never myself, no, I'm kidding,
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:26.160]   but observed other people pausing maybe at repetition 15,
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.760]   catching their breath and then continuing.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.380]   Or are you saying continue like a piston?
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.220]   - That would be a failed test.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.700]   - So no pauses. - Correct.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.500]   - Just up, down, up, down,
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.340]   trying to hit at least 10, but ideally 25.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:40.620]   - I learned this lesson in one of our studies
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:44.140]   probably nine years ago, where we didn't clarify that.
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.460]   And so we actually had an individual,
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:47.700]   he wasn't being nefarious.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.400]   He just figured out if I do a couple,
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.900]   take a quick break and do a couple,
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:56.420]   he quadrupled his post-test results from his pre-test result
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:59.280]   because he figured out that little hack there.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.780]   So you want to standardize it.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.060]   It's not that I'm against
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.780]   or have some sort of strong belief.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.060]   It's just trying to keep protocol standardized
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.560]   and which means any break, failed test.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.400]   - So 10 to 25 pushups minimum for males.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.200]   What about for females? - Yeah, so I'll clarify.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.340]   If it's sub 10 for a man,
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:19.900]   that's again in your like very severe red flag problem.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:22.460]   We really, really like to see a number above 25.
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.700]   Okay, that's where we're anchoring.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:28.700]   Anything between 10 and 25 is like, yeah, but not severe.
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:31.180]   - It means they have work to do.
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.300]   - We have work to do.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.980]   - And for females?
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.540]   - For a female, you're going to scale that sort of back.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.540]   So a female, the answer could be as little as zero, right?
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.160]   So you're going to see that, can you do a full position?
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.120]   If they're in that position,
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:43.300]   we're generally not going to do
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.500]   a muscular endurance test from the knees.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.180]   We already know the answer is you're zero.
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:49.500]   We'll actually default to another test,
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.700]   which I'll talk about in a second here.
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.260]   So for those folks,
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:54.500]   that's going to scale down a little bit, right?
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.820]   So basically you're looking at 15 is that marker,
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:00.220]   like 25 was for the male where I want to see above 15.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.260]   And if I do, we're good.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:05.180]   Anything between five to 15 is a number of like, okay.
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:10.500]   If you're sub five, like we generally have some problems.
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:13.600]   And if that is different between one and zero,
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.620]   then like now zero is a problem.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.920]   So we should be able to do that.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.880]   - So if a female cannot do 10 full pushups.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.940]   - Yeah, 10 full pushups is hard
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.180]   for a female depending on size.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.680]   - Okay, let's say a female can't do five full pushups.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.120]   You said rather than go to a knees down version,
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.600]   what would you do to assess their muscular endurance?
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.900]   And would you then also encourage them
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.480]   to work on their strength?
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.060]   - Well, absolutely.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.300]   So again, if they can do anything less than three,
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:47.560]   you're going to be a strength.
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.660]   In fact, if you want to look at muscular endurance in general
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.740]   so this is a bit of a off topic,
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:54.020]   but I promise I'll keep it short and I'll come right back.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.780]   When I was a doctoral student, I had two lab mates.
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.160]   One of them was a runner female, 120 pounds,
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.320]   something like that, small.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.280]   And the other one was a male.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.520]   And he was basically like a straight bro.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.120]   Like he lifts weights, doesn't do any other sort of training
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.840]   does like a very classic, not training program,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.880]   but kind of training.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.240]   And they were sort of bantering back and forth for a while.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.280]   And basically she was saying, you're so unfit,
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.120]   you can't run at all.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.000]   And he's saying, you're so weak, you can't do a pull up.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.580]   And so they challenged each other to a competition.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.560]   They said at the end of the year,
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.320]   the girl is going to do 26 pull ups
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.440]   and the guy had to run a marathon, so 26 miles.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.440]   So that was the thing.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.160]   And then there was some sort of consequence
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.240]   for whoever sort of failed it.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.320]   So the guy quickly tried to figure out
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.560]   how the hell am I gonna run 26 miles
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.580]   when I have not run a mile in like many, many, many years.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:42.760]   So he just started running, you know,
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.440]   three miles, four miles or whatever.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.920]   She, well of course they,
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.040]   both of them ran immediately to me, right?
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.520]   And then she was like, how the hell, I can't do a pull up.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.600]   And I was like, great.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.400]   And I gave her a very specific maximal strength protocol.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.280]   And she was like, whoa,
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.120]   I wanna go to the assisted pull up machine
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.920]   and work on doing like sets of 25,
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.080]   'cause I've got to get my muscular endurance up.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.040]   And I tried to explain to her,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.160]   your muscular endurance is irrelevant if you can't do one.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.640]   It's never going to matter.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.500]   She did the muscular endurance protocol, the entire thing,
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.340]   didn't listen to me.
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:12.400]   At the end of the year came,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.700]   she still produced exactly zero pull ups.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:19.760]   So point is, if you look at muscular endurance,
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.920]   where is it strength and where is it actually
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.760]   muscular endurance?
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.160]   The general sort of number that you're looking for
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.540]   is under like 80%, right?
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.380]   That's gonna tell you,
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.740]   is this a muscular endurance problem
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:31.160]   or is this an absolute strength problem?
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.760]   - Under 80% of a one repetition maximum.
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.400]   - Yep, so what I mean by that is this.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.300]   In fact, this actually leads into your question.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.000]   The other way to assess muscular endurance
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.700]   is take the exact strength test you did
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.840]   from the talk five minutes ago.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.000]   What, which one did you do?
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.180]   Load that to 75% and then do that
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.880]   for as many repetitions as you can.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.320]   And that is a tremendous barometer of muscular endurance.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.040]   So if you were able to do 200 pounds
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.000]   on your leg extension test,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.640]   put 75% on that and do that as many reps as you can.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.280]   You want to look for more than eight repetitions.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.460]   If you are below eight repetitions,
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:08.160]   then we have a muscular endurance problem, right?
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:12.140]   If it is higher than that, if you've got 15 or 20,
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.440]   then we know we have probably some problems
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.120]   in your peak strength or the test itself.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.400]   So that is a good eight to 12 sort of number
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.240]   is where you want to be looking at for there.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:26.440]   - What about anaerobic capacity?
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.140]   - This one's more challenging.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.360]   You either have to go to a laboratory
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.240]   and do something like a Wingate test.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.400]   So this is a 30 second maximal test
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:37.560]   where you're going to see how much work
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:41.360]   can you possibly do in that 30 seconds.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.480]   If you don't have a lab-assisted laboratory,
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.160]   you can do this on any protocol you want.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.520]   This could be sprinting, this can be on an air bike,
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.000]   this could be on a rower, anything like that.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.160]   Anything where you can exert maximal effort
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.400]   and you don't have to worry about technical problems.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.480]   So I generally don't like to do things
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.380]   like a kettlebell swing or something like that.
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.560]   There's just too many other variables.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.760]   You need to be able to go as hard as you possibly can
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.360]   knowing you're going to get to a place
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.840]   of tremendous fatigue.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.700]   Now in the lab, we often use what's called
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:14.140]   a Bosco protocol and you're going to stand
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.180]   on a force plate and you're going to do
[01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.540]   as many vertical jumps as fast as you can,
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.820]   as high as you can for 60 seconds
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.680]   and you're absolutely destroyed by like second 45.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.340]   So we either use that Wingate protocol
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.940]   or that Bosco protocol.
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:31.280]   If you want though, again, take any of those other places,
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.240]   30 seconds or so, up to 45 seconds,
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.920]   up to a minute if you want, it doesn't really matter,
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.500]   and you just mark down the distance you cover.
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.420]   That's all you're, we don't really have standards
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.420]   for these things because it's going to be different.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:45.980]   How far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:49.960]   is just going to be so different than sprinting in the field
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.080]   or on the assault bike or whatever.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.440]   So what you really want to worry about there
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.740]   is can you complete it?
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:59.620]   And then how awful do you feel afterwards?
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:02.960]   So what you really want to think about here
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.140]   is not those protocols, but this.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:08.260]   You want to think about can you get close
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:11.340]   to your predicted maximum heart rate?
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:16.060]   So the number we throw out is 220 minus your age.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.980]   So if you're 50 years old, 220 minus 50,
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:20.880]   you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.820]   of around 170 beats per minute.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:26.040]   Now, that number is extremely generic.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:26.980]   If you don't get there,
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.180]   that doesn't have any indication of your fitness.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.500]   If you get higher, that doesn't mean you're any more fit.
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:32.740]   It's just a rough number.
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.780]   So here's what I want you to do.
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:38.220]   In this case, your heart rate recovery is the better metric.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:41.280]   So I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.580]   and then test your heart rate recovery.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:45.060]   And what you should be looking for there
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:48.900]   is about half a beat recovery per second.
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.700]   So you're going to get up to a place
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:53.340]   where you reach absolute terrible exhaustion,
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:58.460]   maximum fatigue, test your heart rate,
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.620]   and then count, have a timer going.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:03.320]   Within 60 seconds, you should have, again,
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.020]   at half a beat per second,
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.580]   you should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute.
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:11.500]   Within the next minute, so two minute recovery,
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.140]   it should begin half that, so 60 beats.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:14.540]   Those are rough numbers to go by.
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:16.580]   And your three minute recovery is, again,
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:17.620]   half of that again.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.820]   So that is the closest way.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.000]   If your heart rate recovery is worse than that,
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.780]   then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.520]   or your cardiovascular capacity.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.420]   - I love it.
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.900]   What about number eight, maximal heart rate?
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:32.940]   Because what you just described
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.340]   sounds a lot like maximal heart rate.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.780]   - So this is your VO2 max.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.640]   So the gold standard here is to actually go
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.400]   into a laboratory and get this thing done.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.380]   So we can actually run a VO2 max test
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:44.260]   where you put a mask on, collect all your gases,
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:45.500]   and run you to there.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.840]   And there's a very specific protocol
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.460]   for completion of a true maximum test.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.860]   And any of the scientists will know that.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.420]   If you don't have access to that,
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.860]   you can do a couple of tests.
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:59.840]   One of them is called a 12 minute Cooper's test.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.860]   So this is simply time.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.860]   You're going to run for 12 minutes as far as you can,
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:04.780]   and you're going to record the distance you covered.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.200]   Again, you can go online to any number of calculators,
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.700]   enter that distance in,
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:14.160]   and that will tell you your estimated VO2 max.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.020]   - So that's a 12 minute sprint?
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:17.320]   - 12 minute sprint.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.840]   Maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.380]   - Keeping a steady pace the whole time?
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.120]   - Do whatever you want.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.740]   The goal is to get maximum distance covered in 12 minutes.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:30.620]   So that's anywhere between a mile to two plus miles,
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.020]   depending on how fit you are.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.860]   But you just do that Cooper 12 minute test.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.880]   - Got it.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:37.820]   - I told you.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:38.820]   All right, so if you remember,
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:41.220]   aerobic capacity is eight to 12 sort of minutes
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:44.340]   where you're going to see a real true test of that VO2 max.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.780]   You simply can't get that in under a few minutes.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.460]   So it is a, if you want,
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:55.180]   you can do a little gentler version of that.
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:57.780]   So there are a number of submaximal tests there.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:00.800]   In fact, there is a one mile walk test you can do.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.000]   So again, all you're going to do is in this case,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.720]   you have to have some sort of either a stopwatch
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.800]   or ideally a heart rate monitor.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.580]   And all you have to do is this is a Rockport one mile
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.420]   submaximal test.
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:14.000]   So you're going to walk a mile, record the time,
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.040]   record your heart rate at the end, enter those in,
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.660]   and those will give you, again, estimates of your VO2 max.
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:22.380]   So that's the like, oh my gosh,
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:25.380]   I can't run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can,
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:26.380]   or I don't want to do it.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:30.140]   Or we have a lot of these in our executive program.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.560]   It's like, my knee hurts too bad.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.160]   I've got back pain when I run or whatever.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.220]   Can I, okay.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.720]   And you do the walk test and it's pretty accurate
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.560]   if you do it correctly.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.940]   So technically, all you have to actually do
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:41.000]   is measure your heart rate on your, you know,
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.220]   and I can count 60 seconds,
[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:44.340]   but it's just easier to work with everyone's watches
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.820]   and stuff now, just wear the heart rate monitor,
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.640]   plug in those numbers.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.820]   And again, those are all standard calculations.
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:54.840]   So anywhere you find those,
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.040]   you don't have to worry about the source.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.140]   So you just enter your stuff in
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:59.360]   and they're going to be running off the same equation.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.680]   - I like the idea of the 12 minute run.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:02.800]   I'm going to give it a shot.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.160]   See what happens. - We did for years,
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:06.640]   we did a one mile version of this
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:08.360]   and there's just a lot more science
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:09.680]   on the 12 minute Cooper test.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.520]   So we did that.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.220]   It's pretty good.
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.640]   And it is not even remotely close to fun.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:18.800]   - It sounds like fun for other reasons.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.880]   - Yeah, yeah, well, it is.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.160]   - Fun in the sense that it reveals a lot.
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:24.700]   - Yep. - Powerful, potent.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.540]   - Super.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:28.720]   There's no hiding.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.480]   You can hide with a leg extension test.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.780]   It doesn't hurt that pad,
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:35.420]   but you cannot feel anything but the 12 minute run
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:36.480]   as far as you can test.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.720]   - So these are really actually psychiatric diagnostic tests.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.560]   - They are.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:42.960]   - Of sorts. - For sure.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.740]   - Number nine, long duration steady state exercise.
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.420]   I think of this as AKA endurance,
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.940]   but as you mentioned before,
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:53.200]   there are other forms of endurance.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.000]   So long duration steady state exercise.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.360]   - Yep, so you really wanna think about this
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.920]   as not a standard number.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.680]   This is you should maintain consistent work output
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.920]   for over 20 plus minutes.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.720]   Okay, and this one, I want you to just pick something
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.100]   that it was in your lifestyle.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.260]   So is there a loop around your house that you can do?
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:18.760]   Is there some protocol that you like to use before?
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.720]   And you're simply going to test your ability.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.040]   Can you maintain work without stopping?
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.240]   That's all it needs to be.
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:26.560]   Now, ideally, I personally like
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.540]   to throw a little twist in here,
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:30.240]   which is can you do this with nasal breathing only?
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.300]   That's when I feel really good.
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:32.600]   If you can go 30 straight minutes
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.400]   without needing to take a break,
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.740]   walking doesn't really cut it
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.760]   unless you're very, very unfit.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.440]   In which case, if walking 30 minutes without a break
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:43.440]   is a challenge, okay, like there.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.400]   But if you can, I want you moving at a non-walking pace.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.920]   I don't care what zone this is,
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.240]   two, three, four, five, I don't care.
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.040]   Show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:57.300]   of work with no breaks, no intervals, no downtime.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:00.360]   And again, ideally breathing through your nose only.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.720]   - I love this list, but it worries me a bit.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.640]   Not because any one of these tests
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.260]   is necessarily that overwhelming,
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:13.080]   but because I'm unclear about how to arrange performance
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.720]   of these different tests.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.700]   For instance, do I separate them?
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.440]   So I'm doing one test like long duration output on one day
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.000]   and I'm doing strength on another day.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.840]   Those seem pretty obvious to me,
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.440]   but are there ones that one can combine on different days?
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.120]   How much time should one give oneself
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.320]   in between these tests
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.400]   and how often should one do an assessment?
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.160]   Just as we don't want to necessarily
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.560]   evaluate body weight changes
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.300]   by getting on the scale three times a day,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:40.040]   maybe once a day at the same time,
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.560]   each day is more practical.
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.220]   How often should we be assessing our fitness
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.400]   for each and every one of these?
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.000]   - Well, the way that I would say this is
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.880]   you want to pick the one that is the worst
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.520]   and do that more frequently.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.880]   So if, for example, you do the upper body strength test
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.260]   and you are fantastic,
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:00.600]   if you can bench press double your body weight,
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:04.000]   I don't need to test your bench very often
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.280]   for the average person.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.480]   You're not a power lifter, maybe once a year or so,
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.480]   maybe not even that.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.840]   We just don't need to get there.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.000]   However, if we then test your VO2 max
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.680]   and in your 12 minutes you cover a total of a half a mile,
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:20.120]   then we might want to test that every month.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.920]   And so we're going to let our priorities emphasize
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.600]   which one we're going to do more often.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:27.520]   I would recommend doing this full battery once a year.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.640]   - Full battery mean the entire list on one day?
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.280]   - The entire, no, not on one day, but within a week.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.120]   So you could take a week.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.980]   Now you could do these technically all in two days.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:38.180]   Three day split here is probably best.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:40.440]   So if you were to just say, hey, this is like testing week.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.120]   I actually love this for beginning of the year
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.120]   or whenever it is that you sort of change your training.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.460]   But I think once a year, just like once a year,
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:49.840]   you should probably go to a physician
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.600]   and get full blood work, a full heart scan
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.840]   and everything like that.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:58.340]   And then if maybe you had a heart issue,
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.280]   they would come back and test you more frequently,
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.240]   whatever the case is, right?
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.380]   You should probably run through this.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.320]   And you're going to be thinking, yeah,
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.440]   but I don't want to like give up
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.760]   on my exercise routine that week.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.080]   Well, I promise you you're not going to finish this week
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.840]   and think I didn't do very much work this week.
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:12.820]   It's going to feel great.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:15.220]   And then you're going to have a very nice barometer
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.840]   of exactly where you need to change
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.240]   and prioritize your training for the next quarter
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.440]   or half a year or wherever you want to go.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.140]   If you want to actually do this every six months,
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.280]   that's really, we end up actually doing this
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:27.280]   quite honestly like more like every six months
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.880]   as a general test.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.000]   That's a really good way to do it.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.280]   But if minimum of, if you're arguing with me,
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.000]   give me once a year you want to do this.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.540]   So which order to do them in?
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:40.080]   The non fatiguing tests you can do whenever.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.520]   So this is the body composition scan,
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.320]   the FFMI, the body fat composition,
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.320]   all this stuff can be done wherever.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.360]   I generally like to do that though
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.120]   as your very first activity.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.520]   The reason is we know that acute exercise
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.760]   can heavily influence things
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.040]   like body composition measurements
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.860]   because of inflammation, water storage, et cetera.
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.640]   So it's easiest to just sort of get that
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:02.200]   off of a 48 hour rest.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.640]   You want to make sure you don't do any hard exercise
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.240]   the day before a body composition test
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:08.600]   and probably 48 hours before that.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.880]   So just start yourself off with that.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.180]   Your movement test can be the same thing.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.480]   You don't want to try to do a assessment
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.360]   of how well you're squatting
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:20.060]   if you're incredibly sore from your brutal squatting test.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.480]   So tend to do those things when you're the most fresh.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.640]   Then what you want to do is any skill
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.000]   or maximum strength or power
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.120]   goes at the very beginning of the day.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.640]   Any fatiguing thing happens at the end.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.740]   And so you could easily do this.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:37.820]   All right, I'm going to do my power test, my broad jump.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:41.280]   Great, you're not going to be fatigued at all from that.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.800]   And on the same day, since I'm already pretty warmed up,
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.720]   now I'm going to roll right into my leg strength test.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:48.960]   And since I'm really warmed up,
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.220]   I'm going to do my leg muscular endurance test right there.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:53.920]   So this is a very common strategy we use.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.520]   We do our one rep max leg extension,
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.580]   five minutes, seven minutes, whatever we need to do.
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:02.320]   Come back, load it to 75%, do as many reps as you can.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.160]   Boom.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.180]   You could roll right into then your upper body test
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:06.900]   or your grip strength test or anything else
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.160]   that you want to do there.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.200]   Is there a little bit of influence?
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.440]   Yeah, but really for most people, it's not that bad.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.200]   What influence I mean, if you do a leg strength test,
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.120]   coming back and doing that upper body strength test
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.560]   afterwards, it's not that big a deal.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.360]   Give yourself 15, give yourself 20 minutes.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.920]   Give it plenty of time.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.360]   So you can knock out your strength testing
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.640]   and muscular endurance testing all in one day.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.360]   That could be, you could do your performance,
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.560]   your skill diagnostic, your power jump test,
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.280]   your strength and your muscular endurance
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.060]   and all that stuff is knocked out.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:42.340]   You're gonna have to come back on a separate day
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:44.080]   and do your anaerobic test.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.500]   This is 30 seconds maximum endurance, things like that.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.280]   You could though, if you wanted,
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.440]   do that after your long duration tests.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:53.620]   Your long duration test is again,
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.960]   is just gonna function as like a big warmup
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.920]   or you could flip those things
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.740]   or you could do them on separate days.
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:02.760]   You're gonna have to do your VO2 max test
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.480]   on its own day for the most part,
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.640]   unless you wanted to do again your movement
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.580]   or your body composition sort of before those things.
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:12.400]   So you really have the ability to kind of mix and match.
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.040]   Ideally, this most realistically probably takes three days.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:18.560]   If you wanna separate them into four or five,
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.740]   the more separation you do,
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.800]   the better data you're gonna get.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.720]   It's just a question of like,
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:25.260]   how pedantic are you really trying to get here?
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:29.760]   And are you willing to lose 5% to then save a whole day?
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.940]   Then you can do sort of these things in multiple stacks.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:34.040]   So that's how I would break it up.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.480]   - So what I'm hearing is better to do it than to not do it.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.360]   - Most definitely.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.800]   - And be rational, don't try and do your strength output
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.080]   late in the day when you're fatigued.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:48.040]   If you're gonna combine some of the steady state endurance
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.580]   and maximal heart rate, fine.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.620]   Understand there might be a slight deficit there,
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.500]   but test it the same way each time
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.460]   and what you're really looking for is improvement.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.880]   - Yep, and you could also do the heart rate recovery
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.760]   under any of the modalities.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.620]   So you could do the heart rate recovery
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:03.320]   after your VO2 max as well.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.860]   So you finish that thing and then just again,
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:08.900]   do the same test for up to three minutes.
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:10.160]   - These are fantastic tools.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.520]   I'm almost tempted to say
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:12.860]   that I'm willing to post my numbers,
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:15.580]   but that actually violates the core principle
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:16.560]   that I think we're getting at here,
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.300]   which is that it's highly unlikely
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:22.400]   that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.800]   I mean, certainly there will be individuals that are,
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.060]   but based on everything we talked about earlier,
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:30.420]   specificity of training and how extensively
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:32.360]   somebody's been training a certain way will,
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.660]   without question, lopside them, if you will,
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:39.480]   toward being better in some of these assessments
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:41.200]   and less good in others.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.780]   And that's just simply the way that these adaptations work.
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:47.440]   - Yep, and it's not, you don't need to be optimal
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.040]   in all of these areas to be quote unquote "optimal health"
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:52.240]   from this perspective.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.340]   You just want to make sure, again,
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:56.640]   there's no severe performance anchors.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.880]   This is what we call them, right?
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.760]   We don't want any of these severe constraints
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:03.120]   'cause you're going to get limited by that thing.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.220]   And so what you want to do is move that up
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:09.220]   to just sufficient or concerning and get it away from that.
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:11.440]   If you do that, that thing's not going to catch you.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.000]   You're going to be able to continue to pursue optimization
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.440]   in any of the one things that you have
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.240]   a specific passion for,
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.000]   which is generally what moves people, right?
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.080]   You train so that you feel better.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.360]   You train because you know there are all these benefits to it
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.120]   and, geez, this audience probably
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.360]   could list hundreds of them.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.040]   But you also train because you generally
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.400]   like to get better at something.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.760]   A lot of us have something.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.240]   And so you want to make sure that you're not going,
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:38.140]   "Hey, I know you're good at endurance,
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:39.600]   "but you really shouldn't train anymore."
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.320]   We don't want that message, not at all.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.840]   I want you to love your training.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.960]   We just want to make sure that you're not loving that so much
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:48.560]   that you're not taking some blinders off
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:51.340]   and missing another area which would actually,
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:53.940]   again, you pull that performance anchor,
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:56.040]   this whole ship sails faster
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.340]   with less effort and less friction.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.980]   - What I love about this is also that,
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:04.660]   as you've described it, it's not just for athletes
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.540]   or people that are super into fitness.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:09.020]   It's also for people that just want to be healthy
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.300]   and want aesthetic changes,
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.540]   and that's why they're exercising,
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.900]   which I think accounts for a really large percentage
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.020]   of people out there.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:19.420]   So I think what you described is incredibly well-structured,
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:22.400]   incredibly clear, and incredibly actionable.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.740]   So I want to thank you for that.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:29.340]   I'm serious about my willingness to do this
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.660]   and at least share those numbers with you.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:34.980]   And I think for most people that are seeking
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:36.180]   what you listed off before,
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:39.260]   aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity,
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:42.220]   it's clear that all nine of these are going to be important
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.740]   in some regard or another.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:44.720]   - So before we close out,
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:48.780]   I want to go back and finish off the metrics for VO2 Max
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.220]   'cause I don't actually think I gave you numbers on that.
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.860]   So in general, for men,
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:56.100]   a minimum number we want to look at here is 35 milliliters
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.020]   per kilogram per minute.
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.460]   And for women, that'd be about 30.
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:02.840]   So we can actually push a lot higher on those things.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.700]   In reality, I want to see men above 50.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:08.060]   - If I could just interrupt you for a second.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:11.340]   When you say 40 milliliters per kilogram,
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:14.280]   milliliters of what specifically?
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.500]   - Yeah, so what actually those metrics mean is,
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.620]   the first one, milliliters, is oxygen.
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:20.020]   So it's amount of oxygen.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.340]   Kilograms is body weight.
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.420]   So it's how much oxygen can you bring in
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:27.260]   per kilogram of body weight per minute?
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:30.420]   So it is a volume of oxygen per your size
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.020]   in a time duration.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.500]   In fact, the way that you calculate it
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:37.020]   is you multiply your cardiac output
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:38.680]   by what's called your AVO2 difference.
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:40.660]   Your cardiac output is your heart rate
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:41.740]   times your stroke volume.
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.780]   So how much blood you're pumping out per pump
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:45.720]   is your stroke volume.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:48.860]   How many times you're pumping or you're beating,
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.740]   you multiply that by your AVO2 difference.
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:54.340]   AVO2 difference is artery minus vein difference.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:56.420]   So it's the amount of oxygen in your arteries
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.520]   minus the amount of oxygen in your vein,
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.460]   which is going to tell you how much you took up
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:02.020]   in your capillaries in your muscles.
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.220]   So you take those two factors, multiply them together,
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.620]   and there's your VO2 max.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:06.940]   - You know, as you were describing that,
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:09.140]   I imagine you getting to an fMRI machine
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:12.100]   and seeing that equation lighting up in your brain,
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:14.520]   because clearly it's committed to memory very well.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.260]   Thank you for that clear description.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.320]   - Yep, so to finish those numbers,
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:21.760]   I really truly want to see a man above 50,
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.760]   and I'm not even really stoked until I get above 55.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:27.440]   In fact, it's sort of funny, Dave Costell,
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.880]   whose lab I did my PhD in, he was retired by the time,
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.200]   but he's, again, one of these legendary figures
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.040]   in exercise physiology, started in the '70s.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.200]   He would always say, "There's no human excuse
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.120]   "to be below 60," which I was always like,
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:42.720]   "Damn, that's really actually pretty hard to get to."
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.080]   - Was he at 60 or above? - Oh, yeah.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.280]   He's still actually setting world records
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.480]   in these last couple of years,
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.080]   in his, like all the master's records for swimming
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.560]   and cycling and stuff.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:55.280]   So he was a super, super fit guy.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.720]   So he was always above 60.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.940]   He's probably like 50-something now,
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.840]   even though he's 80 or whatever.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.240]   - 80 years old. - Yeah.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.640]   - With a VO2 max of 50.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.720]   - He's probably really not 50.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:07.040]   He's probably, but he's probably going to,
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:09.720]   remember that earlier in the, we talked about
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.320]   how I had the 92-year-old via the VO2 max of 38.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.960]   Dave's probably gonna break that record
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.560]   when he gets there, I'm sure.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.640]   In fact, I guarantee you he has that number in his brain.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.280]   I haven't talked to him in 15 years,
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.440]   but I guarantee you that number is in his brain,
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.840]   and he's probably training for it.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.680]   - I love it.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.060]   And I love it because it proves that exercise pays off.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:30.400]   - Oh, yeah. - It's one of the few things
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.560]   in life where there's a direct relationship
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:34.640]   between work and outcome.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.240]   - Yeah, that's, as Henry Rollins described
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:40.320]   in his wonderful essay, if you're familiar with that.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.920]   Oh my gosh, you're a punk rock guy.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:42.840]   You know Henry, I'm sure.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:44.600]   - I mean, I certainly know who he is,
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.320]   and I know his work. - Yeah, he has
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.200]   an incredible one-page paper,
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.320]   sort of something to do with the iron,
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:52.820]   and he basically describes that as like,
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:55.760]   this is the one thing where it's truth.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:58.240]   Like, it is the most true thing you'll ever do,
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.320]   which is, I love for that.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.000]   - It's almost like a principle of nature.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.360]   - 100%, yeah.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.280]   So with the women, I really want to see the women.
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:08.760]   If I want to see men above 55,
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.840]   I really want to see women above 50 as the target,
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.440]   and it'd be like, you're there, I'm pretty good.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.500]   So you can do the math on then the middle ground
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.220]   of what's like, okay, but we need to work on it.
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.820]   In fact, if you look across the literature
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.760]   at different athletes, you're gonna see like
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:26.500]   the really high level endurance folks.
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.320]   You know, they may pass 70 or 80.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.880]   In fact, there was talk a few years ago
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:34.480]   of a guy breaking 100, as like an 18 or 19 year old,
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.880]   but I actually don't think it was ever
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.060]   fully confirmed or repeated,
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.440]   but certainly you'll see plenty of people
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.160]   like 95 in those extremes.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:45.720]   If you look at other sports like football or basketball,
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.840]   they're probably going to be in the 55, 65 sort of range.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.660]   So if you as an average person are 55,
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:53.720]   that's a really good marker to be in.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:56.200]   If you get even close to that, you're in a good spot.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:58.480]   I'm sorry if I let you down, Dave.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:00.800]   - I just love how, as you're describing this average person,
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.440]   you're looking at me with just a little bit of sympathy.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.260]   Like if you reach the standard of average, Andrew,
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:08.640]   listen, you're giving me prompts all over the place
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.620]   to try and improve my metrics, whatever they happen to be.
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:13.580]   And I think that's one of the great values
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.620]   of getting objective numbers,
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:16.800]   even if they have to be measured
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:19.340]   by some of these back of the envelope techniques
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:24.220]   that I guess we always teach people in the laboratory, right?
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:28.500]   That a tool can be not extremely precise,
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:31.700]   but as long as it's reliable, there is still value there.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.860]   I mean, of course you'd love to have the most precise
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:36.400]   and most reliable tool, but if you can't,
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.380]   then at least go for a reliable tool
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:40.340]   and measure for consistency.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.380]   Yet for the real world, reliability beats validity
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:44.220]   as much as we can.
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:45.300]   For a lot of things we're talking about,
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.160]   especially if we're using it as a metric of,
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.420]   did I get better?
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.980]   As long as that tool is reliable, body composition,
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:54.140]   just all of these things have inherent error in them.
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:56.220]   Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger,
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:58.060]   but as you mentioned, having standardization
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:00.860]   within the testing protocol is gonna allow you
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:02.460]   to measure progress and that's gonna tell you
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:04.460]   sort of where you're at.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:07.840]   Now that we sort of covered all these areas of adaptation,
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:10.020]   we walked through the history and we walked through
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:12.620]   a bunch of the explanations for why people
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:13.820]   are maybe not getting the results
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:16.420]   that they wanna get through their training.
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.780]   The way I would like to go with the rest
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.100]   of our conversations would be to just go through
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:21.660]   each of those adaptations step by step
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:24.100]   and make sure I cover very specific protocols
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.420]   for if you have run through this testing
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:28.160]   and identified an area of weakness.
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:30.540]   So maybe you've sort of been lifting a lot
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:33.400]   'cause you like lifting and you maybe realize
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.580]   that your cardiovascular fitness or your heart rate recovery
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:37.160]   is not where it really should be.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.740]   Or the opposite, like we've talked about.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:41.060]   Maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:42.160]   and your strength isn't there,
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.840]   your movement quality is not there.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.040]   So you've identified a problem.
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:47.900]   How do I specifically solve it?
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:52.460]   What are the evidence-based and most effective protocols
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:54.820]   that I could put myself in for each one of these categories?
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:59.300]   And I think that would give people a lot of take-home value,
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:00.680]   but it's gonna take us some time to cover.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:02.460]   So it's gonna have to come across
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.140]   over multiple conversations between you and I.
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:06.680]   - Great, well, I'm looking forward to each
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.580]   and all of those conversations.
[01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:12.220]   And I want to add just one more metric
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:13.700]   to our discussion today,
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:16.740]   which is really just my way of saying thank you,
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:18.420]   because if there were a metric
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.420]   for amount of useful information per sentence spoke,
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:26.460]   you would be at the upper level of that metric.
[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:30.860]   You have this amazing ability to provide so much knowledge
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:34.980]   in a clear and concise and today listed out format
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:38.460]   that is both interesting, grounded in science,
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:39.380]   and actionable.
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:41.940]   So on behalf of everyone listening,
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:43.700]   and certainly for myself as well,
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.180]   I just want to say thank you.
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:46.660]   - Well, I appreciate the compliments,
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:49.900]   and I'm looking forward to the next conversation,
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:53.260]   jumping right into speed, strength, and hypertrophy training,
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:56.060]   and what are the evidence-based and best practices
[01:59:56.060 --> 01:59:57.860]   for protocols in those areas.
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:00.220]   - If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,
