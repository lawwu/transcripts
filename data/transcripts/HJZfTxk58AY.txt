[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   This is like one of what I would consider the most significant lies we've all been told.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000]   I spend a lot of time thinking about problems.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.660]   Paradoxes contain a lot of that.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.240]   When you think about something that looks on the surface one way,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.700]   but in reality, it's another way, that's fundamentally what we're talking about here.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.800]   It's not about coming up with the right answer.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.660]   It's about asking the right question and about struggling with it
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.740]   slightly better than you were previously.
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.800]   The advice paradox is the idea that we all get and receive a whole lot of advice.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.200]   Most of it is complete garbage.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.960]   So what you're left with is a worse idea of what the overall answer is.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.740]   And so the real key then is let's talk about the opportunity paradox.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.200]   The idea here with the opportunity paradox is you need to take on less to accomplish more.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.000]   If you had to accomplish your 10-year goals in the next six months,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560]   what would you do and how would you do it?
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.000]   Zaho, thanks for being here.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500]   Glad to be back and in the new home studio even better.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.060]   I know, we're building the sauna out front and the construction has been paused for two hours for us to record.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.300]   Next time I come here, I expect to do a sauna episode, though.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.360]   - Yeah, it's... - Sauna cold plunge?
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240]   Yeah, one, two.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.900]   Yeah, the company building the sauna, everyone will hear about it later.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600]   - It's called Haven Saunas. - Okay.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.960]   And it's going to be really nice.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.240]   - Yeah. - They're doing really great work.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.840]   But next time we'll do it.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.700]   It's always trouble to narrow down the scope of these conversations
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.340]   because you've written about so much and I'm an avid reader of yours.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.600]   But I was thinking about the topic today and I thought,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.400]   there is one topic that you've written about on Twitter
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   that has actually led to tremendous amazement of a lunch with a billionaire.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.740]   So maybe we just start with what is that topic and why should we talk about it?
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.340]   So I think what you're alluding to, because it's the only one, is the topic of paradoxes.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.340]   And the funny story around all of this and the lunch with the billionaire story
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.140]   goes back to, let's see, November of 2021, I wrote my first...
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.240]   This was like a Twitter thread on the topic of paradoxes.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.840]   So basically, a paradox is like a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.140]   that once you actually dig into it and investigate it, may actually prove true.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.240]   I wrote a sort of curation of like 20 of my favorite paradoxes
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.000]   that I feel like I've come across in my own life
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.340]   or that I've struggled with on a regular basis and shared it.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.840]   And it went pretty viral at the time, probably had like 60 or so thousand likes,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.240]   reached tons of people, etc. Went away.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.140]   Just like most things do on Twitter, it's kind of an ephemeral platform.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.340]   Once something has buzzed for 24 hours, it sort of disappears into the ether and it's gone forever.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.500]   So fast forward to January 2023, I am in India visiting my grandmother.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.540]   And I wake up in the morning to a bunch of texts from friends saying like,
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.140]   "Whoa, Bill Ackman shared your tweet thread."
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.240]   So I expect like, "Oh, it's some recent thing that I've written. That's cool."
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.340]   I pop it open and I look, and he has quote tweeted this thread from November 2021,
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.140]   saying, "A friend sent me this last week. It contains tons of wisdom. Everyone should read it."
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.940]   And so I'm like, you know, I'm the big like shoot your shot guy.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.240]   I talk about that a lot. Closed mouths don't get fed is like one of my mantras on life.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.540]   So I reply to his tweet and say, you know, "Thanks for sharing my work, Bill.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.240]   We should get lunch in New York sometime on me."
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.940]   You know, kind of tongue-in-cheek like he's a billionaire. I'm obviously not. I'll pay for lunch.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.040]   And he replies and says, "Would love to do that."
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.440]   And so we DM, coordinate, and I end up getting to have lunch with Bill Ackman
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   as a result of this Twitter thread that I had written 18 months before, whatever it was.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.140]   Unbelievable serendipity and also a perfect example of like the luck raiser,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.840]   which I feel like we talked about on our last episode of expanding your luck surface area
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.640]   and how content is a great, great example of that.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.040]   You put something out into the world and it's still creating lucky encounters for you 18 months into the future.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   Yeah, so I can't promise that anyone listening is going to be able to use this content
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.340]   to have lunch with a billionaire, but...
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.940]   Maybe.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.240]   Maybe, but I can promise that the value you get from it's tremendous because I've gotten it.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.240]   So what I thought we'd do, similar to the last time when we talked about raisers,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.540]   was just kind of run through what I thought were some of my favorites.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.840]   If I miss some, you can bring them up and I've kind of grouped them into a few categories.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.540]   And so maybe talk really briefly why paradoxes, what attracted you to write about this?
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.440]   You kind of defined it briefly, but...
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.340]   Like for me, when I think about content more broadly and the content that I create,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.140]   my whole goal is not to provide answers to questions for people.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.640]   You know, I don't sit down and think that I am some unbelievably wise or intelligent person
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.440]   that has all the answers to how to live your life in a better way.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.140]   What I do know is that I spend a lot of time thinking about problems
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.140]   and thinking about struggles that I've encountered in my own life
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.840]   and about tensions and balance points and all these different areas.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.840]   Paradoxes contain a lot of that.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.640]   Like when you think about, you know, something that looks on the surface one way,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.240]   but in reality, it's another way, that's fundamentally what we're talking about here.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   And that's life.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.740]   And so I thought the paradoxes piece and my writing on it was like a great encapsulation
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.540]   of how you actually encounter challenges and struggle in your own life.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.340]   It's not about like coming up with the right answer.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.240]   It's about asking the right question and about struggling with it
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.640]   slightly better than you were previously.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.440]   And so that's like, that's always been my attempt with writing about it
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.140]   and hopefully what has come across and why it's resonated with people when I have.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.140]   It's funny, I think when you just started saying that,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.940]   it made me click why I appreciate your content so much.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.840]   What I do is actually probably the exact opposite.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.240]   I'm like, I am going to do all the research on all the cell phone plans in the country
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.840]   to except for Xfinity Mobile, which a few of you have reached out and said,
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.640]   sorry, I left it off the list.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   I guess that my hatred of Comcast kind of came to fruition with the goal of like,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.940]   can I narrow down all the information so you can actually just make a decision?
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.840]   And I think your style of content is like,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   let me give you a bunch of information that you can use to think differently
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.640]   and maybe mine is that you can use to do differently.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.540]   I mean your content, there's sort of like two areas, right?
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.740]   Like your content is answerable.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.540]   Like there is a specific answer that you can research
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.340]   and give someone the best answer to definitively the type of questions you're wrestling with.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.240]   The questions I'm wrestling with are like how to live your life better
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.740]   or you know, like how to live in a slightly healthier or wealthier way
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.340]   and there's no one-size-fits-all to that.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.740]   I can research it all I want.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.640]   You know, I can go talk to like 90-year-olds, 80-year-olds, like learn all that I can,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.440]   but the reality is that everyone's life situation is different.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   Everyone's in a different season of their own life
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.540]   and so what the correct answer for you at age 20 when you're starting out
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.640]   is not the correct answer for you at age 40 or may not be
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.440]   and so my whole perspective is like I always need to navigate
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.340]   and avoid being like overly definitive and providing an answer
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.540]   and you know, reconcile the fact that I'm 32.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.840]   Like I don't have all the answers.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.040]   I'm not, you know, like a 95-year-old old wise monk living in the mountains of the Himalayas
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.740]   telling you that I've like learned the secret to life.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.940]   What I do know is that I spend a whole lot of time thinking about these things
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.540]   and that I have a way where I can sort of disseminate them,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.840]   you know, and hopefully like a clear and concise way
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.640]   that helps people navigate them in their own lives.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.440]   Yeah, so at the risk of taking too much advice,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   let's jump into the paradoxes.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.940]   Let's talk about the advice paradox because good transition.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.640]   Yeah, I feel like advice isn't what it might seem.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.140]   Yeah, I mean the advice paradox is the idea that,
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.640]   you know, we all get and receive a whole lot of advice over the course of our lives.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.540]   Most of it is complete garbage
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.740]   and the more advice you take, the less well-informed you actually are
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.640]   and this is something that's counterintuitive.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.640]   You think like, oh, I'm just starting out in my life.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.240]   I need to go and get tons of advice from all these different people
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.240]   and the reality is that for them, most of their maps
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.840]   that they're going to provide you with, the advice that they provide you being the map,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.540]   are not going to match the terrain of your life.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.140]   Your life is fundamentally very different than whatever it is you're going to encounter.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.140]   Nassim Taleb talks about this idea of like the noise bottleneck in some of his work,
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.840]   which basically says that you assume that by consuming more,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.740]   you're going to get more signal as a result,
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.340]   but the reality is that by consuming more and in this case consuming more advice,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.640]   the ratio of noise to signal actually increases over time
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   and so what you're left with is a worse idea of what the overall answer is
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.340]   and I really feel that way with advice.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.940]   When you go out and get too much advice, you get too many different perspectives,
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.440]   you actually leave feeling like, oh my God, I'm completely overwhelmed
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.140]   and I have no idea what the answer is to this problem
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.440]   and so the real key then is figuring out how to take some of the signal
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.240]   from what you get out in the world,
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.840]   sort of like narrow down to the things that are really high signal
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   and the people that are really providing, you know, the tightest and crispest,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.340]   crispest if that's a word, advice and leave all the noise,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.540]   you know, get rid of all that other noise that might exist in the world.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.940]   So is it more about seeking less advice
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.940]   or more about when you seek that advice knowing how to process what you learn?
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.840]   I think it's both.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.040]   I think on the seeking less advice,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.740]   that really comes from curating who you seek out for advice.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.340]   Seeking advice from people who have really experienced
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.940]   the thing that you are going through
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.440]   or have navigated in the way that you want to navigate it
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.540]   and narrowing it down to just those people is really important
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.640]   and then realizing that no one has the ultimate answer for you.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.740]   Like, you know, if I want to go start a business,
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.140]   I can't just go to Elon Musk and assume
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.640]   that he's going to have the perfect advice for me in my career where I am, right?
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.440]   Because survivorship bias plays a role, you know,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.640]   like he might have just gotten lucky
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.040]   and he and you are very different people.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   Yeah, and you know, very, very different people
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.640]   and want different things and have different balance points in our life
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.840]   and there's so many differences
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.940]   and yet most people when they go to do that,
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.040]   they go read a bunch of books on business
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.740]   and say like, oh, well, you know,
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.240]   Elon Musk bet it all after he sold his,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.640]   you know, shares in PayPal
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.540]   and put it like pushed all the chips back in the table
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.240]   and it worked out for him.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.340]   Now, he's the richest man in the world.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.840]   So I'm going to just keep betting it all
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.740]   and then you go bankrupt and you wonder why.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.140]   So, you know, survivorship bias plays a real role
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.640]   in how advice is given.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.740]   Like we take advice from the victors
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.440]   and that's a dangerous thing too.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.940]   Yeah, it's funny because we're both working on books
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.840]   and mine is kind of at the highest level principles for better outcomes
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   and the first one is that conventional wisdom sucks
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.040]   and I think when I think about the advice paradox,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.940]   I think about conventional wisdom
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.240]   and I think the most common piece of conventional wisdom
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.440]   that I hear so many people talk about when it comes to money and wealth
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.040]   is that real estate is the best way to build wealth.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.240]   I'm sure you've heard this.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.340]   Maybe people in your family believe it
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.140]   and for me, it's like it is a way
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.040]   and it happened to have worked for someone
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.240]   and then they translate that it to being the best
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   but who knows if they actually did the research ahead of time
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.340]   to pick that, you know, consciously
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.340]   or if it's just the thing that worked.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.540]   Yeah, conventional wisdom is an interesting thing.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.340]   It's sort of like all of these like,
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.140]   have you heard of Chesterton's fence?
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:19.140]   Like this idea that if you don't know why a fence is there,
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.740]   you should figure out why it's there before tearing it down.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.340]   I think about that a lot with things like this
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.240]   because so like the example is like
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.640]   if there's this fence and you think it's really stupid
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.840]   that it's there and you go tear it down
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.440]   because you can't figure out why it's there.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.140]   It might have been that it was holding back a whole bunch of wolves
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.640]   that you didn't know existed
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.040]   because the fence was holding it back
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.040]   and then you go tear it down
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.640]   and your whole town gets eaten by a bunch of wolves that are let in
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   and so like with stuff like this, like with conventional wisdom,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.640]   I just always seek to figure out,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.840]   okay, why is it there?
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.940]   Like before saying that it doesn't work
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.240]   or that it's incorrect,
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   I want to know like,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.840]   well, what created the situation
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   where that became conventional wisdom?
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.140]   So like before you dispel the notion,
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.140]   figure out why
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.540]   and then it might be that it was incorrect.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.840]   You know, like with Chesterton's fence,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.540]   the whole idea is like no one puts up a fence
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.840]   just for the fun of it.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.240]   So they put it up for a reason.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   You need to figure out why before you go and tear it down.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.740]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.340]   I chose conventional wisdom sucks.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.040]   Not conventional wisdom is wrong intentionally
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.540]   because I'm like,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.240]   it just sucks that people often give it
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.340]   as if it should apply to everyone.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.240]   It's not that it's wrong.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.540]   It's just that you might not be in the same situation
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.040]   as your parents were
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.540]   and so their advice might not apply.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.940]   And most people blindly give it
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.440]   because it's repeated ad nauseum
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.240]   and so most people will continue to perpetuate
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.640]   whatever the conventional wisdom is
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.040]   because it's easy to do
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.840]   without actually having thought about it
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.440]   on a first principles basis.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.640]   And so when you ask them like,
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.240]   well, why?
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.640]   Why should I own real estate
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.340]   and they go to start explaining it.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.640]   It's like the Emperor has no clothes.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.840]   There's nothing underneath the surface of that question
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.940]   when you ask them.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.440]   Okay, so we're in the topic of life.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.340]   Let's talk about the opportunity paradox,
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.040]   which funny enough as I read through
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.840]   you've written about paradoxes multiple times
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.540]   used to be called the say no paradox has evolved.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.640]   Yeah, it's the evolution of a problem of my writing
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.140]   because I think the opportunity paradox
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.940]   has a better ring to it than say no.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.240]   The idea here with the opportunity paradox
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.740]   is you need to take on less to accomplish more.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.140]   So when I was young
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.240]   and probably when you were young
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.640]   probably a lot of your listeners
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.240]   you assume that you need to just take on
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.440]   every single thing
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.040]   if you want to accomplish great things.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.440]   You need to just say yes to things
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.840]   over and over and over again.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.240]   I think that is true to an extent early in your life
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.840]   because saying yes expands your luck surface area.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.540]   You get exposed to different things out there.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.840]   But at a certain point
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.740]   what you really need to do is take on less
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.140]   and you need to take on less but better
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.840]   to use the Greg McKeon thing from essentialism.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.940]   And this is like a really core trait
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.240]   of how you actually go deeper,
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.140]   how you identify
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.940]   what are those asymmetric opportunities that exist
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.740]   and how you pursue those only.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.740]   It almost reminds me there's another paradox.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.740]   You have the boredom paradox,
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.640]   which I kind of feel like might fit into
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.740]   if you have extra time
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.340]   because you haven't filled your day.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.440]   Would you say that these kind of pair well?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.740]   Yeah, I think like around all of these
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.440]   it's sort of free time is a good thing.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.140]   This is like one of what I would consider
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.240]   the most significant lies we've all been told
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.940]   which is that free time is bad.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.140]   The reality in my mind is that free time
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.640]   is a call option on future interesting opportunities.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.540]   What I mean by that
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.640]   is that when you have free time in your schedule
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.840]   you have the headspace
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.040]   and you have the actual time and bandwidth
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.340]   to go pursue the really high upside
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.740]   asymmetric opportunities that come into your life.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.340]   If your day is just back-to-back meetings
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.740]   chock full from start to finish,
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.440]   where are you going to pursue the interesting thing
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.240]   that might come your way?
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.440]   You're just going to have to say no to it
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.240]   because you literally don't have time
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.840]   and you don't have the headspace to think about it.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   I think about that all the time.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.040]   When I'm stressed
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   because I'm running from thing to thing to thing
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.340]   my response when I see a text or an email
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.740]   that might offer me something
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.040]   or ask me to do something
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.240]   is like default no
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.340]   because I'm overwhelmed.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.440]   I'm stressed and I just want to get things out of the way.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.040]   So creating that
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.740]   like Arthur Brooks calls it
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.340]   like ventilating your schedule
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.640]   like breathing some air into your schedule
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.440]   is a great way to spark creativity
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.440]   so that you can actually go and identify
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.740]   what those asymmetric opportunities are.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   The things where
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.140]   you know one unit of input
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.640]   is creating 10, 100, 1000x units of output.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.540]   Yeah, and if you don't have a thing
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.140]   to come back to boredom
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.040]   it's like actually being bored can be valuable.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.240]   Yeah, I mean look at
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.540]   this is a silly example.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.240]   Look at how Lionel Messi plays soccer.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.540]   Watch him on a soccer field.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.540]   This is one of the things that
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.040]   announcers have bemoaned about him
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.740]   throughout his career.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.240]   He walks around the pitch all the time
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.140]   and to the untrained eye
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.340]   it looks like he's bored.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.640]   I mean during the World Cup final
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.040]   he's like walking around
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.940]   in the latter seconds of that match
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.240]   just like sort of aimlessly
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.140]   looking around and walking around
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.340]   and then all of a sudden he
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.640]   bursts into action
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.240]   and deploys all of his energy
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.340]   into a single moment where he knows
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.040]   there isn't a 1000x upside potential
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.740]   in that moment
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.940]   and scores one of the game winning goals.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.340]   And that is like the perfect example to me.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.540]   You can be bored
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.840]   and then really deploy all of your energy
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.740]   into those 1000x opportunities
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.940]   that offer that asymmetric upside.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.540]   Yeah, I think also watching Lionel Messi
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.140]   not moving around
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.640]   probably fits into the effort paradox as well
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.440]   because I think he knows what he's doing.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.840]   Yes, he definitely knows.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.640]   And maybe as we hit each one
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.140]   feel free to recap them.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.840]   Yeah, he definitely knows what he's doing.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.140]   You know the effort paradox
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.540]   athletes are the best with this one.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   So I totally agree with you.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.040]   The effort paradox is the idea
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.740]   that you have to put in more effort
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.840]   in order for something to appear effortless.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.740]   Like the idea that
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.940]   effortless elegant performances
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.340]   are really just the result
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.340]   of thousands and thousands of hours
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.940]   of effortful practice.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.740]   Watching Roger Federer play tennis in his prime
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.540]   if you're a tennis fan
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.740]   is a perfect example of this.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.440]   Like his strokes just look completely effortless
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.340]   but they're the result of
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.740]   thousands and thousands of hours
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.040]   of compounded, effortful practice.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.740]   There's this phrase
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.240]   which I might butcher the pronunciation of
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.640]   sprezzatura
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.040]   which is an Italian phrase
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.540]   I think from like the 15th century
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.140]   a guy by the name of Baldassare Castiglione
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.240]   who wrote this book
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.840]   called The Book of the Courtier.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.140]   And the whole book was about
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.040]   how to be an ideal courtier
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.440]   like a person of the court
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.940]   in these royal courts.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.340]   And he basically said that people should
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.640]   an ideal courtier should walk with a sprezzatura
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.340]   which he defines as like a
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.040]   studied nonchalance
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.240]   meaning it appears effortless
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.940]   but there is a studied element to it.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.140]   Like you've worked so hard
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.040]   to make something appear effortless
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.840]   in the way that you walk.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   And that is the goal
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.140]   that all of us are pursuing.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:53.840]   That's like, you know,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.240]   reaching that level of like unconscious
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.640]   competence in something
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   where you can just do it
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.640]   and make it appear completely effortless
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.740]   to do the thing.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.640]   That's kind of the pursuit that we're all on
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.340]   in whatever our field or craft is
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.140]   is to reach that level of elegance
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.040]   in the way that we move.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.540]   Yeah, I was
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.240]   I mean, I don't know if you've seen Free Solo
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.240]   but my sport that I've done
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.440]   He's a perfect example of it.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.840]   I've rock climbed for a long time
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.440]   and the ability to make rock climbing
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.040]   look natural is so much practice.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.240]   And it's also a great sport
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.440]   to take someone who is very very in shape
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.140]   but has never been rock climbing
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.040]   if you want to feel good about yourself.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   So you're going to take me rock climbing sometime.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.940]   I get invited to do a lot of rock climbing
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.840]   and I always hesitate
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.340]   because it scares me.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.540]   But Alex Honnold is someone
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.940]   that I would love to meet someday
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.040]   because just like the way
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.640]   that his mind works around these things
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.940]   is just fascinating.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.240]   It's yeah, a venture firm
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.740]   that I raised money from
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.240]   had a private event with Alex Honnold
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.040]   a couple weeks ago
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.840]   and it was really awesome
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.640]   to have like a small group
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.340]   non-recorded closed-door conversation.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.140]   He is a fascinating individual.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.940]   I mean the cinematography in that movie
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.240]   is otherworldly.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   I think it was Jimmy Lee
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.540]   or no, it's Jimmy Chin.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.940]   Jimmy Chin is the guy that does it
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.140]   who's an unbelievable climber himself
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.040]   and for the whole team
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.440]   to be able to actually get those shots
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.340]   unbelievable climbers.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.140]   But that movie is incredible.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.540]   I just assume people have seen it
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.340]   but if you haven't strong strong drop everything.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.340]   It's like a drop everything
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.240]   and watch that movie
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.040]   unless you're like terribly afraid of heights
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.840]   in which case you might get
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.540]   like kind of triggered by it.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.740]   Yeah, I could see being yeah.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.940]   I took a friend of mine rock climbing once
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.040]   just assuming this is I don't
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.740]   there's probably some pair about paradox
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.940]   or lesson in this.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.840]   I assumed that he would know
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.640]   that climbing gear is safe,
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.740]   but he'd never been climbing.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.440]   And so we were in Australia
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   and we did a five pitch climb
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.140]   in the Blue Mountains,
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.340]   which is basically five pitch.
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.740]   Yeah, five pitches you climb up
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.840]   and then you pull your gear
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.640]   and your ropes and then you climb again.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.940]   It's like five stages
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.340]   and this is where you're like setting your gear
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.640]   in the rock like you're taking a thing
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.840]   pushing it between a crack
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.640]   and trusting that it will hold you
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   having done it myself.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.640]   I'm like, yeah, that works my friend.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.440]   I never rock climbed
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.240]   and we weren't doing necessarily a hard climb
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   if we were in a gym,
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   it would have been like a walk in the park
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.140]   for everyone,
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.440]   but we're like up on this wall
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.840]   and it never crossed my mind
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.640]   that he might not trust all of this stuff
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.640]   and I just remember by the end.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.340]   He was I have a I had a GoPro on.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.540]   He was just cursing me.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.940]   He was so mad,
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.840]   but there's nothing he could do
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.140]   because we're having a wall.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.640]   Yeah, there's just no option.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.840]   I I mean, I'm kind of with your friend on this
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.340]   like on all of these things.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.740]   I'm I'm not like a big risk taker in general.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.340]   And so like when I have friends
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.340]   that do these kind of things,
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.340]   I'm like, dude, you have kids.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.140]   Why are you doing that?
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.840]   Like, you know, like I've even scuba diving.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.140]   I'm like, why are you scuba diving?
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.940]   Don't scuba dive.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.240]   Just like go snorkeling.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.340]   You're on the top of the water.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.140]   You're totally fine.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.040]   Like, do you really need to get
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.640]   into the fishes environment
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.140]   and like be down there in their house?
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.240]   Like they don't want you there either.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.340]   Just chill on the top.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.240]   You don't have like a pressurized tank
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.540]   of oxygen on your back.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.640]   Like you're totally fine
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.740]   if something goes wrong.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.140]   I never understood why people
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.340]   want to go do these things.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.240]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.040]   I snorkeling scuba diving for me
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.940]   actually was one where I just feel like
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.440]   if you do it enough,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.140]   I just kind of get bored with it.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.040]   I guess it's like I've seen a lot of these things.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.140]   So it's fallen off.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.540]   Yeah, and then people go to you know,
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.140]   and then you're like,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.340]   oh, well now I need to scuba dive
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.140]   in like shark chummed waters.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.440]   Like so now I need to go do this.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.040]   It's like, okay.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   Well, then if you go get bit by a shark,
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.240]   I'm not going to feel bad for you
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.740]   if you decided to go do that.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.440]   I will put an endorsement in
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.940]   which you probably won't take.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.740]   In Hawaii, there is
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.940]   Pelagic shark diving
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.540]   where it's just snorkeling with sharks.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.940]   So you're kind of free diving
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.140]   and snorkeling in the sharks environment
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.840]   with a marine biologist
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.940]   who knows what they're doing.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.540]   But it's like,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.340]   what do you mean they know
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.340]   what they're doing?
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.940]   Like they're going to wrestle the shark
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.040]   if the shark comes.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.140]   Like that makes no sense.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.440]   Why?
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:47.940]   Like why?
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.640]   Why would you just to see a shark?
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.140]   I mean, it was
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.440]   it was actually really fascinating
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.140]   because it was it was kind of like
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.840]   go get a lesson about sharks
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.740]   and be in their environment.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.840]   And I guess it's not control.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.340]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.640]   You're in the water with the shark.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.240]   Like what do you do
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.540]   if the shark just comes at you?
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.840]   You just try to run away
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.540]   like you're swimming.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.340]   She had like a pole.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.640]   That's really going to stop a shark.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640]   That sounds great.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640]   I mean, it sounds like fun.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.840]   There was one shark and she's like,
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.640]   well, there's one shark with a lazy eye.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.840]   It's very docile.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.740]   If it comes towards you,
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.240]   don't be too worried.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.140]   And so it's a lazy eye.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.640]   So this shark would swim near people
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.240]   and she just kind of like bop it on the nose
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.040]   and it would swim away.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   But I thought
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.240]   you probably won't take me up on it,
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   but it's I believe it's on
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.440]   either the Big Island or now.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   I can't remember which island.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.740]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.740]   But we did this shark.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.440]   It was amazing.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.140]   I'm just going to stick
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.540]   to watching National Geographic.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.340]   I'm going to get my like
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.140]   Apple Vision plus immersive experience.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.340]   It'll basically be like
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.940]   I was in the water with you guys,
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.140]   except without the,
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.740]   you know, shark potentially eating me.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.240]   Yeah, OK, fair.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.440]   OK, OK, let's let's get back on track.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.140]   Let's go to the talking paradox.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.540]   And and this was particular.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.640]   I have a couple anecdotes
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.840]   here that came up recently.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.540]   All right, go for it.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.440]   Basic idea with the talking paradox
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.040]   is you actually in order to be heard more,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.340]   like if you want your ideas to be heard,
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.740]   you should listen twice as much as you speak.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.940]   And again, it's counter
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.740]   to what you would think,
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   which is the more I talk,
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.440]   the more I push my ideas out there.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.240]   If I'm in a room,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.440]   I need to be the loudest one.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.540]   I need to get my ideas heard
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.140]   completely counter to that.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.940]   The people that you actually listen
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.040]   to the most are the people
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.840]   that listen a whole lot.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.440]   And then when they do speak,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.840]   it is incredibly pointed, interesting,
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.440]   insightful speaking.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.640]   There's some quote.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.840]   I'm going to forget who it is.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.140]   Maybe it's Epictetus that it's like
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.440]   you have you have two ears
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.540]   and one mouth.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.540]   You need to use them accordingly.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.840]   And it's very true.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.640]   And something that I think of a lot
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.440]   like in group events,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.940]   at retreats, at different things
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.540]   that I go to the person
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.040]   that I inevitably leave
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.640]   being most impressed by
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.140]   is the person who said very few words.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.440]   But when they did speak,
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.740]   it was unbelievably poignant.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.740]   Yeah, there was a partner
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.140]   at Google Ventures, Joe Krause,
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.640]   who's one of the I guess
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.840]   I call him wisest people I know.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.740]   And he had this thing
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.940]   where he didn't talk much.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.140]   And then when he did right
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.840]   before, he'd kind of
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.540]   put his hands together like this
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.940]   and we'd all be sitting in the room.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.440]   That's like a common thread, by the way.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.540]   I feel like they always are like, OK,
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.440]   talking Yoda.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.040]   And I just remember
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.940]   we're all sitting around the room
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.440]   and then all of a sudden
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.640]   you'd see Joe put his hands up
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   and I would be like, quiet down
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   and and listen intently.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.340]   And I'm curious.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.940]   I feel like this should be a goal for mine,
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.840]   I guess, being a podcaster
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.640]   makes it hard to be like,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.440]   oh, I should talk less.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.540]   But. Do you feel like you do this well?
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.740]   And if so.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.940]   How much are you thinking
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:40.940]   about what you're saying?
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.140]   Because I feel like,
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.440]   you know, to go back to Arthur Brooks,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.340]   he has this whole concept
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.540]   of crystallized intelligence.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.840]   And as you, you know,
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.440]   grow in your professional life,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.140]   you've built up
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.440]   such a wealth of knowledge.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.940]   I feel like sometimes
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.740]   it can be easy
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.540]   to just speak off the cuff.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.940]   Do you have any any tips
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.540]   for kind of restraining
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.940]   to really hone and focus
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.440]   when you kind of know the answer?
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.740]   But if you took a minute,
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.640]   you could piece together
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   an even more profound response.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.040]   To answer your first question,
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.940]   I think I'm improving at it,
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.040]   but it doesn't come natural to me.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.240]   I'm a storyteller.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.640]   Naturally, I love,
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.740]   you know, telling stories,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.640]   embellishing story,
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.440]   like in locker rooms.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   Like that was always my thing.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.240]   I was like always kind of
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.340]   the loud one in that way.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.440]   And I need to force myself
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   to go into, you know,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.840]   what I call listen mode,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.440]   which is like when you're around people,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.640]   especially people that have
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.440]   different views than you.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.540]   You really need to make an effort
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.040]   to listen twice as much as you speak.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   And it's really hard to do
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   because when someone says something
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   you don't agree with,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.340]   your first reaction is like,
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.740]   let me jump in there and contest it.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.140]   Let me tell you why you're wrong, etc.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.340]   And you learn a whole lot more
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.040]   about the world, about yourself,
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.240]   about the other person
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.740]   by defaulting to listening
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.940]   in those situations
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.440]   because no one believes something
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   for no reason.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.740]   Like when someone has a belief,
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.940]   when someone has a perspective,
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.340]   when there's a fence sitting there,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.340]   there's always a reason
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.440]   that the fence is there.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   So I think it's something that we all,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.940]   you know, I definitely need to improve on.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.040]   I think we all probably need to improve on.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.940]   Your second question on like,
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.740]   you know, kind of ways and tips and heuristics.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.940]   I think that it's just that.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.040]   It's like when you're in a situation
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.240]   and you're listening,
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.840]   actually make sure you're listening to the person,
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.140]   not formulating your response in the moment.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.940]   I think there's a point in time,
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.440]   you know, when you've kind of gotten
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.140]   the gist of what someone is saying,
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.340]   when you kind of turn to,
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.040]   okay, now I'm like, I'm listening,
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.640]   but I'm also creating the narrative
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.840]   of what I'm going to say in my mind.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.440]   But it's usually later than you think.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.140]   Most people, I think, stop listening
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.940]   very, very quickly in someone's dialogue.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.240]   Like, even when we're having a podcast conversation,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.440]   you notice, if you start becoming aware of it,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.440]   at what point in the person speaking
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.440]   are you starting to think about
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.240]   what you're going to say next?
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.940]   Like you right now, you're probably thinking about like,
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.340]   okay, what am I going to say next?
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.840]   Because it's the natural way that a conversation goes.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.640]   Learning to like uncomfortably push that back
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.240]   a little bit and listen a little bit longer,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.340]   I find that you learn a lot more from the other person.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.540]   And then as a result,
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.640]   you end up coming up with more insightful responses
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.240]   that sort of drive conversations forward.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.340]   - Yeah, I just interviewed.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.440]   It's funny 'cause I want to go back and listen to it.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.240]   'Cause sometimes when you're in the moment like this,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   I'm not always the best at listening
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.840]   'cause I'm trying to plan the conversation
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.940]   and it's a little bit my responsibility and job even.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.340]   But there's a Stanford professor, Matt Abrahams,
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.640]   who his episode will be coming out.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.440]   By the time you hear this, you'll have heard it.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.040]   But it comes out, I think next week.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.940]   And he's written a bunch of books on impromptu speaking
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.040]   and how to become more natural at it.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   And by becoming more natural at it,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.340]   you can feel more confident pushing back the point
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.140]   at which you start thinking of what you're gonna say.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.940]   - That's interesting.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.940]   I read an article recently
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.340]   on ways to become a better conversationalist,
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.440]   which I thought was really interesting
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.940]   because it's such an important trait,
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.340]   being a good conversationalist,
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.440]   that you don't really ever study,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.040]   read about, think about.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.840]   And it was written by an improv,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.740]   like a person that is an expert at improv,
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.140]   which is an unbelievable skill.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.440]   Like if you've never done it, gone to an improv class,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.040]   et cetera, it's a great way to get better at public speaking,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.640]   to get better at conversations, et cetera.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.840]   And what he talks about, like his mental model,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.640]   his framework for improving as a conversationalist,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.440]   it's all about creating
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.140]   what he calls doorknobs in conversations.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.540]   Like you say something that is a doorknob
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.440]   that someone else can open and walk through.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.340]   Like you're not asking them necessarily a direct question,
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.440]   but you're making statements
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.240]   that are inviting someone to open the doorknob
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.440]   and walk through the door.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.940]   You know, so like he, the article is great,
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.140]   we should link to it in the show notes,
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.340]   but it's got a whole bunch of like
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.540]   really interesting examples of that,
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.240]   like in an improv context of how you create a doorknob
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   rather than just like making a statement
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.740]   or doing something that sort of like
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.740]   closes off a conversation.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.840]   It's funny 'cause it might be the same person,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.240]   I don't remember the name,
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.740]   but after I did this call with Matt,
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.240]   after I did this interview with Matt,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.140]   he sent me a list and he was like,
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.940]   here are a few people that I think
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.740]   would be great for your show.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.940]   And I was like, gosh, all of the topics
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.240]   and mainly 'cause they're mostly
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.140]   other Stanford professors in his department,
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.040]   where one of them was about improv,
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.940]   they were all kind of related to conversational skills.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.840]   And I was like, gosh, I don't know if I'm gonna have
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.240]   four conversational skill episodes in a quarter,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.340]   but I don't know, it's really important.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.840]   So I'm like, I'm definitely gonna line 'em up.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.340]   So keep an eye out for at least one more in the future.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.240]   - Yeah, I do think, I mean improv,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.640]   it's something I wish I had done at a younger age,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.440]   like I wish I had done an improv class in college.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.740]   So maybe this is very rare,
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.340]   but it was a required class in my middle school.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.740]   So everyone in my middle school--
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.640]   - We had drama, actually we had to do drama.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.240]   - Yeah, and I think maybe it was drama,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.740]   but I remember playing like park bench.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.340]   If you ever played park bench, the improv,
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.040]   like, I don't know what you even call, skit?
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.840]   I don't know, exercise?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.540]   We would play it in school
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.340]   and you would have to kind of rehearse and,
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.740]   not you didn't rehearse 'cause it was improv,
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.940]   but like it was a thing that we would do in school.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.540]   And I don't know, I feel like,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.140]   I feel like this about a lot of education.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.040]   There's all these things that I was exposed to
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   in middle school, high school, elementary school,
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.740]   that looking back, I'm like,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.140]   why didn't I like really appreciate what I was doing?
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.640]   At the time I was like, oh, this is silly.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.540]   And now I'm like, oh, improv, I should've practiced more.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.240]   - I mean, that was what I was gonna say is like,
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   I think we had that too.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.440]   We had drama and we had to do stuff like that.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.740]   But I, and I'm sure all of my classmates,
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.840]   were at the time so insecure and so self-conscious
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.640]   that you basically don't take advantage of it.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.140]   Like you're not actually building the skill
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.240]   'cause you're so worried about other people judging you
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.140]   and laughing at you.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.240]   You know, like I was probably like,
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.840]   I probably had a bunch of zits on my face
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.440]   and I was probably like, you know,
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.640]   trying to hide from some cute girl that was in the class.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.140]   I didn't want to embarrass myself.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.540]   And you know, you're like suffering
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   from the ultimate spotlight effect at that age
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.640]   where you just assume that everyone is staring at you
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.240]   when in reality, everyone is just worried about themselves
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   in that same moment.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.640]   But like, I would love to go take an improv class now.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   Now I might think about doing it.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.240]   Like I'm sure New York has some of the best
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.440]   improv classes in the world.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.040]   I think it'd be really fun at this age
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.440]   where I'm like secure enough to not really care
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.540]   if I'm embarrassing and bad at it.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.240]   - It'd be interesting even to just think about,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   like I went to a conference last week in Hawaii
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.640]   and it was atypical in that it was not
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.440]   your standard conference with keynotes
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.440]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   And their thing, which was,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.740]   there's this thing called the game.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.640]   And the best I'd describe it is like scavenger hunt
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.140]   meets escape room in groups of five.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.040]   And, you know, you kind of get to know people
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.540]   and you do all these kind of mental challenging exercises,
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.940]   but it'd be interesting at the next kind of conference,
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   summit, off-site mastermind, whatever you call it,
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.640]   to just have an improv person come and do a class.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.480]   I don't know.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.340]   I know you go to a lot of these events.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.640]   You probably host some of them.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.540]   That's maybe a really cool idea.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.640]   - I like that a lot.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.140]   - I expect an invite.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.540]   - You're in.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.140]   - Okay, so speaking of that conference I went to,
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.740]   let's talk about the productivity paradox
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.940]   because I thought a lot about this in a session I led.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.240]   So this is all grounded in Parkinson's law,
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   which is the idea that work expands
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.640]   to fill the time allotted for its completion.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.840]   Basically, when you leave something open-ended
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.140]   and you have the whole day to do it,
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.740]   it'll take you the whole day to do it.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.640]   And if you bucket it into a single hour,
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.040]   you'll find a way to get it done in a single hour.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.840]   The most classic example of this
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.740]   in like our modern work context,
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.240]   I would say is like email.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.640]   If you allow it to happen,
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.240]   you will spend the entire day emailing.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.540]   I spent a lot of my life doing this.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.840]   Like the early years of my career,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.240]   email would just take the entire day.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.040]   Or if you batch email into a single hour,
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.880]   and you're like,
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.540]   "I need to get through my entire inbox in this hour,"
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.240]   you will get that done.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.540]   And so the productivity paradox
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.240]   is basically grounded in that exact idea.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.140]   It's like less time,
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.940]   you become actually more productive
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.940]   when you can work less and actually get more done.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.540]   - Yeah, there was a whole session at this conference.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.440]   So it wasn't keynotes.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.140]   It was kind of user-generated conversations,
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.140]   but about productivity, that was one.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.240]   And then there was another one where someone was talking.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.540]   I led this talk about the concept of die with zero,
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.940]   focusing on net fulfillment,
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.940]   how to prioritize things in your life.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.140]   And someone said, "Oh, sometimes during the day,
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.140]   "if I need some creativity or I just need a break,
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.340]   "I'll just go mountain biking."
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.240]   And someone was like, "Well, how do you just take
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.740]   "two hours off in the middle of the day?"
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   And we talked about, it turns out
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.640]   that if you take two hours out of your day,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.640]   you can usually just get all the stuff done anyways.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.940]   And so-- - I mean, Tim Ferriss,
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.540]   just to, sorry to interrupt you.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.940]   I mean, Tim Ferriss, I would say, revolutionized this idea
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.640]   with 4-Hour Workweek, because he was the first person
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.340]   that just put on paper the idea of,
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.340]   if you could only work for an hour the entire week,
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.340]   what would you do?
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.740]   And how would you get it done?
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.940]   He has mastered the art of asking
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.640]   the seemingly absurd question
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.540]   that forces you to scrub away assumptions
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.240]   that you might've had about your work.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   And I actually went through that exercise.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   I really thought, okay, if I could only work
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.740]   for four hours a day, I used to work 12 hours a day
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.040]   at a minimum when I was working in private equity.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.540]   If I could only work for two hours a day,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.140]   if I could only work for four hours a day,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.040]   what would I do?
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.840]   And how would I continue to make just as much,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.140]   if not more money doing it?
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.640]   And what you realize is that you're spending time
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.640]   on a lot of things that you could either delegate,
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.340]   delete from your life, outsource, whatever,
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.540]   and really focus on the things
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.140]   that are really moving the needle.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.140]   And that's what you would do if you only had two hours.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.140]   Like, gun to your head,
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.740]   if you only had two hours, what would you do?
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.840]   He recently asked one that was,
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.340]   if you had to accomplish your 10-year goals
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.240]   in the next six months, what would you do?
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.340]   And how would you do it?
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.740]   And that's another one where it's like, okay,
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.040]   all of these assumptions I've had
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   for the long-term nature of anything,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.940]   how do I scrub those away?
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.040]   And just think about what would have to change in my life?
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.540]   What constraints would have to be removed?
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.040]   What environments would have to be changed
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.840]   for me to go unbelievable monk mode sprint
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.940]   on this given thing?
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.940]   I just think it's worthwhile
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.440]   to ask yourself those questions
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.540]   to continue improving the overall flow
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.040]   of what your life looks like.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.140]   Yeah, you mentioned, Tim,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.340]   I'll give a shout-out to an episode he recently did
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.140]   with Sam Korkos from Levels.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.340]   He is the master delegator, optimizer, being efficient,
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.840]   I would argue that episode is like a masterclass
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.240]   in all productivity.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.040]   Is that the guy that has his day scheduled
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.840]   down to the minute where it's like,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   you look at his schedule
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.040]   and it's from 6/17 to 6/22 brush teeth?
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.940]   I don't think he actually is that.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.940]   I think he's more focused on how do I achieve this task?
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.940]   Where do I put it in the day?
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.140]   How many hours do I spend on it?
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.940]   How do I delegate it to someone else?
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.140]   What's a system for that?
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.440]   Lots of notion, lots of loom,
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.640]   uses maybe the most power user of loom
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.840]   in the world based on that episode.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.340]   We'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.040]   But on the note of moving fast,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.640]   this monk mode, get everything done,
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.240]   I think the common assumption is,
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.080]   well, if you need to do that,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.740]   you just need to not stop and just go.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.840]   But you have the speed paradox,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.540]   which says the opposite might be true.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.540]   Yeah, I mean, the speed paradox
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.140]   actually goes hand in hand here,
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.440]   which is almost like a meta paradox
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.840]   of you would assume that it doesn't.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.740]   The speed paradox is sometimes you have to slow down
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.340]   in order to speed up.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.540]   You know, like move slow to move fast.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.640]   And I think there's this common,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.440]   I think it's like Navy SEALs maybe,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.240]   it's a military phrase that's like
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.340]   slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.640]   And that's like where,
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.140]   kind of the ethos of this paradox.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.540]   The basic idea here though,
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.940]   when you slow down,
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.540]   slowing down is what allows you to identify
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.840]   the high upside, high leverage opportunities
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.340]   that you should deploy your effort into.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.840]   So like Lionel Messi,
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.640]   slowing down and walking around the pitch
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.740]   is what allows him to have the vision
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.940]   to see those moments
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.640]   where he should deploy all of his effort.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   If he was busy sprinting around
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.840]   in a million different directions,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.640]   huffing and puffing
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.040]   at an 190 beat per minute heart rate,
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.740]   he wouldn't be able to identify those opportunities
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.640]   because his plane of vision
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.840]   would be shifting all over the place.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.340]   His head would be bobbing all over the place.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.440]   It would be really hard to see it.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.940]   And so when you slow down,
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.640]   your vision gets really clear
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.340]   and you're able to actually identify
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.240]   where those things exist.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.240]   Yeah, it's so fascinating.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.840]   Speed is actually something
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.240]   I've been thinking a lot about,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.440]   especially when I was running a company.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.540]   It's like the name of the game
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.740]   in venture-backed startups
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.440]   is like move fast.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.240]   And there's a guy named James Currier
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   who has an investment fund called NFX,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   which I think is,
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.440]   he's one of the smartest people I know.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.540]   And his blog is, you know,
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.740]   pure written gold, in my opinion,
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.040]   if you're running a company.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.340]   And he gave this talk once
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.540]   and I'm so disappointed it wasn't recorded,
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.840]   but about speed.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.540]   And there were a few things
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.740]   that he pointed out.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.640]   A lot of it is fear.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.740]   The reason that you sometimes
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.940]   can't move as fast as you want
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.540]   is that you're just not sure
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.440]   how it will work.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.140]   And then once you get over that fear,
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.040]   things get unlocked.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.740]   And I think Roger Bannister is like
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.340]   the example everyone always gives,
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.640]   which is no one ever ran a four-minute mile.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.540]   1954, Roger Bannister runs a four-minute mile.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.740]   And I think within three months,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.040]   eight more people could do it.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.040]   It's like they didn't think it was possible.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.240]   It just hadn't even crossed their mind.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:01.840]   Was it fear?
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.040]   Was it something else?
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.540]   They just didn't believe it was possible.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.140]   And one of his tips was simplify everything.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.040]   And so in this slowing down phase
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.440]   before moving fast,
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.340]   and some of these examples
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.240]   are maybe business only,
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.340]   but he's like simplify every contract
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   you use with a vendor.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.240]   Like don't write custom things.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.840]   Say this is what we're using.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.340]   Budgeting.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.940]   It's like create a simple budgeting process.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.640]   But for health, an example I'll use,
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.440]   which I think slowing down to speed up
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.340]   is if you want to really focus on health,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.540]   slow down, think how do I just
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.940]   make my meals very simple?
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.740]   How do I make it incredibly easy for me
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.240]   to not be unhealthy?
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.540]   And that takes some foresight,
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.740]   what you stock in your pantry,
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.640]   how you do your shopping,
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.540]   how you do your meal prep.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.540]   But then it actually makes it really easy
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.240]   to quickly be on track with food goals.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.540]   So there was just so much in that talk.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.040]   If I could turn that into a podcast,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.940]   I'm like I'm going through in my mind
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.840]   all the things that he talked about.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   The best example he gave,
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.740]   which was so fascinating about mindset,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.740]   because he said mind is literally everything
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.740]   when it comes to moving fast.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.740]   So if you need to slow down
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.540]   to recalibrate your mind,
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.640]   but he was working at a software company
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.140]   that made video games.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.540]   And he had a team of 40,
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.140]   and they said it takes two years
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:14.740]   to make a video game.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.740]   That was the operating assumption.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.740]   And he said we're going to ship
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.540]   a video game in 21 days.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.840]   And 38 of the 40 people were like no.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.240]   And two of them were like we could try.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.940]   And he was like great.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.040]   This game looks great.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.340]   I don't know.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.440]   I think it was like a Facebook
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.240]   back in the day with Facebook games.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.640]   They just copied someone else's game.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.940]   But these two engineers
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.340]   and slowly over the 21 days people came on.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.440]   They actually did it.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.740]   And at the end,
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.540]   they were like we did this thing
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.340]   that everyone on the team
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.040]   thought would take two years.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.240]   We did in 21 days.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.440]   Now the funny part of the story
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.940]   is I believe they got a cease and desist
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.640]   like immediately after
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.440]   from the company they copied.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.540]   But it didn't matter
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.040]   because as soon as he finished,
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.540]   they said great.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.540]   We'll shut that game down.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.640]   Now my entire team knows
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.440]   we can build a game in 21 days.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.240]   We can go build our own original thing.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.140]   We don't have to worry about that.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.140]   But those 38 people thought it was impossible.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.840]   And so sometimes
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   you just have to like train yourself
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   or test yourself
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.140]   or push past that point
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.840]   at which you don't believe it's possible.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.040]   And that takes some slowing down
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.840]   and some forethought.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.040]   So that's a great story.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.840]   I have a lot of thoughts on speed
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.140]   and how valuable it can be
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.040]   and how just running straight into it
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.340]   might not be the best answer.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.140]   Yeah, and it's a broader metaphor for life.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.540]   Like, you know,
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.640]   there's the idea of work like a lion.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.440]   Like sprint, rest, and repeat.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.340]   And the rest is just as important as the sprint.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.240]   And that's a piece that most people lose sight of
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.540]   is you have to have the rest
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.640]   in order for the sprint
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.040]   to be as efficient as possible.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.940]   If you don't have the rest,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.740]   then your sprint is going to be a jog.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.940]   And most people
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.240]   and most work cultures
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.640]   default to a jog
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   where you're just sort of like
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.840]   grazing throughout the day.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.440]   Naval has talked about this.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.340]   And it's really true.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.840]   And so figuring out a way
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   to align your overall life
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.440]   professionally, personally, health, physically,
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.840]   all of these different areas
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.440]   into much more of a sprint
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.740]   and then rest system
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.940]   is much more efficient
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.940]   for actually driving progress.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:09.540]   And to go back,
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.240]   we started with the advice paradox.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.840]   And yes, much advice might not be helpful,
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.340]   but for a lot of scenarios
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.440]   and things you want to sprint on,
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.140]   there are probably some people
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.040]   whose advice is very relevant.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.640]   And so whether you're building something at a company
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.440]   or you're trying to dial in your health,
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.340]   not taking the time during that slowdown phase
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.840]   to seek out,
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   "Okay, is there someone
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.140]   who's done a very similar thing?
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.440]   Is there a playbook for it?
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.740]   Is there an answer out there
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.240]   so I don't have to solve every problem myself?"
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.840]   is something that I like to do
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.640]   in that kind of slowdown before sprint mode.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.340]   And so it could be as simple as,
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.440]   "Okay, if I just sprint into fitness,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.640]   I don't even know what I would do right now."
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.740]   But if I paused and said,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.640]   "Okay, is there someone
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.240]   who could design a workout regimen
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.740]   or someone who just has already designed one
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.940]   and published it on the internet
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.440]   or a friend that could just tell me something to do
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   so that I didn't spend all this time
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   swirling around what?"
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.640]   And so I think if you solve the what in advance
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.340]   during your wind down, kind of slowdown time,
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.740]   you can execute much, much faster.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.440]   - Yeah, the flip side to it,
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.040]   which you need to be aware of,
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.240]   is that sometimes slowing down
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   and doing all of that kind of research and evaluation
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.940]   is like procrastination in disguise,
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.440]   where like with fitness,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.840]   you would say like, "Okay, well,
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   let me slow down and figure out the right fitness
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.740]   and health regimen
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.740]   and I'm going to construct the best plan."
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.540]   And the reality is like,
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   you know, it's like kind of like the midwit meme
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.640]   where like in the middle, they're like,
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   "I'm going to, you know,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.040]   develop a two-tiered functional strength training program
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.340]   that involves hypertrophy,"
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.040]   you know, like all these middling things.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.240]   And then, you know, on the two ends of the midwit meme,
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.840]   it's like, "Move your body for 30 minutes a day."
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.940]   And you just do that.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.640]   And so sometimes you just need to watch out
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   for the fact that like,
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.340]   you're not slowing down as a means to procrastinate
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.940]   and like, "Oh, I need the perfect system."
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.440]   Well, you just need to start moving
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.840]   and you can figure it out as you go.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.040]   And so balancing those,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.140]   which again, are in like a little bit of tension,
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.440]   is an important thing.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.240]   - Yeah, in this talk that we had
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.340]   about "Die With Zero" and focusing on fulfillment,
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.180]   it was interesting.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.640]   There were kind of two camps
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   and somehow the discussion came up
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.940]   of like taking a year off
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.740]   and traveling with your family.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.540]   And two people had done this successfully.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.840]   One of them went to Europe with their kids
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.440]   and the other one, I can't remember,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.140]   took a sabbatical and did something.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.540]   And then the other half of the room was like,
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.840]   "I don't know how to do that.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.040]   Like, that seems impossible.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.340]   I've tried."
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.340]   And what was interesting was
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.240]   we ended up having this long conversation
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.340]   about why people don't set personal goals and deadlines
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.940]   and structure their personal ambitions
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.940]   like they would professional.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.740]   We've all, almost everyone listening,
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.440]   you and I, we've all been in a workplace
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.740]   where we're like, "Wow,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:54.040]   here's a thing that needs to be delivered by a date.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   What are we gonna do?"
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.340]   Well, we're gonna make sure this gets done in the first week
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.840]   and then we're gonna delegate this thing
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   and this person has four days to do it.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.540]   And then we sit down with our family and we're like,
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.440]   "Well, we wanna go on a trip to Europe."
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.640]   It's like, "Cool, we'll talk about that next week."
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.340]   Like, you just don't set up these kind of milestones
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.040]   and structure and, you know,
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.940]   I won't go as far as to call them OKRs,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.240]   but we just don't have a lot of process
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.240]   around our personal goals.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.140]   And so I think it was an episode I did with Ben Nempton
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.340]   who has written this book called "The Bucket List Journal,"
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.140]   had this crazy bucket list story,
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.540]   really fascinating guy.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.540]   And he was like, "People just need to set goals."
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.440]   Like, "What's the next step I'm gonna take
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.340]   towards this personal goal?"
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.240]   And so I think when it comes to procrastination,
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.540]   especially with health and personal stuff,
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.640]   you can slow down.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.040]   Like, I'm all for slowing down,
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.840]   but to help yourself not get caught in that procrastination
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.940]   and never make progress, set a goal, set a deadline,
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.140]   which we never do personally.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.540]   - Yeah, I mean, my book is going to have that incorporated
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.940]   as, like, in each of these domains.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.540]   And my book is gonna be called "The Five Types of Wealth."
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.340]   It's going to track, you know, your life
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.540]   across what I view as the five types of wealth.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.340]   And within each section, it's like,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.440]   helps you actually identify what are your goals
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.840]   and what are your anti-goals around those,
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.240]   each type of wealth, so that you can go and do that.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.440]   You can actually create a plan
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.540]   and actually make progress on these things.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.840]   - Can I try to guess the five?
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.940]   - No, we don't wanna do it now.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.440]   I don't wanna reveal all this before the book.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.640]   - Okay, okay, okay, well,
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.740]   when it comes to making progress in life,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.140]   we'll not talk about what types of wealth
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.940]   we wanna accumulate in our life,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.440]   but there is a lot of distraction.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.940]   And so I think you had two things
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.140]   that actually came up a little bit
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.340]   in that interview Tim did with Sam
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.040]   about things that can just get in the way of everything.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.240]   So let's talk about social media and news.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.140]   - Yeah, both near and dear to my heart
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.740]   for different reasons.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.540]   So the social media paradox,
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.640]   or you could call it the connectedness paradox,
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.340]   is this idea that we are, or we have,
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.140]   more connectedness than ever before,
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.140]   and yet we feel less connected
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.340]   to those around us simultaneously.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.840]   There was a viral video several years ago of Look Up.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.040]   It's like people just looking down at their phones all day
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.240]   and looking down at screens,
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.740]   and they forget to look up at the people
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.140]   that are sitting right in front of them.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.840]   And it's a really sad thing.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.240]   If you go walk around in New York City,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.840]   you're weird if you look at someone
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.040]   and smile and say hello.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.640]   And if you think 20 years ago, that was what you did.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.640]   You walked around, you tipped your hat at people.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.340]   That was the way that people lived,
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.240]   and you actually interacted with people face-to-face.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.840]   Today, a young person that's trying to date
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.140]   doesn't know how to go up to someone
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.040]   and talk to them in a bar, in a restaurant,
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.860]   or wherever they are.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.740]   They know how to swipe on their phone
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.640]   in order to meet people.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.240]   And I mean, it's a really, really powerful trend.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.040]   And what I think is happening now
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.340]   is like the pendulum swings.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.140]   And so you have this environment
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.840]   where everything is through your phones
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   and through your interactions
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.940]   and digital, social media, et cetera.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.840]   And you have this swing that sort of comes back
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.940]   towards in real life, real human connection.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:01.940]   And it's interesting to watch,
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.140]   and it's interesting to observe,
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.440]   especially with the rise of AI.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.140]   And so is the lesson,
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.240]   think about it differently or do it less?
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.440]   I think that the lesson is
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.840]   like put your damn phone down more often.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.440]   And this is coming from someone who,
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.140]   for work, quote-unquote,
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.840]   has to spend a lot of time on social media.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.940]   But I really need to make a concerted effort
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.040]   on a daily basis to put my phone down
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.640]   and to be present, in particular,
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.540]   with my wife and with my son.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.940]   Because it's very easy when you are so connected there
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.740]   and when the dopamine drip is so clear
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.240]   that comes from those things,
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.940]   to just keep your phone on you and keep checking,
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.440]   keep pulling it out, keep looking at the thing.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.840]   And that's what they're designed for.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.940]   Like these social media platforms
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.640]   and social media is a drug.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.240]   And it's a really effective drug
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.640]   because it continuously feeds you
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.140]   with these tiny little drips of dopamine
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.940]   that make you want to keep coming back.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.640]   And we need to find a way to disconnect from that
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.040]   in order to connect with the people around us.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.340]   - Have you ever experimented
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.040]   with just deleting the apps from your phone
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.940]   and only doing it on the computer?
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.780]   - I've tried.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.140]   It never has made that much of a difference for me.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.840]   Honestly, because a lot of my work is through my phone,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   I like being able to have access to it.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.340]   I've tried all the different apps
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.740]   that kind of restrict your time.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.240]   The iPhone now has a pretty good interface
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.540]   for restricting the amount of time
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.440]   you spend on an app during a day.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.840]   It requires the discipline to actually stick to it
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.440]   when you've hit the total by earlier in the day
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.640]   to actually stick to it.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.040]   But I've been able to create a system that works for me,
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.940]   which is basically like my phone gets put down
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.340]   at a certain time in the evening and that's it.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.840]   It's down.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.640]   - And what about news?
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.840]   - So the news paradox is the idea
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   that the more news you consume,
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.240]   the less well-informed you are.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.040]   This tends to be a somewhat controversial topic
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.740]   when you talk about it or share it.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.640]   Typically, you get a lot of people
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.840]   that actually work in media
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.940]   just saying you're an idiot or that's incorrect.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.740]   This goes back to the noise bottleneck
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.640]   that I talked about to Leb's idea at the beginning,
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   that as you consume more and more news,
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.740]   you're actually getting a higher ratio of noise to signal.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.640]   And so your overall understanding of the issue
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.340]   or of the world actually becomes worse
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.040]   despite the fact that you're consuming more,
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.040]   which you wouldn't expect.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.440]   I have personally found
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.640]   that my life has improved dramatically
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.540]   since I've dramatically reduced the amount of news I consume.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.240]   And I'm talking like,
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.940]   I cold turkey probably reduced my news consumption
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.740]   about like 95%, maybe like two years ago.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.740]   And I feel happier.
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.940]   I like have heavily curated my news sources
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.040]   to where like I read one or two things
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.840]   and I just know that I understand
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.740]   at least like a foundational level about the world.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:41.140]   If I wanna go deeper on an issue, I can do that.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.340]   I know where to do it and how to do it,
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.340]   but I don't feel like I'm hit by the barrage
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.540]   of like breaking news, urgent, blah, blah, blah,
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.840]   whatever all the things are on a daily basis.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.640]   And I actively avoid following and consuming
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.040]   from those accounts on Twitter
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.940]   or on any of the relevant platforms.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.140]   - So how do you use that 5% that's left?
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:58.980]   - How do I use it?
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.380]   - Yeah, like if you say,
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.780]   well, now I've bound my news consumption to a small amount.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.780]   Is it reading people who do a good job summarizing?
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.480]   Is it specific sources?
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.380]   - Yeah, I mean, like I think Axios does a great job
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.680]   as one of the platforms that is really good,
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.480]   but it's basically like one hit per day
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.080]   of like you're getting the basics
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.680]   of the things that are happening in the world
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.780]   and in any different arena you're interested in.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.580]   And then from there, if you wanna go deeper on something,
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.380]   like if you think, you know,
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.280]   as the heuristic that I've seen that I think is useful,
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.380]   like is something going to be relevant a month from now?
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.080]   And if so, you should probably try to know more about it.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.580]   Most of the news that we see on a daily basis
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.180]   is not relevant more than like an hour later.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.080]   And everything is labeled as breaking news.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.580]   Nothing is breaking news if everything is breaking news.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:45.380]   And, you know, they use it to get clicks.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.880]   I totally understand how media works.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.780]   So I totally get it and I get the incentives.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.180]   I get why, you know, they operate the way they do.
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.480]   I just don't wanna be hit by it and polluted by it
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   in the way that I think.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.180]   If I was going to like get, you know,
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.880]   crazy mentally connected to every single news story
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.880]   that came my way during the day,
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.480]   I would have no time to think about things
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.780]   that I actually care about.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.280]   And so I just try to actively avoid it.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.980]   - Yeah, I think news often also follows
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.880]   the productivity paradox.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.880]   And, you know, you could learn, if you turned on CNN
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.680]   and not to knock any particular news channel,
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.980]   but you could watch a specific piece of content
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.280]   for three hours and you're not gonna get
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   three hours of knowledge.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.380]   I think sometimes I find myself catching myself thinking,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.980]   "Oh, I'm gonna just consume this thing
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.380]   "that might take a long time."
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.220]   And then just pausing.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.880]   I think one of the ones for me is,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.580]   "Anytime Apple does a keynote."
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.580]   And yes, there's some excitement about it,
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.680]   but I find that I'm like, "Oh, I wanna watch the keynote."
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.180]   And I know it's gonna be an hour.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.880]   I also know I could read the summary of the keynote
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.680]   at the end in 10 minutes or five minutes
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.080]   and I catch myself.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   And I feel like anytime you put the news on TV
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.080]   or you could just fall into this trap
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   of somehow they can make a five minute piece expand
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.980]   and fill two hours and it can be mind-numbing.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.880]   - I mean, this is the whole thing with CNBC.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.480]   It's like financial news, right?
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.680]   Where no one is making a return by picking stocks.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.080]   You know, like most hedge funds aren't making alpha
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.780]   and their entire job is to do that.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.080]   So like you as a person sitting at home
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.580]   should probably not be spending your time picking stocks
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.580]   if that's not like your exclusive job
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.880]   and you're one of the best in the world at it.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.880]   You probably shouldn't.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.480]   It's not a great allocation of resources and time.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.080]   And yet CNBC, the entire day, 24 hours a day
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.380]   has people jumping on, trotting up there
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.580]   and talking about stocks
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.180]   that they're interested in and stock picks.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.780]   And there's this story that I've heard
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.080]   of like someone getting asked this,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.880]   like, "How can you possibly do this?
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.280]   Like Kramer's on for all these hours.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.880]   He has all these terrible stock picks."
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.380]   And you need to reframe it as it's entertainment.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.480]   Like we have 24 hours of programming that we need to fill.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.880]   And so we need entertaining people to be up there.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.280]   And like a lot of news has become entertainment.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.580]   It's no longer information.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.180]   It's like, they're trying to hook you.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.380]   They're trying to keep you there and keep you entertained.
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.680]   And what's entertaining, but like blaring,
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.480]   breaking news in all red, bold font,
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.780]   sitting across the page.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.980]   It's not entertaining for them to talk about,
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.780]   you know, the new speed bumps that were put in in your city
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.080]   or, you know, the, you know,
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.280]   Girl Scout cookie campaign that's going on.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.580]   What's entertaining for them
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.380]   and what keeps people there is fear.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.080]   It's like, "Hey, so and so, these many people got killed.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.880]   This terrorist attack happened, this thing."
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.080]   Like, that's what's keeping people there.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.380]   And it makes you think that the entire world is that,
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.580]   is that's what's going on, right?
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.580]   There was this chart that was like
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.780]   comparing actual causes of death
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:44.180]   to causes of death talked about in the media side by side.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.080]   And you look at it and like the actual causes of death
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.580]   was like heart disease, cancer,
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.880]   you know, like the actual things.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   And then when you look at the media one,
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.580]   it's like terrorism, you know, like crime, murders.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.780]   Like that was what it was.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.780]   It was like inverse.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.780]   Like it was literally like, it was like a parody almost,
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.980]   but it was reality.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.380]   And it's because what do they report on?
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.780]   It's the things that they think will get people to click
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.680]   and that will stick there.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.180]   And that's fear.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.780]   And if you want to live that way,
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.080]   that consume more of that.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.480]   - Yeah, I don't imagine the evening news
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.380]   focused on heart disease would be that exciting
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.180]   for the average person.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.680]   - There was this old movie, like way back in the day,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.380]   I think it might've been a Michael Moore movie.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.680]   Like, I feel like I saw it when I was 13 or 14.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.180]   I think it was called "Bullying for Columbine"
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.780]   that, you know, politics aside on all of this stuff,
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.680]   like there was just an interesting juxtaposition
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.080]   that I remember he did in it
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.980]   of like showing the news in Canada
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.880]   and then showing the news in the US.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.680]   And the Canadian one was like,
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.280]   it was looking at like speed bumps or something
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.380]   that got put like painted differently in town.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.380]   And then it showed the US one,
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.480]   which was all shootings and crime and all this stuff.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.280]   So it was interesting.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.380]   - Yeah, I used to watch PBS News Hour
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.180]   because it was just like a much more practical source of news.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.180]   And then I was like, oh,
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.580]   then they'd put all the news in a podcast for an hour.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.380]   I don't know where it dropped off in my routine,
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.980]   but it wasn't replaced by other news.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.180]   So I guess maybe that's a good thing.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.680]   But it was like a good, quick,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.580]   felt like it didn't go into the fear mongering.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.280]   - The other thing is there's a lot of opinion
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.580]   and not a lot of fact in news these days
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.880]   because it's entertainment,
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.280]   because that's what drives clicks
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.080]   and that's what drives the business model.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.780]   And that's challenging because like a lot of these,
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.780]   it seems like a lot of these news stories,
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.180]   they're changing minute to minute.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:27.280]   Like if you go look at the headline on one of their webpages
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.780]   when something happens, it's one thing.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.580]   You go back an hour later and the headline
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.480]   and the entire spin on it has changed
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.280]   because some new information surfaced, whatever it was.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.980]   And so it's actually hard to know at any point in time,
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.580]   like, okay, what am I getting?
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.380]   Like, is this real or is this biased in some way?
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.580]   Has this been hit by like a bunch of filters
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.680]   and like hierarchies, whatever it is.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.780]   It's hard to figure out like where can you actually count
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.380]   on the news source.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.280]   - So maybe we'll close out and put this all in perspective
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   with the death paradox.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.120]   - Oh.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.280]   - Just to take like a hard turn.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.480]   - We're gonna end on a really bright, shiny,
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.880]   sunny rainbows note.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.480]   - I think it kind of is.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.320]   - I agree.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   So memento mori is this idea of knowing your mortality.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:17.120]   It originates from, I think the Roman empire
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.820]   where the returning conquering hero
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:23.820]   after a military campaign would be paraded through the cities
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.820]   with adoring fans, cheering for them
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.520]   in this like golden chariot.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.220]   And they would place a person behind the conquering hero,
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.520]   whispering in their ear, memento mori,
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   which means like know your mortality.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.620]   Remember that you are mortal.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:40.420]   And the whole idea is that you have to know your death
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.020]   in order to live your life.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.220]   The idea is like, if you aren't aware
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.320]   of your own mortality, you expose yourself
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.720]   to a terrible thing and to terrible life.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.920]   So I think about this a lot.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.620]   You know, there's these calendars that have become
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.020]   this like very viral trend of like,
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:00.020]   it's 52 rows across, like squares across,
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.320]   and there's 80 squares down.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.020]   And the whole idea is that you shade one in
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.020]   every single week and you can actually see
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.220]   your own life sort of like going into black
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.320]   as you shade them in across your life.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.720]   And for some people, that's really morbid.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.720]   And for other people, it's really empowering
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.920]   to know that like every week matters.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.620]   I mean, you can physically see the weeks going by
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:21.920]   in your life and that the weeks
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.620]   you're never going to get back,
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:26.820]   how precious time is with people.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.920]   So it's something that I think about personally often,
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   probably much more often now that I'm a father
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   than before that.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.520]   But something that I think everyone
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.920]   should reconcile a bit more in their life.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   - Yeah, I mean, when you were talking about news,
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.720]   it's like, "Oh, do I want to cut out an hour here, here?"
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.220]   I think when you start to really put into perspective
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.920]   how much time you have on this earth,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.020]   is it 40,000 weeks or 4,000?
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.820]   - 4,000 weeks. - 4,000, I know, 40,000.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.820]   - There's a great book, by the way.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.320]   - Yeah, I don't know. - Oliver Berkman wrote
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.620]   "4,000 Weeks." - "4,000 Weeks."
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.420]   - It's an incredible book on all of this stuff.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.820]   - Yeah, and it just makes me think,
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.320]   you know, "Die With Zero" was a, you know,
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.120]   they're all in the light of, we have this limited time,
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:08.520]   focus on how we use it, prioritize things that matter,
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.120]   don't let things that you don't care about fill your days.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.620]   I feel like with that perspective,
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.120]   you could go back and think about a lot of these paradoxes
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.620]   and figure out the best way to apply them
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.820]   so that you're living a life that's truest to what you want,
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.620]   which unfortunately seems to be, not seems to be,
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.720]   is the most common regret most people have
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.520]   at the end of their life,
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.120]   is not living life true to what they want.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.320]   - Yeah, not all time is created equal.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.420]   I mean, you're like, you're in your 30s, I'm 32.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.620]   This 10-year period relative to the 10-year period
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.820]   when I'm 80 is very, very different
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.120]   in terms of what I can do with my son,
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.720]   in terms of what I can do with my parents
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.520]   while they're still around, all of these different things.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:53.420]   And so if you just wait, if you delay all satisfaction,
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:54.820]   if you continue to say, like,
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.620]   play the deferred happiness game of,
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.520]   "Oh, well, when I get to this much money
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.820]   "or when I get this promotion
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.120]   "or when I get whatever it is, then I'll be happy,"
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.820]   what you're gonna find is that you're gonna keep saying that
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:09.720]   until you die and until your kids are gone
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.620]   and they've moved off, they don't wanna hang out with you.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.020]   And until your parents are gone
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.520]   and you're not able to hang out with them
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   or spend time with them anymore.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.020]   And that's a terrible thing.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:21.020]   And it's really, really sad when that happens to people.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.020]   - Yeah, so I didn't mean to bring us to this place
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.420]   of thinking about death before the end,
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.820]   after we talk about the news, talking about death,
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.320]   but I think it's really valuable
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.020]   to put everything in perspective.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.020]   - I agree.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.620]   - All right, I think, I mean, obviously,
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.020]   we'll put a link to the multiple paradoxes.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.020]   I don't know how many there are in total
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.120]   'cause you wrote one with 10, 15.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   - Eight million, I don't know.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.420]   - One with 20, there were a lot,
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.120]   but I'll link to a few of them in the show notes.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.720]   We didn't get to all of them,
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.920]   but I think we hit on the ones
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.320]   that I was most excited to talk about.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.220]   - Yeah, this was awesome.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.420]   Really, really fun discussion.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.420]   - Yeah, thanks for being here in person.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.240]   - Love doing it.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.120]   - Next time we'll have to do it in the sauna.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:54.940]   It'll be a different conversation.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.320]   - We'll do sauna cold plunge
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.320]   and we'll see who can last longer in the cold plunge.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.120]   - We'll see, I need some practice.
