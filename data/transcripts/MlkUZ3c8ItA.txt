[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.200]   Thank you for that introduction and I also want to specifically thank Tai-Danae for inviting
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.400]   me and the opportunity to speak to all of you.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.880]   It's truly an honor.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.240]   So my talk today is going to be a little bit different than maybe than some of the others
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.560]   you've heard thus far at this symposium in that I am going to share more of a personal
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.520]   testimony.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.120]   When I was asked to speak at this symposium on a topic of my choosing, I felt compelled
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.160]   to share a testimony relating to my own career in STEM, which for me specifically has been
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.240]   in the field of chemical engineering.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.160]   I believe I felt compelled to share this testimony for a couple of reasons.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.360]   First I am nearing the end of my work career, I'm 63 now.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.400]   My research activities are winding down, I have a few PhD students left who I'm advising
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.440]   in my own research group and the most junior one will graduate in about three years.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   So I've been doing a lot of reflection on my life more generally and on my STEM career
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.360]   journey which has certainly been a significant part of my life.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.040]   I've been reflecting on what I did right, what I did wrong, what went well, what I would
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.200]   have changed.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.800]   And as I reflect on my career, the dominant theme in these reflections has been how was
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.080]   such a career journey even possible?
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.620]   Definitely not of my own doing.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.480]   My personal circumstances or even in some cases my own abilities would have never resulted
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.700]   in such a career.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.840]   That is the reason why I've entitled the talk "God's Faithfulness in an Unlikely STEM Journey"
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920]   because this unlikely journey was clearly God ordained.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.160]   For me, my path has been a miracle.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.320]   Not a miracle in that natural laws were violated, but a miracle in the sense that reflecting
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.760]   on the path brings amazement and wonder to me and more holistically a confirmation of
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.440]   the Lord's sovereignty and that the Lord's purposes will be accomplished for each of
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.880]   us who are servants of our risen Lord.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.520]   As Ephesians 2.10 says, "For we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.060]   works which God prepared in advance for us to do."
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.080]   So I share my story to encourage you in your own career journey, confident that God's plan
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.240]   for you is always the best, for your good and his glory, even during periods of turmoil
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.760]   and doubt, and to remain faithful witness to him and his truth in whatever job or career
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.520]   he has placed you.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.440]   So to start off with, even my STEM career journey began in an unlikely way.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.360]   A high school guidance counselor advised me to study chemical engineering based on my
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.960]   interest in math and chemistry.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.640]   I knew very little about the field and my parents didn't either.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.660]   My parents were not STEM people.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.860]   My father was an accountant and my mother did not go to college, so none of us had much
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.560]   idea about what chemical engineering entailed.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.160]   Now in retrospect, I'm also pretty surprised that the counselor gave me such career advice
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.440]   back in 1978, given that there were so few women in the engineering field at that time.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.700]   However, my parents and I didn't even know that.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.080]   We viewed my counselor as an authority figure, and from the information that we had access
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.480]   to in his guidance, chemical engineering looked to be associated with a potentially stable
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.400]   and in-demand job, so we followed his advice.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.020]   I should also add that my father was very keen on me getting a college degree.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.480]   That is a degree that could result in a good job.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.240]   He was quite adamant that I should be prepared to support myself and my children, and in
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.600]   case something ever happened to my future husband, which as I will get to did in fact
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   happen.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.520]   I applied to and was accepted at a few schools across the country, but ended up deciding
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.240]   to attend Purdue University in Indiana, a decision solely based on its proximity to
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.960]   I was extremely reluctant to venture far from home.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.520]   I very rarely traveled outside of Ohio at that point in my life, and I did not really
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.000]   even know Purdue was a terrific engineering school.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.640]   I just knew it offered engineering as a major, so I started attending Purdue and enjoyed
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.280]   my engineering classes.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.120]   The high school counselor was absolutely right.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.960]   However, I did have one major hiccup in my studies during my freshman year in physics.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.360]   I flunked the first test on statics and dynamics, a subject that is now pretty integral to my
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.120]   current research area of fluid and particle dynamics.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.480]   I just didn't understand the concepts in the class, or I wasn't thinking about them
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.920]   in the right way.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:29.760]   In any case, I made the decision to drop out of engineering, firmly believing that my lack
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.080]   of understanding was a clear indication that engineering was not for me.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.960]   Also part of my logic was that I had never failed any tests in school previously, so
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.160]   this major must have been wrong for me to get my first failing grade.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.120]   So I made an appointment with my academic advisor, changed my major, and called to tell
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   my parents.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.320]   I reached my mother.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.600]   My mother listened to me amidst my tears and told me in no uncertain terms that I was being
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.000]   ridiculous, that I needed to get back in there and keep trying.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.440]   She said that it made absolutely no sense to give up on my major after one failure.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.080]   And while I really was not convinced, I did what she said and canceled the appointment
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.560]   to change my major, mostly because this counsel was coming from a person who I knew unconditionally
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:29.440]   loved me and who I also knew mostly just wanted me to be safe and happy and foremost in Christ.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.280]   Anyway, shortly after that disastrous test, physics started to click for me, and somehow
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.840]   I ended up getting an A in that class.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.240]   And clearly I am not the only one who has ever felt like dropping out or changing majors
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.800]   because of a setback, because whenever I share my career journey with students or young professionals,
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.620]   this story is always the one that resonates the most with the audience.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.800]   So at this point, even though I've somewhat stumbled into engineering and then almost
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.240]   dropped out of engineering, I'm enjoying college and my classes, but with no thoughts or ideas
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.680]   about a career.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.960]   I was clueless in that regard.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.200]   But the Lord provided in abundance.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.680]   The Purdue Chemical Engineering Department had recently instituted a new advising process
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.440]   whereby every student was assigned a faculty member who had to approve the student's course
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.600]   plan each semester.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.000]   My assigned advisor was Professor Nicholas Peppis.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.100]   I was not thrilled with this process.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.440]   I didn't want to bother a professor, plus I was intimidated by them.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.160]   I remember at my first meeting with Professor Peppis and not even wanting to step in his
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   office.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.760]   I just extended my hand and announced, "Here's my form, please sign it."
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.440]   To my incredible surprise, he invited me into his office and spent almost an hour talking
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.640]   with me.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.840]   He asked me about my family, my educational background and interests, and my career goals,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.560]   of which I had none at that point.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.720]   He then graciously invited me to do undergraduate research in his group, to try out research
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.260]   as a possible career.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.160]   So I did and found out I loved research.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.320]   I came to find out after my undergraduate days that Professor Peppis is a fellow believer.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.760]   He's also been an incredible mentor and blessing to me throughout my entire career, providing
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.120]   advice when I didn't even know what questions to ask, helping me to apply for graduate school
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.600]   and faculty positions, teaching me how to write research proposals, and nominating me
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.160]   for many professional awards.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.720]   During my freshman year of college, I also met fellow chemical engineering student, Gavin
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   Sinclair.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.400]   Gavin was a Christian and we were both pretty motivated to do well in school.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   We started by doing homework together, later fell in love, and we were married after our
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.240]   sophomore year in college at 20 years of age.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.120]   After we both graduated with our bachelor's degrees in chemical engineering in 1983, Gavin
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.400]   went to work in the chemical industry for Air Products in Allentown, Pennsylvania, while
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.040]   I started graduate school in chemical engineering at Princeton.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.520]   We later bought a house in Flemington, New Jersey.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.320]   All was going well for several years.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.880]   Gavin was on the fast track in his career at Air Products and I was into my third year
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.800]   of PhD, having passed the qualifying exams, and I was four months pregnant with our first
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   child.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.680]   But things drastically changed a few weeks after that, when Gavin, at 24 years of age,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:36.480]   was diagnosed with a football-sized tumor in his chest, after having flu-like symptoms
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.280]   for a few weeks.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.320]   He was given four months to live, based on the type of cancer he had, malignant fibrous
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.440]   histiocytoma, a cancer that grows and spreads rapidly.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.040]   Needless to say, Gavin took a leave of absence from work and I also paused my graduate studies.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.160]   We moved in with my parents in Cincinnati and Gavin had aggressive chemotherapy and
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.120]   radiation over the next three months.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.640]   These treatments left him extremely weak and thin.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.320]   The treatments appeared to be halting the spread of the cancer, but nothing more.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.560]   Gavin's prognosis was still not good.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.000]   Fortunately, his oncologist in Cincinnati was able to get the attention of physicians
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.480]   at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City, as well as a surgeon willing to perform a
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.280]   very risky operation to potentially remove the massive tumor.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.120]   By God's grace, Gavin survived the surgery and the tumor was completely removed.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.680]   However, the surgery was extremely extensive.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.200]   Most of one of his lungs was removed, the sac around his heart was removed, he had radioactive
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.320]   seeds placed in his chest, and the nerve that went to one of his vocal cords was cut.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.880]   This surgery was only 10 days before our daughter was born.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.560]   On the day of her birth, somehow Gavin was able to sit in the corner of the delivery
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.880]   room, but since he was deemed radioactive due to the implanted seeds, he had to wear
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.400]   a lead vest.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.040]   Gavin often joked that most of the doctors who came into the delivery room were much
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.400]   more interested in the guy wearing the lead vest rather than the pregnant woman.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.520]   Gavin's surgery also left him in chronic pain, and the months following his surgery were
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.120]   very dark days.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.360]   He laid in bed pretty much all day, could only whisper because of his non-functioning
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.400]   vocal cord, and was totally unable to deal with our daughter Jeanette's arrival.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.440]   He was so weak that he could not even pick her up.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.920]   On my side, after several months of taking care of a sick husband, a new baby, and numerous
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.520]   failed attempts to restart computational research for my Ph.D., the whole situation became beyond
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.720]   my ability to handle.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.480]   Even though I was a Christian up until that time, I used to think God won't give me
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.320]   any more than I can handle.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:11.400]   A very bad take on 1 Corinthians 10.13, which says, "No temptation has overtaken you except
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.600]   what is common to mankind, and God is faithful.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.320]   He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear."
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.960]   I needed to learn that saying, "God won't give you any more than you can handle," is
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   a man-centered statement, which focuses on my abilities, my resourcefulness, or even
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.720]   my own self-imposed limits.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   But in 2 Corinthians 1.8-9, Paul says, "We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.160]   and sisters, about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.640]   We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.040]   life itself.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.200]   Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.740]   But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves, but on God, who raises the dead."
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.280]   No one wants to go through times that are beyond their ability to endure.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:20.440]   But sometimes the Lord, in his sovereign purpose, breaks us so that he can remake us.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.920]   The Word of God tells us in many places that we need to be refined.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.320]   Isaiah 48.10 says, "Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.560]   I have tested you in the furnace of affliction."
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.680]   And in Proverbs 17.3, "The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, but
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.200]   the Lord tests the heart."
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.800]   And finally in Psalm 66.10, "For you, God, have tested us.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.880]   You refined us like silver."
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:55.360]   Well that process was certainly happening to both Gavin and me during that time.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.680]   Before Gavin's illness, we thought we were doing pretty well, and we felt arrogantly
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   rather self-sufficient.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.960]   But there were so many spiritual lessons that we needed to learn, as well as a lot of other
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.160]   important truths about life and priorities.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.560]   God put us through what we needed so he could teach us these lessons.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.240]   I won't go through all the lessons here, but Gavin wrote a book about his experiences,
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.840]   and those around him also shared their experiences.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   The book is entitled All Things Work for Good, based on Romans 8.28.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.800]   Gavin wrote the book to be an encouragement to people with cancer or other serious illnesses,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.120]   as well as an encouragement to their family and friends.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.880]   In the book, he outlines 14 spiritual, physical, mental, and family lessons that can be helpful
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.180]   to others.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.200]   He also starts off the book by making the statement that he was actually glad he went
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.960]   through all his medical problems, so that he could learn these lessons, and hopefully
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.600]   help others learn these lessons without traveling the same road he did.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.720]   He often said, "If one person comes to know Christ because of what I went through, it
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.760]   was all worth it."
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.000]   One lesson in Gavin's book that I do want to share here that has impacted my career
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.580]   specifically is related to the support I received from Christian family and friends.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.040]   They consistently prayed and helped out in innumerable practical ways over the long haul
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.720]   of Gavin's illness.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.800]   I'll never forget the lady who was not in good health herself, who sent me a card almost
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.920]   every day in the mail for several years, telling me she was praying for us.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.440]   That was such an encouragement to me.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.560]   The lesson I need to learn was to ask for help.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.780]   I will also never forget when one of my lady friends from church admonished me regarding
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.200]   a child care situation in which I clearly need to help and did not ask for it.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.600]   She told me in no uncertain terms that I was being prideful.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.780]   Once again, I was relying on my own self-sufficiency, still an area of weakness for me, as well
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:12.340]   as I was denying someone else the blessing of service, and she was absolutely right.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:19.080]   So Gavin had a Teflon injection into his vocal cord to help his voice, and he took doctor-prescribed
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.180]   narcotic drugs to manage his pain.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:28.280]   His strength slowly improved so that within one year after his initial diagnosis, he was
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.440]   able to return to work.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.880]   I was also able to fully resume my Ph.D. studies.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:41.560]   Fortunately, my Ph.D. research was computational, so I could do most of it at home by logging
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.160]   into the Princeton computers via modem.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.780]   Now I'm really dating myself.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:54.840]   So I continued working on my degree until my funding and NSF Graduate Fellowship ended,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:01.620]   at which point I had completed the necessary simulations and analysis but had not yet written
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.800]   my thesis.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   A chemical engineering teaching position opened up at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.560]   While Lafayette College is an accredited engineering college, it does not offer any graduate degrees
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.880]   in engineering, so there were no research opportunities there to speak of.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:25.360]   But I applied for this position without finishing my Ph.D. degree because there were limited
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.400]   faculty job opportunities in the area and we could not move.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:37.200]   Gavin could not change jobs due to his pre-existing medical condition which created medical insurance
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.800]   eligibility constraints.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.320]   So I told Lafayette College I would finish up my degree soon because all I had to do
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.240]   was write up my thesis and I foolishly thought, again probably relying on my own abilities,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.480]   "How hard can that be?"
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:59.360]   Well it turned out to be extremely difficult to write a thesis while teaching full-time,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.120]   taking care of a young child, and Gavin had spinal surgery for a nerve block to mitigate
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.560]   his chronic pain during that period of time.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.400]   Gavin was also often sick, sometimes involving hospital stays, as his immune system was very
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.720]   weak after his intensive chemotherapy.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.600]   A year went by with no thesis.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.480]   Frankly, I had not even started it.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.800]   So my parents graciously offered for me to return to Cincinnati, yet again, to help with
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.200]   Jeanette so I could write my thesis.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.000]   My mother and father took care of Jeanette for 8 weeks straight while I pretty much stayed
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.860]   in a bedroom with a table, chair, and a Commodore 64 computer that I used to type my thesis.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:52.980]   My father-in-law was also a professional typesetter for a publishing company and he volunteered
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.740]   to typeset all of the over 200 equations in my thesis.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:04.040]   So getting my PhD thesis finished was certainly an all-family project.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.440]   I then successfully defended at Princeton.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:15.160]   After 6 years, 2 years longer than the average time to finish a PhD at that time, incredibly,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.600]   I had a PhD in chemical engineering.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.360]   Again, this would have never happened without God putting others in my path who provided
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.200]   support and expertise when it was most needed.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.860]   As Proverbs 19.21 says, "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.040]   of the Lord that will stand."
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.440]   About this time, Gavin's 3-year pre-existing condition for his medical insurance eligibility
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.160]   was no longer applicable.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.680]   His cancer had not returned so we could move.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.720]   I enjoyed teaching chemical engineering at Lafayette College, but really missed the innovation
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.140]   and new knowledge aspect associated with research.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:02.680]   So Gavin started looking for new job opportunities and I applied to a number of research intensive
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.360]   universities.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:11.120]   In my job search, I got asked a lot of questions about why it took so long to get a PhD, why
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.840]   I was teaching at Lafayette College if I wanted a research intensive faculty position, and
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.880]   why I had not written any new journal manuscripts for the prior 2 years.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.560]   I answered these questions frankly and received a lot of rejections, but Carnegie Mellon University
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.440]   in Pittsburgh expressed interest.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:36.200]   Gavin also had secured a job offer from PPG Industries in Pittsburgh.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.180]   So I had an on-site interview at Carnegie Mellon and received a faculty offer, along
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.160]   with the feedback that if I would have stayed at Lafayette College one more year without
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.960]   any research activity, I would have not been hired.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.240]   That said, I joined the faculty and my colleagues treated me very well.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.880]   And at this point, Gavin and I are 30 years of age and Jeanette is 3 years old.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.760]   But when I began at Carnegie Mellon, I started feeling pretty apprehensive, worrying about
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   if I would be able to receive tenure while raising a small child or if I would be able
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.280]   to secure sufficient research funding to support all my graduate students.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.240]   But this apprehension only reared its ugly head when my thoughts were focused once again
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.720]   on my own abilities or perceived problems.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.200]   Although I had thought I had learned some important lessons through Gavin's illness,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.680]   I kept slipping back into pride and self-reliance.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.760]   I should have spent more time in prayer, both humbling myself in my constant need for God
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.660]   and praising him for his clearly abundant provision in my life.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:47.560]   When I actually did focus each day on being a faithful steward of the gifts God had given
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   me and in the position in which he had placed me, my worries about the future dissipated.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   I then had peace that surpasses all understanding, the same peace that Gavin came to possess
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.720]   through his medical trials.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.760]   I also knew with full confidence that even if this position didn't work out, God would
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.040]   show me a new and better path.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.400]   God commands us not to worry, but he will help us fulfill this command if we keep our
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.160]   eyes focused on him and not ourselves.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.880]   Matthew 6.34 says, "Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.000]   be anxious for itself.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.400]   Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:37.880]   Philippians 4.6-7 says, "Do not be anxious or worried about anything, but in everything
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:43.320]   by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your requests known to God.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:49.040]   And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, stands guard over your hearts
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.920]   and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.880]   Things at Carnegie Mellon turned out to go extremely well.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:02.680]   I received a lot of grants, had great PhD students, wrote research papers, and was promoted
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.880]   to associate professor.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.840]   Teaching was also a breeze because I had taught almost every chemical engineering course during
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.480]   my time at Lafayette College.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.520]   Because I had teaching down and lecture notes for all the courses, I was able to use my
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:23.480]   more limited time, work time, compared to my colleagues to focus on research.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.680]   Gavin was also doing well in his job at PPG and managed to complete a PhD in economics
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.040]   at Carnegie Mellon at the same time while working full-time.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.520]   He was an amazing person, incredibly productive and creative.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:42.400]   However, Gavin was also diagnosed at the time with congestive heart failure during our time
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.120]   in Pittsburgh and after having a mild stroke.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.320]   The stroke was associated with blood clot formation due to his heart not pumping very
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   efficiently.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:57.480]   Fortunately, he did not suffer any permanent physical effects from the stroke, only minor
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.040]   damage to brain tissue which temporarily affected his speech for a few weeks.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:10.720]   Gavin also continued to suffer with chronic pain which was significantly exacerbated by
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.640]   the changes in weather and barometric pressure in Pittsburgh.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.880]   Because of this, Gavin wanted to move to a warmer, more temperate climate and he picked
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.120]   Tucson, Arizona.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.600]   He asked and received permission from his company to work remotely and I resigned my
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.440]   position at Carnegie Mellon and accepted position at the University of Arizona.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:40.240]   To the academic community, this career move of mine made absolutely no sense.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.060]   Many questioned me on why I would leave a top 10 engineering program for one ranked
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.920]   at least 50 spots lower.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.040]   So this move provided plenty of opportunities to have discussions of life priorities with
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.600]   others.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   While giving up such an excellent position was difficult and certainly disruptive to
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.680]   a young career, there was no question in my mind that it was the right thing to do.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.200]   During our time in Tucson, Gavin and I were blessed with the birth of our second child,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.080]   Derek, who is here with me today.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.280]   We ended up only staying in Tucson two years.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.680]   Gavin got a new manager at PPG and this manager decided to eliminate his position.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:30.760]   So we contacted Professor Peppis at Purdue University and he and the chemical engineering
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:37.520]   department chair very quickly facilitated faculty positions at Purdue for both of us.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.800]   Gavin's position was in the Department of Organizational Leadership and Supervision
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.560]   and mine was in chemical engineering.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.480]   Gavin also thrived as a faculty member, winning best teacher awards and he also wrote a book,
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:56.500]   an economics textbook entitled Life, Love and Economics, a textbook that undergraduate
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.400]   students actually read.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.600]   This book was also featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and in Newsweek
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.440]   magazine.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.120]   By this point in my career, I was viewed as a job hopper.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.920]   I was now on my third tenure track faculty position in seven years.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.840]   Although I was well aware of how this perception might negatively impact a career, when it
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.640]   came down to it, I was really not that concerned because there were compelling family reasons
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.400]   for each move.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.500]   And being back at Purdue in Indiana was wonderful in a number of ways.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.000]   It put us closer to our families.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I was back at a top engineering school with great graduate students, was promoted to full
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.280]   professor and was given the opportunity to try out academic administration by leading
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.840]   a small freshman engineering education department with seven tenure track faculty and 20 staff.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.640]   It was at Purdue where I discovered that academic leadership was something I enjoyed and a career
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.960]   path I wanted to pursue.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.880]   After a few years at Purdue, Gavin's congestive heart failure became acute, such that he was
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:14.080]   basically suffocating and his lungs were not getting sufficient oxygen.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:21.000]   Another risky operation was undertaken, one in which a battery-operated left ventricle
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.640]   assist device would be installed to help his heart pump blood.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.880]   A couple of days before the surgery, Gavin wrote to those praying for him, "My wife and
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.800]   parents support having this surgery, and I am also guided by my favorite Bible verse,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:45.600]   Romans 8:28, 'For we know that in all things God works for the good for those who love
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.920]   him and have been called according to his purpose.'
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.880]   I realize that I just need to love God and do his will, and everything else will be taken
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.160]   care of.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.160]   If I don't make it through this surgery, that means I am in a better place, so don't feel
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.680]   bad for me."
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.480]   And I also know that since I have loved God and done his will, my wife and kids will be
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.440]   taken care of.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.880]   Gavin did not make it through the surgery, and he died on December 19, 2000, at 39 years
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.360]   of age.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.520]   I wrote to those same prayer warriors later that day, "We have had and have confidence
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.960]   no matter the outcome, Gavin is in a much better place now.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.880]   I rejoice when I think of that.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:35.040]   I trust, as Gavin said in his email, that God will take care of the rest."
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.800]   And even though I love Gavin and miss him greatly, God has taken care of the rest, as
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.040]   I will now share.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.960]   He is faithful.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.320]   After Gavin died, my mother came to live with us in Indiana for about ten months.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:56.000]   Going back to her home, she was going back to her home in Cincinnati every other weekend.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.780]   Eric was four years of age, and Jeanette was 14 at the time.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.960]   This selfless gift she gave to me was an incredible support, both emotionally and in many practical
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   ways, as you can imagine, with me now being a single mother with two young children trying
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.200]   to get into a completely new rhythm of life.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.360]   Not long after the ten months passed and my mother moved permanently back to Cincinnati,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:27.040]   I met my then future husband, Barry Curtis, at a Purdue chemical engineering alumni event.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.200]   He then volunteered to lead a strategic planning exercise for the freshman engineering department
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.680]   I led.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.560]   Barry had grown up going to church.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.520]   His parents mostly sent him to church, though, and they stayed home.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.480]   But he had stopped going by the time he was in college.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.880]   It was shortly before September of 2001 when Barry and I started working together on this
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.360]   strategic plan for that department.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:01.800]   9/11 occurred, and this event shook Barry, as it did all of us.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.200]   Discussing this event opened the door for me to have some deep conversations with him
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.280]   about various events in both his and my life, and his views on the meaning of life more
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.120]   generally.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.520]   And as he would say, I had no good answers for Jennifer's probing questions.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.080]   I also mailed Barry a copy of Gavin's book.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   I have to say that I am not the type of evangelist who, by nature, is comfortable or has much
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:37.700]   experience with witnessing to complete strangers, unlike Gavin's father, who was such a gift
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.700]   for this.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.880]   I could tell so many amazing stories.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.960]   He was truly gifted in that regard.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.640]   But as I am getting to know someone better, I am very interested in learning about that
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   person's worldview.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:55.520]   I'm into apologetics, so it is natural for me to engage in those types of discussions,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.120]   sharing my own thoughts and beliefs also.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:05.060]   Then I pray that those discussions lead future fruit in the lives of the people I speak with.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:10.320]   After many such conversations with Barry, he was open to going to church, and I checked
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.580]   out potential churches online for him to attend near where he lived in Houston and suggested
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.580]   one.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:23.200]   He started regularly attending, was convicted to repentance, and was saved in that church.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.320]   He also says that Gavin's faith and story, as related in his book, was a key factor in
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.180]   his conversion.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:34.800]   So going back to Gavin's frequent statement, "If one person comes to know Christ because
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.240]   of what I went through, it was all worth it," well, at least one of those people is
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.080]   my husband, Barry.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.640]   Incredible.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.120]   Gavin's parents embraced Barry into the family, and Gavin's dad even walked me down the
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.880]   aisle at my and Barry's wedding as my own father had passed away by that time.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.960]   Barry also formally adopted Jeanette and Derek.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.880]   As I mentioned earlier, my career was flourishing at Purdue University.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.920]   I was also receiving more invited lecture invitations, and there were more travel associated
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.240]   with my administrative duties.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.040]   To accommodate my schedule, Barry had already switched to a part-time role in his company.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.520]   Later about a year into our marriage, Barry lost that job and suggested to me that he
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.040]   stay home full-time.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.920]   That idea was a surprise to me, and frankly, took me a lot of time to get used to, as I
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.880]   had never seen that family model lived out in practice.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.800]   But it did make sense, and Barry was convinced that pausing his own career was the best thing
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.600]   for our family.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.360]   So Barry ended up taking such a career pause for about 10 years.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.880]   Since he has returned to work, he has leveraged his background in industry by serving in several
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:54.360]   university positions related to various facets of industry-university engagement.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.760]   Given my desire to continue in academic administration, I then started applying for chemical engineering
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.920]   department chair positions.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.480]   An opportunity at the University of Florida opened up, and I served in that role for five
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.000]   years, followed then by a role as Associate Dean for Research in the College of Engineering
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.600]   for three years.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.840]   In between, we had the opportunity to spend two longer-term separate sabbaticals in Australia,
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.600]   which would have been more difficult to manage if Barry had still been working.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.800]   While serving in these administrative positions, I did not teach classes, but did continue
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.120]   my research activities while supervising master's and PhD graduate students.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.160]   I then started looking for opportunities to lead an engineering college, and an opportunity
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.880]   arose at the University of California, Davis, to serve as Dean of Engineering.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.320]   And this is the position that brought me here to California.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.920]   I served as Dean of Engineering for five years, and have since returned to faculty activities,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.440]   teaching, research, and professional service for the past three years.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:58.020]   And last year, I was elected to the National Academy of Engineering with a nomination package
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:03.800]   led by none other than Professor Pappas, my lifetime mentor, who I met as an undergraduate
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.880]   45 years ago.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.480]   Last year, I was also awarded by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers the Margaret
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   Rousseau Lifetime Achievement Award for a Woman Chemical Engineer.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.240]   This award is named in honor of Dr. Rousseau, the first woman to receive a PhD in chemical
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:27.480]   engineering for her design of the first commercial penicillin production plant to mass-produce
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.520]   penicillin, which saved countless lives during World War II.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.960]   So this is a short synopsis of my life story and my career story, which as you can see
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.360]   are inextricably linked.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:47.440]   As my mother often says, "Jennifer, you have not lived a boring life.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.320]   You have had massive highs and massive lows, but it certainly hasn't been boring."
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:00.320]   And I would say that God's hand of faithfulness is clearly evident throughout all of it, both
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.880]   in my life and my career.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.160]   And why do I say God's hand of faithfulness is evident in my career?
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.880]   First of all, because of the people He has placed in my life, who have prayed, helped
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:19.180]   and encouraged me, and shared needed truths at critical times.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.720]   But most importantly, because of my Christian parents and Gavin's Christian parents, who
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.200]   modeled being a follower of Jesus in their own lives and who surrounded us with unconditional
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.080]   love and support through good times and bad.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:36.880]   I cannot imagine Gavin and me persevering through the trials we did starting at 24 years
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.560]   of age without them.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.640]   Also I cannot imagine how I would have finished my PhD without my parents' help or navigated
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.040]   the new normal for my life after Gavin's death without the help of my mother.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.960]   And in my career I had supportive manners.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:57.280]   I talked about Professor Peppis, but there is also Professor Roy Jackson, my PhD advisor,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:03.400]   who was very supportive, patient and encouraged to me as a pregnant female graduate student.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.160]   I was his first female graduate student with a sick husband.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.240]   There is also John Anderson, who was the department chair in chemical engineering at Carnegie
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.040]   Mellon when I was assistant professor.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.640]   John was a straight shooter, and he gave me frank feedback on what I was doing well and
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.760]   on areas I was not doing so well as a young faculty member.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:30.640]   The "not so well" part was hard to receive, but it was feedback I really needed to hear
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.040]   and respond to.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:37.000]   Dr. Anderson is currently serving as president of the National Academy of Engineering, and
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.760]   it was he who inducted me into the academy last year, so my interactions with him certainly
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.400]   came full circle.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.720]   Other Christian faculty and Christian campus organizations were a source of encouragement
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.320]   to me in my career.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.440]   While I was at Carnegie Mellon, the director of faculty ministries at InterVarsity, Terry
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.440]   Morrison, visited me frequently and prayed for me.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.120]   At Purdue and the University of Florida, there were many Christian faculty, and the crew
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.640]   faculty ministries there are pretty active on those campuses.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.480]   At these universities, there are also full-page inserts into the student newspaper at Easter
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:19.240]   and Christmas each year with a biblical message and a listing of Christian faculty by department.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:24.040]   Howie and Nancy Coffin, with crew at the University of Florida, were particularly supportive.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:29.440]   Nancy led five women faculty in a weekly Bible study in my office during lunch.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.800]   During my time as department chair, Howie, and an elder from my church, came to my office
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.320]   every week to pray for me.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   In my own field of chemical engineering, at the annual American Institute of Chemical
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.480]   Engineers National Meeting, there is a Christian fellowship breakfast that includes one faculty,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.080]   Christian faculty, sharing a testimony as it relates to their career.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.000]   I organized that breakfast for over 20 years, and the breakfast still continues.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.280]   It's definitely a time of encouragement.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.760]   First of all, God's faithfulness is evident in the numerous doors that were opened just
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.680]   at the right time and the right place.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.920]   For example, Gav and I were always able to secure jobs in the same location, even under
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.160]   short time frame constraints as the situation when Gav lost his job in Arizona.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.960]   God's faithfulness in my career is also evident in the provision of two Christian husbands
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.280]   who have fully supported God's calling on my life as an engineering faculty member,
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.600]   even at their own personal sacrifice.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.520]   Having lived in New Jersey, Gav and I drove an hour and 15 minutes each way for over four
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:36.080]   years to and from our products in Allentown so I could attend Princeton.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.680]   Barry paused his own career for 10 years.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.040]   Gav and Barry have reviewed and edited numerous papers, proposals, and talks, and have given
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:50.160]   me great ideas and input on a wide variety of matters in my work.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:56.560]   This faithfulness of Lord throughout my unlikely career has provided me many opportunities
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.200]   to model Christ and share my faith.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   I was encouraged early on in my career by the directory of faculty ministries at a university
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.280]   to include a statement or two about my Christian faith when I introduced myself orally to students
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.480]   at the beginning of any course I am teaching.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.200]   I have done this my entire career.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.440]   I start off these introductions with my technical background, where I went to school, my research
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.280]   expertise, sabbaticals in Australia and Germany, and my teaching expertise.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.720]   Then I talk about personal things, like where I grew up, my family, my hobbies and interests,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:37.120]   and I close with mentioning that the foundation of my life is my Christian faith, sometimes
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.760]   also mentioning involvement in church or Bible study groups.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.000]   Recently I found saying this in my self-introduction to class as an encouragement to Christian
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.560]   students at secular universities, who may have few or no interactions with Christian
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.280]   faculty during their college years.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.560]   This past quarter, for example, a Christian student emailed me midway through the course
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.940]   asking to meet.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.360]   He was having concerns about how he's going to integrate his faith with his work after
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.560]   graduation and also have a healthy family.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.600]   I shared some of my experiences and advice, as well as Pat Gelsinger's book.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.680]   Pat is the current CEO of Intel and a Christian.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.640]   The book is entitled The Juggling Act, Bringing Balance to Your Faith, Family, and Work, and
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.760]   one I highly recommend.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.920]   Also mentoring is an integral aspect of everything I do as a professor.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:35.140]   I engage with undergraduate and graduate students in the classroom and advising students and
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.960]   research activities, as well as K-12 students in outreach activities.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.320]   At my current career stage, I also serve as a mentor to junior faculty members.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.000]   In all of these situations, students, postdocs, and other faculty are observing you at all
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   times.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.640]   This is a wonderful opportunity to model Christ.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.120]   How I act in every situation during office hours, interacting with staff and faculty
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.720]   meetings conveys how I value other people who are made in the image of God.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.400]   By projecting an other-focused mindset that is genuinely interested in their educational
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.160]   or career progress, you are sought out for advice and counsel.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Frankly, I'm energized by helping others, mentoring others.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.440]   It is a privilege.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.320]   It's also a reminder to me how much others have poured into my own life over the years,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.520]   shaping my career in so many ways.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.840]   Because of both my career progression and being a female chemical engineering professor,
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:38.640]   I am frequently asked to speak to engineering students and faculty on topics relating to
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.880]   career advice and my own career journey.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:48.360]   It is very natural in these settings, when I share my somewhat unusual career path, that
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.000]   I discuss my personal life, including my Christian faith.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.520]   While I don't explicitly share the gospel message in these talks, I discuss Gavin's
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:04.480]   book, bring copies to pass out to those who want to pick up a book, and the gospel messages
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480]   in there.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:13.160]   I also have had many opportunities one-on-one to share my faith in my office or on Zoom.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.560]   The Lord has certainly been patient with my many lapses back to self-reliance, forgetting
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.520]   that I am his and made for him.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.480]   It is he who provided my passion for teaching, research, and administration, along with the
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.240]   talents and energy necessary to fulfill my professional responsibilities.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:36.160]   When I use these talents to glorify him, I please him, and his faithfulness becomes even
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.360]   more abundantly evident.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:46.080]   There is no doubt that my unlikely STEM career journey has been God's calling on my life.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:52.640]   As I was preparing this talk, the hymn "Have Thine Own Way, Lord" kept coming to my mind.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.980]   I would like to recite the lyrics to this hymn as a close to my talk.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.300]   Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.020]   Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:13.960]   Mold me and make me after thy will, while I am waiting, yielded and still.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.560]   Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.960]   Teach me and try me, master today.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:31.440]   Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now, as in thy presence humbly I bow.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.400]   Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:44.920]   Hold over my being absolute sway, filled with thy spirit till all can see, Christ only always
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.400]   living in me.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.600]   I am so very thankful for this opportunity to speak with you all and share my story.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.560]   I'd be happy to answer any questions if time allows.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:04.960]   Thank you so much for that.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.880]   I loved the encouragement to be faithful, knowing that God has the outcome in mind already.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.000]   And just your reminder that the Lord is faithful.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   That is so helpful.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.520]   Also, I cannot imagine having a new baby, first baby, and taking care of a sick husband
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.800]   and doing research.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.520]   And I think we can all relate.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:30.840]   The Lord has brought us into situations where we are weak, where we have to rely on him.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.040]   And I encourage you all to share those during lunch as well.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.520]   If anyone has any questions, please ask now.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:59.160]   We can take some questions.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:05.440]   Thank you for being so vulnerable and open about your career journey and also certain
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.800]   things like the self-reliance, I can definitely relate to that.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.280]   What's some advice that you would give?
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.040]   I think as women in science and math, we often have young women looking up to us or asking
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   us advice.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.440]   What's some advice that you would give to mentoring young women that may not be walking
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.680]   in the faith, that might be prioritizing the career to a point that you might want to give
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.240]   some guidance to, but you can't necessarily talk about it from a Christian perspective,
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.120]   if that makes sense?
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.240]   Yeah, certainly mentors have helped me.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:51.600]   I mean, looking for role models and seeking their advice.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:59.000]   Obviously I think advice from a Christian would be the best advice.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.840]   But also getting a wide variety of input and ultimately you get a lot of input, and I did
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:10.640]   early on in my career too about, oh, you should move your research in this direction or that.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:19.040]   But ultimately you have to do what fits your passion and what fits your skills.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:27.480]   So I think matching what you do with your own gifts is really the best advice that I
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.160]   can give.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:42.040]   Thank you.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.980]   Thank you so much for your talk today.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:50.760]   Kind of along those lines of mentorship as well, but as women, there's a lot of pressure.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.600]   The only real example is feminism and diversity inclusion.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.320]   So I'm curious, especially as so many of us Christian women are asked to mentor other
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.800]   young Christian women in the faith who are starting this journey, aside from the one
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:11.720]   book you had shared, what other resources have helped you think through this topic of
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:18.440]   biblical femininity in a secular workplace?
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:31.400]   I'm trying to think of specific examples I have.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.280]   In terms of your family life and combining family and work or?
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.280]   I think it can be both.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:45.560]   I think some of, definitely combining family and work is part of that from a biblical perspective
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:53.000]   as well as even just, the world says that as women to act like men in the secular workplace.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   And so aside from the Bible, not aside, but with that, I'm often asked for resources and
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.080]   I've struggled to find things to point people to of things like this testimony, which is
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   really encouraging.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.320]   And so I'm curious if you've come across anything.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:20.320]   So the family and work, I mean, the key element is your husband.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.560]   Discussion with him on how the priorities of how things are going to get done in the
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:30.760]   family and just making sure you both are in one accord.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:38.400]   And I also have got a lot of wonderful advice from successful people in my church, how they
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.400]   manage it.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.840]   And I do highly recommend that book that I mentioned.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.920]   It's full of lots of practical tips.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:53.360]   In terms of femininity at work, I mean, I never felt like I needed to act like a man.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.120]   I mean, I acted like myself.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:07.840]   I always dressed feminine and I never felt called to act anything like what I was.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:14.160]   And I felt confident, like I said, about the Lord.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.760]   If this didn't work out, something else would.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:22.640]   So I always felt like I should be myself, who I am.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   And I went with that.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:30.440]   And I always had the confidence if my, if myself was not a fit, the Lord would provide
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:35.240]   something else.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.360]   Excuse me.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:53.240]   Hello, while you were getting your doctorate completed, I under nowhere near as trying
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:58.640]   circumstances but was very much empathizing with trying to finish a doctoral program while
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.120]   being married and children and full-time work.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.640]   As you did that and you accomplished that, what might be one bit of advice that you found
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:12.320]   useful towards meeting your deadlines and getting things done?
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:20.920]   The biggest advice I would have is taking one little step at a time and not looking
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:29.760]   at the massive, what's got to be done, just each day, what am I going to accomplish?
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.440]   That inch by inch, that is the best advice.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:39.920]   And when you take that approach, things get accomplished.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.720]   Hello.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.600]   Thank you for your talk.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.240]   As a member who's in like UC faculty administration, we increasingly see, you know, the world getting
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.760]   more politicized, especially university environment.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:51:00.160]   Do you have any thoughts about the future of Christians in these very secular politicized
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.000]   environments?
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:11.840]   There is a, yeah, there's a worldview that pervades the university.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:22.600]   And as a faculty member thus far, I don't, there's not much pressure to adhere.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   I mean, you can conduct your own business pretty much the way you want.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.400]   I felt like I, and I've had opportunities to share my faith.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.840]   Even when I was dean, I was interviewing, I told the provost I was a Christian and I
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.080]   still got hired.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:46.200]   That said, it is becoming, especially since the pandemic, very, very politicized.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.880]   And in part, that was part of the reason I stepped down as dean.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:57.640]   Because when you get into these senior administrative positions, there is certainly more pressure
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:07.860]   for you to be one of the spokesperson for these kind of worldviews, which I'm just not
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.140]   comfortable with doing.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:18.680]   So my prayer though, is that some of these positions, I mean, the administration takes
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:23.000]   some of these positions because they think, but these people are lost.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.760]   They think that this is what will help students.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   And my prayer is that they see that this is not helping the students and they rethink
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.140]   some of these views.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.560]   That is my prayer.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   Thank you.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:46.380]   I have a question.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:55.840]   You mentioned some of these ways, but what are ways where that us maybe more senior faculty
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:04.180]   or can encourage mentorship, can encourage other people to come to us and making ourselves
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:11.260]   available for this kind of selfless service to these younger professionals?
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:20.140]   So my department just instituted that every student had to have a, just like when I was
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:28.880]   a freshman at Purdue, every student needs to meet with a faculty advisor, you know,
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.380]   with such frequency.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:35.560]   So students, I think a lot of students don't want to approach a faculty member.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:42.340]   So a lot of times I think we as the mentor have to reach out and set appointments with,
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.140]   Hey, I'd just like to touch base.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:48.900]   Hey, I see that you did poorly on this test.
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.900]   Certainly for me, I would have never reached out.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:58.300]   I mean, so I think the onus is a lot on us to do the reaching out, especially for undergraduate
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:03.980]   students and, you know, people in high school or middle school that may be considering STEM
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:11.460]   as a career because most of them are not comfortable to send emails to a faculty member to try
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.180]   to meet or talk.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:19.380]   So I think we have to do be, be very proactive about reaching out to them.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.380]   That's been my experience.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:27.020]   I mean, graduate students are much more comfortable, but for college age students and younger,
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:35.940]   I think most, even unless they're very confident students, they don't tend to do that.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:54.260]   Dr. Curtis, your testimony is truly inspirational and you've clearly demonstrated that God's
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:55:03.620]   grace is all sufficient in any circumstance that you find yourself and you truly have
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:10.420]   been a light shining in the darkness of this world.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:17.740]   And people saw the good works that you did through our Lord and our Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.420]   and I believe gave the glory to God.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.420]   Thank you.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:29.220]   I can't, I can't quarrel with somebody's testimony because that's a fact of what God
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:36.020]   did in your life for many, many years, demonstrates the goodness of the Lord.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.020]   I'm really so encouraged.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:44.940]   I'm so happy to be here today because kind of amazing how the Holy Spirit of God works.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:55.480]   I'm a professor of Surgical Oncology in Atlanta, but recently God has truly been speaking to
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   me.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:01.660]   I was just looking at the devotion that I share with my children.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:11.700]   It's interesting that the scripture verses that were apparent in that song you cited,
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:21.560]   "Have thy own way, Lord, have thy own way, thou art the porter and I am the clay.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:27.820]   Make me and mold me after your way," which are so, so moving.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:36.460]   I have really been meditating on that and especially the third stanza that says, "Have
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:41.300]   thy own way, Lord, have thy own way."
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:49.300]   And then goes on to say that, "Fill me with your spirit, you all shall see Christ only,
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   Christ only."
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   Just so moving.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.820]   So thank you for what you're doing.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:57:03.500]   That is what I strive to do where I am, and when you are transparent, when you are honest,
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   and when you are really, really doing what the Holy Spirit ministers you to do, it's
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:18.060]   just amazing how, what a great impact that you can have around the people that surround
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.060]   you.
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:29.860]   So I have no question, but just to tell you, but just to tell you that you are truly an
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.860]   inspiration.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:31.860]   Thank you.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:32.860]   He will be exalted.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.860]   Amen.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.860]   Amen.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   Thank you so much for...
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.540]   Let's do one more question.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.100]   Hello.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.900]   My friend and I, we drove up here.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:49.920]   We both work at Cal State San Marcos and we met in the social work program.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:54.380]   We both provide administrative support to faculty in that department.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.700]   It's a master's program.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:58:05.540]   And until Debbie started working with me about a year ago, I was silent in my views in meetings,
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:09.940]   department meetings, which were very different from my own.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:17.460]   And since Debbie came to work at the university, the first day I met her, she prayed with us
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:23.100]   at lunch and there was a faculty member there and I was just shocked, you know, like, and
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:27.540]   also very convicted because I hadn't been sharing my faith.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:34.580]   And so we have walked around the campus and prayed together for students and we see these
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:40.860]   students struggling with mental health issues while in a mental health program, right?
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:47.940]   Learning to counsel other people and it's pervasive.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:56.020]   And we see that the views that they're being taught and modeled and we're concerned.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:01.740]   So since you've been department chair and faculty, what would you say to your staff
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:08.700]   members who want to share their faith in a university that's very liberal?
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.780]   How would you, what are your thoughts on that?
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.780]   I mean, I think there are many opportunities.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:22.700]   I have to say like in a department meeting or larger groups, these meetings for some
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.740]   other purpose, I don't tend to share my faith in that.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:31.140]   But certainly on one and one, I mean, there are many opportunities for one-on-one.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:37.180]   And as I was thinking, you know, people see you as someone that they can trust or maybe
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:44.260]   they might look up to, they will come to you one-on-one and these are perfect opportunities
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.940]   to share.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:51.300]   And that's the key way, but there are also little things that happen.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:59.260]   I remember one time we were reviewing graduate applications and one of the students in their
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:06.260]   statement of purpose said that they want to go to graduate school to share their, this
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.260]   is God's calling.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.660]   They want to share their faith.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.620]   And I did not say this actually, there was another Christian faculty in my department
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.940]   said, and they were saying, oh, you know, the other faculty, well, we don't like this.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:22.940]   And I said, well, he said something to the effect that I think there's certainly other
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.220]   things that we can be concerned about in this application.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.780]   And he got accepted.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:38.060]   So just sometimes one person to speak up about a specific topic, I think can be very effective.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.900]   And I've seen many little examples like that, but certainly one-on-one.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.940]   And like I say, I share my faith to large groups when asked to speak about my career
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:53.540]   journey, because I cannot share, it's impossible for me to share a career journey without sharing
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:57.140]   my personal and faith journey, it's impossible.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:01.940]   So it's a natural setting, I've never had any issue.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:08.860]   The only time I ever had an issue in my career was these faculty ads I mentioned.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:14.020]   And when I was at the University of Florida, every faculty member had a bulletin board
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:19.040]   outside their office door, and people put all manners of things on there.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:27.440]   So I posted the ad, and I had one faculty complain about the ad not being there.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:33.480]   And I called up, I think it was Heritage Foundation or something to see if I was legally fine
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.160]   to do that, and I certainly was.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.840]   And my department chair, who was not even a Christian, supported me to have that there.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.880]   But I prayed about it, and after a while, I decided to take it down, even though I didn't
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.300]   legally need to do that.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:02:01.440]   But that was the only time that I've ever had any issues with sharing in different contexts.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.840]   So I think there are opportunities in a secular environment to do it.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
