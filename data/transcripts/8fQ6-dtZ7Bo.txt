[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   There's a long history, dating back really prior to the 1950s, of scientists doing experiments
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.440]   on themselves.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.880]   Not because they are reckless, but because they want the exact sorts of information that
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880]   you're talking about.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.380]   The ability to really understand how intention and awareness of goals can shape outcomes
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.380]   in biology.
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.360]   And if that is vague to people listening, what I mean here is that for many, probably
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.280]   hundreds of years, if not longer, scientists have taken the drugs they've studied, or stimulated
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.640]   their own brain, or done things to really try and get a sense of what the animals they
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.440]   work on or the patients they work on might be experiencing.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.120]   Psychiatrists are sort of famous for this, by the way.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.880]   I'm not pointing fingers at anybody, but psychiatrists are known to try the drugs that they administer.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.440]   And some people would probably imagine that's a good thing, just so that the clinicians
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.860]   could have empathy for the sorts of side effects and not-so-great effects of some of these
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.380]   drugs that they administer to patients.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:12.680]   But the confidence test I present you is, would you be willing, or are you willing,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.760]   if allowed, to have these electrodes implanted into your motor cortex?
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.260]   You're not a quadriplegic.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.980]   You can move your limbs.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.060]   But given the state of the technology at Neuralink now, would you do that?
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.580]   Or maybe in the next couple of years, if you were allowed, would you be willing to do that
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.500]   and be the person to say, hey, turn up the stimulation over there?
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.180]   I feel like I want to reach for the cup with that robotic arm, but I'm feeling some resistance.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.420]   Because it's exactly that kind of experiment done on a person who can move their limbs
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.660]   and who deeply understands the technology and the goals of the experiment that I would
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.060]   argue actually stands to advance the technology fastest, as opposed to putting the electrodes
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.020]   first into somebody who is impaired at a number of levels and then trying to think about why
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.060]   things aren't working.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.000]   And again, this is all with the goal of reversing paralysis in mind.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.100]   But would you implant yourself with these microelectrodes?
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.380]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.580]   I would be excited to do that.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.580]   I think for the first iteration of the device, it probably wouldn't be very meaningful.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.620]   It wouldn't be very useful, because I can still move my limbs.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.540]   And our first outputs from this are things that I can do just as easily with my hands,
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.540]   right?
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.680]   Moving a mouse, typing on a keyboard.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.780]   We are necessarily making this device as a medical device, for starters, for people with
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.020]   bad medical problems and no good options.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.640]   It wouldn't really make sense for an able-bodied person to get one in the near term.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.020]   As the technology develops and we make devices specifically designed to perform functions
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.860]   that can't be done even by an able-bodied person, say, eventually refine the technique
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.300]   to get to the point where you can type faster with your mind and one of these devices than
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.580]   you can with text-to-speech or speech-to-text and your fingers, that's a use case that makes
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.640]   sense for someone like me to get it.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.100]   It doesn't really make sense for me to get one when it allows me to use a mouse slightly
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.140]   worse than I can with my hand currently.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.220]   That said, the safety of the device, I would absolutely vouch for.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.280]   From the hundreds of surgeries that I've personally done with this, I think it's much safer than
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.900]   many of the industry-standard FDA-approved surgeries that I routinely do on patients
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.060]   that no one even thinks twice about their standard of care.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.820]   Neuralink has already reached, in my mind, a safety threshold that is far beyond a commonly
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.100]   accepted safety threshold.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.300]   Along the lines of augmenting one's biological function or functions in the world, I think
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.260]   now's the appropriate time to talk about the small lump present in the top of your hand.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:23.260]   For those listening, not watching, it looks like a small lump between Dr. McDougal's forefinger
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.660]   and thumb or index finger and thumb placed on skin on the top of his hand.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.020]   You've had this for some years now because we've known each other for, gosh, probably
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.020]   seven years now or so, and you've always had it in the time that I've known you.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.580]   What is that lump and why did you put it in there?
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.620]   It's a small writable RFID tag.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.620]   What's an RFID?
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.100]   What does RFID stand for?
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.100]   Yeah, radio frequency identification.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.180]   It's just a very small implantable chip that wireless devices can temporarily power.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.700]   If you approach an antenna, they can power and send a small amount of data back and forth.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.540]   Most phones have the capability of reading and writing to this chip.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.340]   For years, it let me into my house.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.660]   It unlocked a deadbolt on my front door.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.700]   For some years, it unlocked the doors at Neuralink and let me through the various locked doors
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.020]   inside the building.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.020]   It is writable.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.380]   I can write a small amount of data to it.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:42.060]   For some years in the early days of crypto, I had a crypto private key written on it to
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.700]   store a cryptocurrency that I thought was a dead offshoot of one of the main cryptocurrencies
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.820]   after it had forked.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.940]   I put the private wallet key on there and forgot about it and remembered a few years
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.980]   later that it was there and went and checked and it was worth a few thousand dollars more
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.460]   than when I had left it on there.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.500]   That was a nice finding change in the sofa in the 21st century.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.100]   When you say you read it, you're essentially taking a phone or other device and scanning
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:18.400]   it over the lump in your hand, so to speak, and then it can read the data from there essentially.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.220]   What other sorts of things could one put into these RFIDs in theory?
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.820]   How long can they stay in there before you need to take them out and recharge them or
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.180]   replace them?
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.180]   These are passive.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.180]   They're coated in biocompatible glass and as an extra, I'm a rock climber and so I was
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.820]   worried about that glass shattering during rock climbing.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.020]   I additionally coated them in another ring of silicone before implanting that.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.180]   It's pretty safe.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.180]   They're passive.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.180]   There's no battery.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.180]   There's no active electronics in them.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.500]   They could last the rest of my life.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.020]   I don't think I'd ever have to remove it for any reason.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:02.540]   At some point, the technology is always improving, so I might remove it and upgrade it.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.540]   That's not inconceivable.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.040]   Already, there's 10X more storage versions available.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:16.280]   That could be a drop-in replacement for this if I ever remove it, but it has a small niche
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.020]   use case and it's an interesting proof of concept tiptoeing towards the concept that
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.000]   you mentioned of you have to be willing to go through the things that you're suggesting
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.920]   to your patients in order to say with a straight face that you think this is a reasonable thing
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.800]   to do.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   A small subcutaneous implant in the hand is a little different than a brain implant.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.640]   What's involved in getting that RFID chip into the hand?
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   I'm assuming it's an outpatient procedure.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.640]   Presumably, you did it on yourself.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.600]   This was a kitchen table kind of procedure.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.560]   Any anesthetic or no?
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.000]   I've seen people do this with a lidocaine injection.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.440]   For my money, I think a lidocaine injection is probably as painful as just doing the procedures.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   Just a little cut in that thin skin on the top of the hand.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.600]   Some people are cringing right now.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   Other people are saying, "I want one," because you'll never have to worry about losing your
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.840]   keys or passwords.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.120]   I actually would like it for passwords, because I'm dreadfully bad at remembering passwords.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.440]   I have to put them in places all over the place.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.280]   I'm like that kid in – remember that movie, Stand By Me, where the kid hides the pennies
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.800]   under the porch and then loses the map?
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.360]   Spends all summer trying to find them.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   I can relate.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.560]   Yeah, so it was just a little slit and then put in there.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.240]   No local immune response, no pus, no swelling.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.120]   All the materials are completely biocompatible.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.440]   They're on the surface, exposed to the body, so no bad reaction.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.960]   It healed up in days and it was fine.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   Very cool.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.480]   Since we're on video here, can you just maybe raise it and show us?
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:01.320]   Were you not to point out that little lump, I wouldn't have known to ask about it.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.560]   Any other members of your family have these?
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.280]   A few years after having this and seeing the convenience of me being able to open the door
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.000]   without keys, my wife insisted that I put one in her as well, so she's walking around
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   with one.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Fantastic.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.760]   We consider them our version of wedding rings.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:25.960]   [music]
