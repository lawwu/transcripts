[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Well, we all want our prayers to work.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.160]   So what prayers are guaranteed to work?
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.220]   In discovering which prayers are effective, we can start with Jesus' astonishing promise
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.880]   to all of us in John 15, 7.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.320]   Here's his pledge to his followers.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.680]   "If you abide in me," Jesus says, "and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.680]   and it will be done for you.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   Ask whatever you wish."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.440]   What an astonishing, open-ended promise to boost our prayer lives.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.560]   But it's given parameters by what makes for an effective prayer life.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.920]   Did you catch that?
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.480]   If my word abides in you.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.560]   John Piper preached a sermon on this text back in the early weeks of 1993 in a sermon
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.440]   fitly titled "Ask Whatever You Wish."
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.720]   It led to this great clip where he explained the key to an effective prayer life.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.920]   Here's Pastor John about 30 years ago.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.280]   Prayer is for granting us the joy of seeing God's will executed through us as it becomes
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.540]   our will.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.700]   The only joy in life that lasts is when our desires are drawn from his desires, and those
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.640]   desires are the ones that have the promise made, "Ask and it will be given you."
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.800]   Here's the way John put it in chapter 3, verse 22 of his first letter.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.200]   "Whatever you ask, you receive from him because you keep his commandments and do the things
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.280]   that are pleasing in his sight."
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.960]   Prayer is not for gratifying natural desires.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.720]   Prayer is given as a gift for the joy and the satisfaction of those people whose heart
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.160]   is so in tune with God that they keep his commandments and do what is pleasing to him.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.680]   If you have no interest in obeying God, in bringing your whole of life, your attitude
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.960]   from morning to night into conformity to his values and getting your desires from his desires,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.440]   prayer is not your business.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:11.240]   James put it like this, "You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.960]   so that you may spend it on your pleasures."
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   And then he calls them adulteresses in the next verse.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.600]   Know why?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.120]   Adulteresses, picturing the church as a wife, God as the husband, and prayer as asking the
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.200]   husband for money to pay the paramour down the hall with which he sleeps.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.720]   That's a pretty ugly view of prayer, isn't it?
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:49.640]   Prayer is to bring our lives into conformity with the desires of our husband, God, not
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.600]   to ask him for the wherewithal to consort with the world.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.040]   Prayer is not for the satisfying and gratifying of natural desires until those natural desires
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.720]   come into the service of the hallowing of God's name, the seeking of God's kingdom,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.900]   and the doing of God's will.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.720]   The words of Jesus abiding in us prepare us for fruit-bearing prayer.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.300]   The words of Jesus abiding in us prepare us for fruit-bearing prayer.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.680]   If prayer is not for the gratifying of our natural desires but for fruit-bearing for
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.600]   God, then the major challenge before us at the beginning of 1993 in prayer is becoming
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   the kind of people who are not dominated by natural desires.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.760]   That is the major challenge in prayer, becoming the kind of people who are not dominated by
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.920]   natural desires but who are dominated by spiritual desires, what Paul calls ceasing to be a natural
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.040]   person and becoming a spiritual person or growing beyond being carnal people to being
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.560]   spiritual people, people who of course we want to eat, of course we'd like to succeed,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.640]   of course we want clothes on our back and a roof over our head and education for our
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.760]   children.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.680]   But if those things are not subordinate in our lives to the big issues that make us tick,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.400]   then we're not going to pray with success.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.000]   We're not.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   Prayer is going to be so worldly, so earthly, so unspiritual, God will wonder what does
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.720]   it have to do with Him.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.220]   If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, you will become that kind of person and whatever
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.520]   you wish, it will be done for you.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   Let me give you some examples of how the Word of Jesus abiding within makes you that kind
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.320]   of person in order that you might pray.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.240]   First John 1.10, "If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His Word is not in
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   us."
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.040]   Meaning, if His Word were in us, we'd know ourselves a right.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.400]   The key to a humble, proper assessment of who we are before God comes one way, by the
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.560]   Word of God dwelling within.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.960]   And without that proper self-assessment, we will not be in tune with God and know how
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.400]   to pray according to His will.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.520]   Number two, John 17.8, Jesus says, "They have received My words and have truly understood
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.560]   that I came forth from thee."
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.720]   In other words, the Word received and abiding is the key to unlock not only a true knowledge
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   of ourselves in humility, but an exalted knowledge of God and His Son, Jesus, coming from Him.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.680]   And we cannot pray a right until we know Jesus as He is.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.080]   We can't pray a right until we have an exalted view of the meaning of the coming of the Son
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.040]   into the world.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.560]   Number three, 1 John 2.14 says, "I have written to you, young men, because the Word of God
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.720]   abides in you and you have overcome the evil one."
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.280]   Unless the Word of God is abiding in us, Satan will dominate, he will control, and he will
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.700]   deceive and bring us into odds with God rather than being in tune with God.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.880]   In order to pray in tune with God, Satan must be defeated, and he was defeated in the young
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:44.240]   men in Ephesus and the other churches by the abiding of the Word of God.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:53.520]   Number four, John 14.24, "He who does not love Me does not keep My words."
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:03.480]   Which means that the words of Jesus define the path of love.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:12.200]   We cannot pray fruit-bearing prayers until we know the path on which the fruit is born,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.900]   and the fruit is always born in the path of love and not outside that path.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.340]   If you want to know the path of love along which prayers are answered, namely the path
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.560]   of love, you must have the Word of God abiding within you.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.800]   You can't know what love is any other way than by the Word of God.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.960]   John says, "By this we know that we love God when we keep His commandments."
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.360]   You may think you're loving God by not checking into the Bible at all.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.120]   How many articles, how many books do I read today where the concepts of mercy, compassion,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:55.680]   and love are used as criteria with no defense that that's the way God sees things at all?
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.220]   No defense that this is God's view of love, God's view of mercy, God's view of compassion.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.160]   You just take the word right out of the mouth.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.380]   Since it's a politically correct word, it works.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.160]   It doesn't really matter whether it comes from God.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.000]   If you want to know the path of love, you must have the Word of God abiding in you,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.640]   because many things look loving which are not loving.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:27.200]   Chapter 5, John 8, 47, "He who is of God hears the words of God."
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   Note that.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.480]   "He who is of God hears the words of God.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.900]   For this reason you do not hear Him because you are not of God."
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.320]   What that means is, if you hear God, receive the words of God, and have His Word abiding
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:54.440]   in you, it is evidence that you are of God, that is chosen of God, born of God, elect.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.920]   In other words, the whole issue of assurance is riding on this word.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.000]   When you go to pray, one of the great hindrances to prayer and faith and hope in prayer is,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.960]   "Am I of God?
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.200]   Am I born of God?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.160]   Am I in the family?
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.280]   How do I know I'm in the family?"
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.800]   This text says you know you're in the family if you hear the Word of God, if you receive
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.000]   the Word of God, if the Word of God comes home and finds a place in you that receives
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.800]   affirmation and a "yes" and an "amen."
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:40.980]   And finally, John 15, 3, "You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.980]   to you."
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.440]   And John 17, 17, "Sanctify them in the truth, your word is truth."
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.560]   So we have cleanness and we have sanctification coming to us through the Word.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.520]   There are a lot of other examples of how the Word abiding in us fits us to pray, but here
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.520]   are six.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.200]   A humble view of ourselves, an exalted view of the Savior, triumph over the devil, knowledge
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:12.400]   of the path of love, assurance of our election, and the power of holiness.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:20.280]   Those six and many more come to us by having the Word of God abide with us, abide in us,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:27.080]   and therefore fit us for being the kind of people who will pray in tune with God and
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.680]   hear the promise, "Whatever you ask, it will be done for you."
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   So powerful.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.280]   And notice again, put in the negative, "If you have no interest in obeying God and bringing
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.800]   your whole life into conformity to His values and getting your desires from His desires,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   prayer is not your business."
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   Wow.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.080]   "Pray according to His will, thy will be done."
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.880]   That was from John Piper's sermon on John 15, 7, titled, "Ask Whatever You Wish."
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   He preached it on January 10, 1993.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.080]   Well, if you have a sermon clip to share with us, email me.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.280]   Give me your name, current city, the sermon title, and timestamp of where the clip happens
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.200]   in the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.680]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.800]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:24.560]   Well, are rich Christians commanded to downgrade their living standards?
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.340]   Are rich Christians commanded to downgrade their living standards?
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.680]   It is a really great question.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we are Rejoined in Studio with Pastor John.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.600]   For that on Friday, we'll see you then.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   [END]
