[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.720]   - Well, pride is a dangerous sin.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.260]   It's one of the seven deadly sins.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.320]   So when you're a notable person who gets noticed
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.200]   and approached by strangers in restaurants and in airports,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.400]   how do you stay humble?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.240]   This was a question asked of Pastor John
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.380]   at the Desiring God National Conference in October of 2010.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.160]   And to raise the stakes a little bit higher,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.560]   Pastor John had just been presented with a festrift.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.120]   It was a large book published in his honor
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.680]   as a surprise gift.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.260]   It's titled "For the Fame of His Name."
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.200]   And in the context of a panel discussion at the conference,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.180]   here's how Pastor John answered the question
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960]   of how to stay humble when God is blessing your ministry.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.360]   - Oh my.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.400]   Probably the first thing to say is that
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   God is in charge of keeping his people humble, not us.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.000]   The Bible does say,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720]   "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.380]   but as in almost all other things,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.160]   command what you will and give what you command."
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   So you may, I think, expect that God will deal roughly
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.660]   with you if he has to in order to remind you
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.240]   that you're not God and that you are desperately
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.640]   in need of him.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.640]   And perhaps it's no accident that I received this book
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.640]   of essays in the middle of a leave of absence,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.560]   taken because of pain.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.000]   Got an accident?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.920]   That it worked out that way?
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.880]   They've been working on it for three years?
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240]   And that there are issues in my family,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.800]   in my wider family, in my soul,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.600]   that are such that I wanted to step back
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.000]   and look at all of them and work on all of them.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.640]   That wasn't my idea to do this.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.400]   It was things that come up.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.440]   I felt as I sat there,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.480]   these folks don't know me well enough.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.400]   (laughs)
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.560]   And they don't.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.040]   They don't know what goes on in our living room
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.620]   and bedroom and kitchen.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.920]   And so you know, and your wife knows,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   and your children know,
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   and you feel a sense of disjunction between public praise
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.940]   and private imperfections.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.140]   And that's God's doing, that he performs that.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.540]   Then there are these natural limitations
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.300]   that the people closest around me know that I have.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.620]   And I don't know why God has been pleased
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.620]   to release influence through me the way he has
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580]   when I look at the limitations.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.620]   I can't read faster than I can talk.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.940]   Everybody thinks I'm a scholar.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.260]   I'm not a scholar.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.340]   (laughs)
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.180]   I feel like they're gonna wake up and say,
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.900]   "What did we just do?"
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.740]   (audience laughs)
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.020]   I have learned to navigate my limitations
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.620]   and just do the few things I can do as well as I can.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.140]   And I'm always thinking about what I can't do.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.700]   I just wake up in the morning and think what I can't do.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   So God, I think, fits us with weaknesses.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.620]   He leads us through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.620]   He leads us in his providence, yes, even in and out of sin,
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.860]   and does what he has to do to break us.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.020]   So that's the first principle.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.940]   God is in charge of keeping us humble,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.220]   and he loves us so much, Hebrews 12,
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.820]   that if you are a child and you are not yet disciplined,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.020]   you may be a bastard.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.620]   Those are strong words.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.540]   If you haven't been spanked hard enough to come to blood,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.060]   then maybe you're not even a child.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.740]   So that's the way he works.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.340]   The second thing I would say is that,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.660]   I'll just leave it at two.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.140]   Let's say it big, then let's say it focused.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.220]   We here, we leaders here,
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.220]   believe in a certain vision of God's sovereign grace.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.100]   There's not a thing in you or me
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.500]   that inclined God to choose you for himself.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.580]   Nothing.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.620]   There's not a thing in you that inclined God
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.660]   to cause you to be born again.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.500]   Nothing.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.340]   There's not a thing in you
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.540]   that secures your eternal destiny.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.660]   Nothing.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.700]   It is totally free.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.260]   This is our theology.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.300]   Unconditional election, unconditional regeneration,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.660]   unconditional propitiation,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.860]   conditional justification, faith.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.020]   And that's a gift.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.340]   Our theology is meant to flatten us.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.420]   1 Corinthians 1, 29 and 30.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.300]   All these things, not many of you were wise,
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.900]   not many of you were high born.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.740]   Why?
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.980]   So that no one would boast in the presence of God.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.740]   Let him who boasts finish it.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.140]   That's weak.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.020]   - Boast of the Lord.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.180]   - Because not all of you are there.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.420]   Let him who boasts boast in the Lord
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.060]   that no flesh might boast in the presence of God.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.100]   Salvation is designed in a way
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.940]   as to cut the legs out from under all human boasting.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.100]   It's designed that way.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.020]   That's what this conference is about.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.140]   That's what the New Calvinism is about.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.460]   It's about smashing human pride
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.220]   and getting glory for God.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.820]   Now I said, that's the big picture.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.500]   The narrow picture is Christ crucified.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.580]   What the most important event in human history
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.940]   is the death of the Son of God.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.580]   What's the meaning of the death of the Son of God?
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.980]   It means I am unspeakably lost.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.340]   It took that much to save me.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.700]   Anybody that lives near the cross
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   isn't gonna put his thumbs in his armpits and strut.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.660]   Not gonna brag about his stuff.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.860]   Not gonna talk a lot about his achievements.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.180]   He's just looking at that incredible horror
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.500]   and saying, that's how corrupt I am.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.900]   And the cross has another message.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.300]   It's good news.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.780]   That's how much I'm loved.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.580]   And it's free.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.620]   The biggest challenge theologically
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.220]   and experientially for us is to feel loved
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.020]   unworthily.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.100]   They get up in the morning, be thrilled to be alive
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.380]   and to be thrilled to know God totally undeservingly.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.420]   That's the challenge.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.860]   Because I'm wired to want to feel thrilled
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.460]   because I got a book
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:00.860]   or had a conference or gave a message.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.220]   The constant clawing at my ego
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.940]   to find my meaning and my significance
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.620]   in other people's reckoning of what I've done.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.340]   So these guys have set me up terribly.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.180]   Right?
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:20.140]   But like David said, you deal with it.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:26.260]   So you're watching me just process this thing.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.700]   So those three things,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.820]   God is gonna do it whether you want him to or not.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.780]   He's just gonna flatten you.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.220]   Your marriage may shatter totally
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.540]   or already did, right?
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.260]   Or your kids are gonna just go wacko on you.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.300]   Or you're gonna get cancer.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   Or you're gonna lose your job.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.380]   He'll do whatever he has to do.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.020]   Just flatten you so that you are desperate before him.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.620]   And then secondly, he's gonna work
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.060]   through a conference like this
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.100]   and books here and there and movements
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.620]   to get you a theology.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.300]   With him so massively at the center,
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.140]   it never occurred to you to put yourself there.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.220]   And then he's gonna take you to the cross
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.740]   over and over and over again
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.780]   to remind you how unsavable you are
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.380]   apart from that horrific crucifixion
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.020]   and how much you are amazingly loved.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.700]   Something like that.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.260]   (audience applauding)
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260]   - Amen, it all goes back to the cross.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.700]   This excerpt was taken from the speaker panel
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.060]   at the Desiring God 2010 National Conference.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.460]   And the book I mentioned earlier
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.220]   that was presented as a surprise gift
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.460]   to Pastor John at the conference
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.620]   is titled For the Fame of God's Name,
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.140]   Essays in Honor of John Piper.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.100]   And you can download the book free of charge at our site,
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.020]   desiringgod.org/books.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.140]   And there you can find it.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.180]   The title again is For the Fame of God's Name,
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.620]   Essays in Honor of John Piper.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.160]   This excellent audio clip was sent to us
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.980]   by listener Rebecca Kim.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.340]   Thank you, Rebecca, for this clip.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.580]   And we're gonna be back tomorrow.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.700]   We're gonna talk about parenting tomorrow.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.560]   Does Proverbs promise us that if we raise our kids right,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.060]   they will not fall away from the faith as adults?
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.660]   John Piper will respond tomorrow.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.780]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.380]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:41.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
