[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets, and
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   today we continue our show on how to invest in your children at an early age. This is
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   part two in this series. I'm a big believer in the value of investing in children at an
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   early age, and I want to give you specific ideas and strategies as to how to accomplish
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   that.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now, the first episode of this series was one in which I focused primarily on what is
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   probably for many of us something that's already done, right? Our selection of a spouse and
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   the contributions that we and our spouse make to our children. Because at the end of the
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   day, a significant component of your children's long-term success is going to be driven quite
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   literally by simply who their parents are. And I spent quite a lot of time talking about
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   who their parents are in terms of their basic genetic material, which is going to drive
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   what our children look like, some of the basics of their health, etc., as well as their
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   cognitive ability, and in terms of the culture that the child's parents are from. Is the
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   child going to be raised in a culture where he has good role models, where he's going
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   to be loved and cared for, etc.?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So now we move on and we continue in the earliest stages, and I want to talk about those
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   things that can be done in the very earliest stage of the child's life. Prior to, during,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and following conception. Because this is where that raw genetic material of a parent's
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   body and a parent's life is brought into reality, is brought into being, is at the
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   moment of conception. Now, the primary opportunity that we have relating to setting our children
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   up for long-term success is related to good health. A strong and healthy baby is generally
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   produced by strong and healthy mothers and fathers, who continue to be strong and healthy,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   especially, of course, the mother, after the time of conception. And this is something
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   that we don't talk a lot about, but I believe that it is something that is extremely important
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and it's something that all of us can impact to some degree or another. Now, perhaps you've
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   already chosen your spouse, you're not changing anything there, you're not going to go out
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   on the marketplace and say, "Well, let me just pick another beautiful person that's
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   going to have, you know, another person with whom I'm going to have a designer baby."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So you're married to the person that you're married to, and that's settled, but you're
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   going to have a baby, and you hope to have a baby. What can you do to invest into your
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   child? The biggest thing you can do is going to be based upon health and nutrition. We're
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   going to begin with nutrition. In yesterday's podcast, I shared with you some ideas from
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   the excellent book called Deep Nutrition by, I think it's Katherine Shanahan, and I want
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   to read a little bit of what she has to offer from the perspective of how to invest in nutrition
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   prior to conception, and then, of course, during pregnancy. This is not something that
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   is commonly talked about in our modern world, although I think we do understand it to a
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   greater degree than before. I don't really know a pregnant mother who doesn't take some
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   prenatal vitamins, for example. But I think there's a lot more that we could do if we
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   were very interested in this, and there's a lot more that we probably should do in order
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   to supercharge the long-term benefits for our children. In the book Deep Nutrition,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   the author talks extensively in the very beginning about the history of studying good health
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and scientific research. I want to read a couple of comments in terms of traditional
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   cultures. It's very important that we go and we study traditional cultures. Of course,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   here, the researcher and dentist, American dentist Weston A. Price is probably the most
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   famous figure. But we need to go and study from what our ancestors did in order to understand
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   why what they did worked, because all of us are the recipients of a long line of genetic
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   investment. And it's extremely important to understand that what we do matters. In
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   our modern age, we've been infected with the idea that all sicknesses are caused by
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   germs, that all illnesses can be treated with a pill, and we neglect doing some of the
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   fundamental things that can drive good health. So listen to a little bit of historical analysis
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and we'll get some specific examples of what mothers and fathers can do prior to the
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   conception of their children in order to invest heavily into your child. During a historical
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   comment from chapter one of this book of Weston A. Price and some of his data, here is an
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   excerpt. "If you believe Price's data, which I do, then clearly our bodies appear
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   to be accustomed to a far richer stream of nutrients than we manage to sip, chew, swallow,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   or scarf down in our daily diets. Our need for nutrients is apparently quite extraordinary.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   But what is more extraordinary is the totality to which indigenous cultures, and presumably
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   also our ancestors, involved themselves in the production of these foods. In contrast
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   to our general attitude of nourishment as a necessary evil demanding expediency, traditional
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   life seemed to revolve around collecting and concentrating nutrition. To this end, no methodology
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and no recipe was too bizarre." I will include here a few examples from Price's book to
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   demonstrate how fully people immersed themselves in the production of food, and a few of the
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   wonderful ingenuities that streamlined this undertaking. In the Scottish Isles, people
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   built their houses using chiefly, the grass that grew abundantly on the moors. The roofs
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   were loosely woven and chimneyless so that the smoke from their cooking fires would pass
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   directly through the thatch. When the roof was removed and rebuilt in the spring after
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   having been infused with mineral-rich ash all winter, the smoke thatch made fantastic
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   fertilizer for their plant crops, chiefly oats. Their oats, in turn, were superior sources
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   of minerals and were incorporated into many dishes. One of the most important was a fish
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   dish made from a baked cod's head, rich in essential fatty acids, that had been stuffed
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   with oatmeal, rich in minerals, and chopped cod livers, rich in vitamins. On the other
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   side of the world, in Melanesia, the original arrivals to the islands had brought with them
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   a member of the pig family bred for its self-sufficiency, at finding forage in the muddy and mountainous
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   landscape. They'd released their hogs into the wild so they could colonize the forests.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Soon, the hogs' numbers had grown to the point that one would be hunted down just about
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   anywhere. Every part of the quarry, from snout to tail, would be cooked or smoked or otherwise
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   prepared and eaten. It goes on and gives some other interesting examples, but let's focus
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   on our children. As focused as people were on the production of healthy food, the chief
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   crop and the ultimate prize was the next generation of healthy children. Traditional cultures
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   made a science of it. As we'll see in Chapter 5, Step 1 was planning ahead. Around the world,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   traditions reflected extensive use of special foods to boost a woman's nutrition before
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   conception, during gestation, for nursing, and for rebuilding before the next pregnancy.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Some cultures thought it prudent to fortify the groom's diet in preparation for his wedding
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   ceremony. The shreds of surviving information suggest such knowledge was quite sophisticated.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Blackfoot Nation women utilized the still-unknown nutrient systems found in the lining of the
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   large intestine of buffalo, and later cow, to "make the baby have a nice round head."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   To ensure easy delivery, many cultures reinforced preconception and pregnancy diets with fish
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   eggs and organ meats loaded with fat-soluble vitamins, B12, and omega-3, as well as special
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   grains carefully cultivated to be high in important minerals. The Maasai allowed couples
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   to marry only after spending several months consuming milk from the wet season, when the
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   grass was especially lush and the milk much denser in nutrients. In Fiji, islanders would
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   hike miles down to the sea to acquire a certain species of lobster crab that "tribal custom
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   demonstrated to be particularly efficient for producing a highly perfect infant."
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Elsewhere, fortifying foods didn't just facilitate pregnancy; they made the difference
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   between the baby making it to term or not. The soil of certain areas around the Nile
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Delta is notoriously low in iodine, the lack of which can lead to maternal goiter and infant
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   malformation. Local tribes knew that burning water hyacinth, rich in iodine, produced ashes
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   capable of preventing these complications. These ingrained traditions existed throughout
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   the world and, until recently, dictated the ebb and flow of daily life. This kind of dedication,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   study, and wise use of natural resources is what was required to amass and protect the
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   genetic wealth that enabled people to survive in a very different and harsher wild, wild
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   world. Of course, these days most of us spend our time fighting traffic, not wild boar,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   but the same nutritional input that toughened and fortified the physiologies of these indigenous
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   peoples can still be accessed today for the attainment of extraordinary health. Were the
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   medical community to bring the same enthusiasm to the engineering and maintenance of healthy
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   bodies as archaeologists bring to their study of ancient architectural wonders, they would
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   soon call for a radical revision of what we understand to be a healthy human diet. The
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   construction of a beautiful, sound building is not a matter of chance, but of planning,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   good materials, and reference to the collected body of relevant science. Winning the genetic
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   lottery depends upon those very same prerequisites. Today, at every stage in the process of producing
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   food, we do things differently than our sturdy, self-sufficient ancestors did, wasting opportunities
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   to provide ourselves with essential nutrients at every turn. We fail to fortify and protect
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   the substrate on which the life and health of everything depends, the soil. We raise
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   animals in unspeakably inhumane and unhealthy conditions, fill their tissues with toxins,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and color the meat to make it appear more appetizing. Being raised on open pasture is
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   no guarantee that an animal's body, an ultimate sacrifice, will be put to full use. Typically,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   only the muscle is consumed. Much of the nutrients, bioconcentrated over the animal's life, are
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   thrown to waste. Grains, even those grown on relatively healthy soil, are too often
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   processed in ways specifically damaging to the most essential and delicate nutrients.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Once in the kitchen, the consumer takes one last swing at whatever nutrition has survived
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   through overcooking and the use of cheap, toxic oils. Finally, since we've not been
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   told that certain vitamins and minerals are more bioavailable when combined with acids
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   or fats, many of them pass right through us. Given that we drop the ball at every stage
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   in the process of bringing food to the table, it's not surprising that recent studies
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   show far from exceeding the RDA, as we should be (RDA is recommended daily allowance),
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   few of us even meet it. For vitamin A, only 46.7% of healthy females meet the RDA, and
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   levels are low in 87% of children with asthma. For vitamin D, 55% of obese children, 76%
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   of minority children, and 36% of otherwise healthy young adults are deficient. For vitamin
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   E, 58% of toddlers between 1 and 2 years old, 91% of preschoolers, and 72.3% of healthy
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   females do not consume enough. 0% of breastfed infants were found to have achieved the minimum
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   recommended intake of vitamin K. For the B vitamins, only 54.7% consumed adequate B2,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   riboflavin, for folate. Only 2.2% of women between the ages of 18 and 35, and 5.2% of
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   women aged 36 to 50 achieved the recommended intake. And for calcium, fewer than 22% of
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   African American adolescent girls consumed the RDA. There are more studies, but you get
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   the idea. Not one study shows 100% adequacy of any single nutrient, not to mention adequacy
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   of all measurable nutrients, which would be a better goal.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Presumably, the vast majority of Americans are deficient in multiple nutrients. Many
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   of my patients suffer from symptoms that could be attributable to poor nutrition. Problems
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   as common as dry skin, easy bruising, frequent runny noses, yeast infections, and crampy
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   digestive systems are all exacerbated by, if not due entirely to, inadequate nutrition.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Unfortunately, testing for vitamin adequacy is not easy. We haven't even defined what
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   normal levels are for many nutrients, including essential fatty acids and vitamin K. For those
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   that have been so defined, the normal range may extend all the way down to zero. That's
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   right, you may have none of an essential nutrient in your bloodstream, yet still be considered
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   to have consumed an adequate amount. So, why bother testing? And, since many vitamins are
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   stored in the liver and other tissues, even if blood levels are adequate, overall body
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   stores may be low. As far as I can tell, the best way to assure nutrient adequacy is not
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   with testing, but with adequate nutrient consumption. Goes on and talks about some of the ways that
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   you can achieve that. Now, let's go specifically to her chapter on specifically what we can
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   do to prepare for children, because here we have a significant set of useful information.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   This is from chapter five, called The Sibling Strategy. Letting your body create a perfect
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   baby. And here is, here are the introductory kind of bullet points. Number one, mom's nutritional
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   status before and during pregnancy influences how much facial and body symmetry her child
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   develops. Remember that facial and body symmetry is a mark of beauty, but more importantly,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   that beauty is a mark of health. And children who have poor body symmetry suffer from all
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   kinds of health problems caused directly by the inadequate body symmetry. In the context
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   of modern diet, birth order correlates with two distinct symmetry shifts away from ideal.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Studies show that most women are nutritionally deficient during childbearing years. Eating
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   sweets and fried foods during pregnancy is likely to be as detrimental as smoking and
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   drinking, if not more so. All evidence suggests that optimizing nutrition represents a powerful
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   strategy for creating healthy, beautiful babies. Almost nothing gives a woman more pride and
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   confidence than the birth of her first child. After one successful pregnancy, there is an
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   understandable expectation that a second pregnancy will go even more smoothly. And perhaps it
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   will, at least for mom. More distensible pelvic issues do facilitate an easier second labor.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   But unless the mother gives herself ample time, generally at least three years, and
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   enough experience for her body to fully replenish itself, child number two may not be as healthy
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   as his older sibling. And so, while big brother goes off to football practice or big sister
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   gets a modeling job, the second sibling will be spending time in the offices of the local
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   optometrists and orthodontists. It's not that they got the "unlucky genes." The
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   problem is that compared to their older sibling, they grew in a relatively undernourished environment
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   in utero. Timing is everything. Why does being born second sometimes mean a child's body
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   is second rate? For one thing, most American women have no idea how badly they're eating.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   One study shows that overall, 74% of women are falling short on nutrients from their
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   diet. And I think even that number is optimistic. If most mothers-to-be aren't even taking
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   in enough nutrients for themselves, how can we expect them to properly provide for a growing
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   baby, not to mention one right after the other? But the biggest reason there's often such
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   a difference between number one and number two in cases of rapid-fire conception has
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   to do with how the placenta works. Even minor nutritional deficiencies can hamper baby's
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   growth. So, to better protect baby, nature has provided a built-in safety mechanism,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   allocating as many resources to the placenta as it can get away with, even if it means
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   putting mom's health at some risk. The baby protection mechanism is so powerful that even
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   on an all-McDonald's diet, a woman can expect to produce a baby with ten fingers and ten
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   toes. Dr. John Dernon of Glasgow University describes the mechanism vividly. "The fetus
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   is well-protected against maternal malnutrition, that indeed it behaves like a parasite, oblivious
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   to the health of its host. If a mom's diet is deficient in calcium, it will be robbed
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   from her bones. If deficient in brain-building fats, as horrible as this sounds, the fats
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   that make up the mother's own brain will be sought out and extracted." Pregnancy drains
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   a woman's body of a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, and other raw materials, and breastfeeding
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   demands more still. As you might expect, the demands of producing a baby draw down maternal
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   stores of a spectrum of nutrients, including iron, folate, calcium, potassium, vitamin
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   D, vitamin A, and carotenoids, magnesium, iodine, omega-3, phosphorus, zinc, DHA, and
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   other essential fatty acids, B12, and selenium. To the placenta, mom's central nervous system,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   for instance, is simply a warehouse full of the kinds of fat needed to build baby's central
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   nervous system. Studies show that maternal brains can actually shrink, primarily in the
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   hippocampal and temporal lobe areas, which control short-term memory and emotion. These
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   brain regions are not responsible for basic functioning, like breathing or blood pressure
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   regulation, and so are relatively expendable. This marvelous nutrient-scavenging ability
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   of a human placenta means that even in conditions of insufficient maternal nutrition, the first
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   child may come out relatively intact. Meanwhile, mom's body may be depleted to the point that
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   before and after pictures reveal her spine to have curved, her lips thinned, and she
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   may have trouble remembering and learning new things, or feel anxious and depressed,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   as in postpartum depression. It may sound harsh, but it's just the selfish gene at work.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Successful genes behave like greedy pirates, commandeering maternal nutrient stores for
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   the benefit of their own optimal replication. However, any child conceived in too short
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   a time for those storehouses to be refilled will be at a significant disadvantage. In
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   such depleted conditions, where baby to extract from mother all the nutrients its genes would
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   like it to have, this would put mom's life at significant risk. Following the utilitarian
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   calculus of genetic survival, biology pragmatically chooses not to kill the mother while a baby
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   is gestating, and opts instead for a compromise. This second baby will be constructed as well
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   as possible in the depleted conditions in order that mom may pull through. Tragically,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   this exposes the child to a variety of health problems, which can become increasingly noticeable
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and even debilitating as they grow older. Here's something else to consider. Sugar
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and vegetable oils act like chemical static that blocks the signals our bodies need to
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   run our metabolism smoothly. Most women's diets today are high in sugar and vegetable
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   oils, adding to the growth disturbances already caused by missing nutrients. Not only does
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   sugar and vegetable oil consumption disrupt maternal metabolism and lead to gestational
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   diabetes, preeclampsia, and other complications of pregnancy, the sugar and vegetable oils
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   streaming through a developing baby's blood block signals in the womb, disrupting the
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   sequence of highly sensitive interdependent developmental events that contribute to the
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   miracle of a healthy birth. The consequences of not getting enough nutrients and the introduction
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   of toxins are primarily brought to bear through changes in the infant's epigenome.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   It goes on and talks about some of the previous things. So the first thing is birth order,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and the author has made a significant study discussing birth order. It's one of the reasons
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   why most of the best-looking people, the most famous models, the most famous movie stars
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   are often the firstborn because they got the full genetic potential of their mother's body.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Whereas follow-on children, if there's not adequate time and adequate nutrition for a
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   mother's body to recover, often suffer from being less attractive. And it's interesting,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   she spent several chapters on it. Now let's pivot and talk about some solutions.

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   The Omega Generation. When I was living and working in Hawaii, four generations sometimes
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   came into my clinic for an office visit all at once, giving me a front row view of the
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   impact of modern food. Quite often this is what I saw. Great Grandma, born on her family's
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   farm and well into her 80s, still had clear vision and her own set of teeth. Her weathered
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   skin sat atop features that looked as though they were chiseled from granite. More often
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   than not, she was the healthiest of the bunch and had a thin medical chart to prove it.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   The youngest child, on the other hand, often presented symptoms of the whole set of modern
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   diseases. Attention deficit, asthma, skin disorders, and recurrent ear infections. Like
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   many of today's generation, one or more of his organs wasn't put together quite right.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Maybe there was a hole in his heart, or maybe he needed surgery to reposition the muscles
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   around an eye. While the exact effects may be hard to predict, what is predictable, given
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   the dwindling dietary nutrients and proliferation of toxic materials, is some kind of physiologic
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   decline. Within a given family, the earlier the abandonment of traditional foods for a
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   diet of convenience, the more easily perceptible the decline. I am thinking of one little boy
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   in particular, the great-grandchild of one of Hawaii's many wealthy missionary families
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   who developed an ear infection during his visit to Kauai from another island. This little
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   boy bore none of his great-grandmother's striking facial geometry. His jaw was narrow,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   his nose blunted and thin, his eyes set too close, and his cheekbones were withdrawn behind
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   plateaus of body fat. The lack of supporting bone under his eyes made his skin sag into
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   bags, giving him a weary look. His ears were twisted, tilted, and protruded, and his ear
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   and mouth were abnormally curved, predisposing him to recurring external ear infections.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Narrow face, thin bones, flattened features, sound familiar? This is a dynamic symmetry
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   shift. The nature and degree was something I'd expect to see if he were child number
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   3 or 4 of siblings born in quick succession. But the young man sitting on my exam table
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   was only the couple's second child, and though mom had given herself a full four years between
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   now and now, it hadn't protected his health. He was the fourth generation product of a
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   century of nutritional neglect and the consequential epigenetic damage. The last century has derailed
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   our entire culture from the traditions that sustained us, so he is far from alone in enduring
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   visible epigenetic damage. And the consequences impact more than a child's skeletal system;
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   their entire genome is at risk. I believe this is why, according to a landmark 2003
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Center for Disease Control report, this child, like all others born in 2000, had a 1 in 3
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   chance of developing diabetes, a condition that reduces life expectancy by between 10
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   and 20 years. What is going unreported is the fact that it isn't just diabetes on the
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   path. Every year, growing battalions of familiar diseases are cutting a wider and wider swath
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   of destruction through the normal experiences of childhood.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Whereas in previous centuries part of a parent's responsibility was to work hard to prevent
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   their children from getting sick, today so many of us are sick ourselves that we've
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   grown to accept disease as one of life's inevitables, even for our children. Today's
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   kids aren't healthy. But rather than make such a sweeping and terrifying declaration,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   we avert our eyes from the growing mound of evidence, fill the next set of prescriptions,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   and expand our definition of normal childhood health to encompass all manner of medical
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   intervention. This latest generation of children has accumulated the epigenetic damage of at
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   least the three previous generations due to lack of adequate nutrition, along with the
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   overconsumption of sugar and new artificial fats found in vegetable oils. The family genome
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   has been getting battered relentlessly for almost a century, even during key delicate
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   periods of replication. The physiologic result of these accumulated genetic insults distorted
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   cartilage, bone, brain, and other organ growth. Many physicians have noted an apparent increase
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   in young couples complaining of problems with fertility, which given the implications of
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   epigenetic science should come as no surprise. Children born today, I'm afraid, may be so
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   genomically compromised that for many reproduction will not be possible even with the benefit
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   of high-tech medical prodding. This is why I call these children the Omega Generation,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   referring to the last letter in the Greek alphabet. Born by caesarean section, often
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   necessitated by maternal pelvic bone abnormalities, briefly breastfed, if at all, weaned on foods
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   with extended shelf lives, the human equivalent of pet foods, these Omega Generation children
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   see the doctor often and, whether firstborn or not, will likely suffer from both biradial
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and dynamic symmetry shifts. In the same way we talk about bracing for the aging baby boomers'
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   medical needs, we had better reinforce the levies of our medical system for the next
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   rising tide, medicine-dependent youth. These children will age faster, suffer emotional
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   problems, and develop never-before-seen diseases. In my experience as a doctor, parents have
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   an intuitive sense that their children are already dealing with more health problems
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   than they ever did, and they worry about their future for good reason. But no parent is helpless
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   if you have children or are planning to. I can think of at least one child who could
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   do something to avoid all this illness and start getting healthy. Yours.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I hope that this narrative is helpful to you and persuasive because I think we can all
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   see it around us with our eyes. If you step back and just look at the – again, I'm
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   from the US-American culture and kind of the Western tradition, but it's so blindingly
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   obvious. The internet made a big brouhaha a couple months ago when people are coming
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   out – I can't remember if it was the FDA or something – but basically coming out
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and prescribing drugs to fat kids to try to help – drugs and surgery to fat kids to
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   try to help them lower their body weight. It's insane. And what has happened as a
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   culture, we have been desensitized to believe our eyes. We've swallowed as a culture the
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   mirage of expertise, thinking that, well, the smart people must have done great science
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and therefore we should listen to the science. And as such, we've stopped believing our
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   own eyes. But all that should be necessary is to walk out in the street or go into the
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   mall and look around you and see the complete and total failure of our health care system
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   in most of our countries. People are ugly. They're fat. They look weird. They can't
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   walk. They're in wheelchairs. The kids are ugly. They look unattractive. And it's not
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   just kind of the normal unattractiveness of awkward growth spurts and everything. You've
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   got sunken in chins and weird deformations, etc. And we don't look like a healthy and
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   attractive culture. And we have to change that. And it has to start with nutrition.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And so if you're going to help your children to flourish and succeed, you have to invest
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   into their nutrition from the earliest of age. And that means investing into mom and
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   dad's nutrition. And you need to do that, if at all possible, prior to conception.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Regardless of where you are in your family growth journey, we should be investing heavily
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   into our nutrition. And this is a very good and very important way for us to be spending
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   money. Money should be spent on acquiring the highest quality nutritional, the highest
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   quality nutrition choices that we can have. Because we owe it to ourselves for our longevity
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and for our enjoyment of good health. We owe it to our children, to our grandchildren,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   our great-grandchildren. We should be systematically building cultures where we're looking forward
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   five or six generations and asking ourselves, "What do my great-great-great-great-grandchildren
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   need to flourish and succeed in the world?" Part of what they need is good genetics. There
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   are other things as well, right? Maybe a trust, a dynasty trust set aside with 360 years worth
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   of buildup that can support future generations. Fine, that's a good part. But at the end of
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   the day, if you can build genetic material that is going to have your children be strong
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   and healthy and long-lived, that's going to pay off massively. Now, I'm guilty of underappreciating
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   this in years past. As I'm getting older, I think more about longevity. And one of the
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   things that's been so remarkable to me is talking to people who don't expect to live
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   long lives. Because I never grew up with that myself. I never grew up with that expectation.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I always grew up expecting that I was going to live a long life. Most of my ancestors
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   on both sides of my family have lived well into their 90s, in some cases, several past
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   100. And then even on my wife's side, amazingly, many of her ancestors are long-lived as well.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   She had one grandfather who died of lung cancer when he was in his 70s as a lifelong smoker.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   But all of the rest of her family members, she had one grandmother that died in early
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   90s, another in... I had to ask her. I think it was close to 90, late 80s. And then a grandfather
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   lived 104 or 105. I can't remember. And so, this is interesting. And it's something that
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I myself never appreciated. But that's a legacy, a legacy of longevity and good health that
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   was passed down to her through her side of the family and to me through our side of the
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   family that we did nothing for. We did nothing to deserve. But what we do have is a responsibility
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   of stewardship. We have a responsibility to steward that legacy for ourselves and to steward
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   that legacy for our own coming generations. And as you'll hear me talk about when I talk
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   about education and academic development, one of the ways that I'm seeking to do this
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   is with educating my own children. So, I have my entire family listening to the audio book
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   of this deep nutrition book because I want my children from the very earliest of ages
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   to be thinking about their genetic wealth that is built up. And what's so fascinating
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   to me as a financial planner is you can turn all of the numbers of finance on their head
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   when you can insert more time. One of the things that I, in my career in income planning
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   course, when I created that course, one of the things I spent a lot of time on is talking
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   about how fundamentally you can transform your entire financial empire if you can rejigger
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   all of the expectations of your expectations around your career and your retirement. And
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   one of the great tragedies of modern, of many modern perspectives, many people's modern
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   goals, is their goal in many cases is to work for the shortest possible period of time so
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   that they can retire for the maximum period of time. And in many cases, people have not
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   received a strong genetic heritage of longevity. And in many cases, people are expecting to
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   die in their 60s, 70s, etc. And when you do that, it compresses all of the financial opportunity
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   that your family has. The numbers that I run are to say, what if you worked until you were
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   earning income? What if you worked earning income from the time that you're 20 to the
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   time that you're 90? And what if you diligently save and invest during that time? And what
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   if you have children when you're 20 or 25? And what if you have even, let's just use
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   normal numbers, okay? Imagine that you have five children, one at say 22, one at 25, one
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   at 28, one at 31, what am I up to, four, right? The one at 35, etc. Imagine that you just
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   have five children. But then what if you build a family culture where each of your children
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   has five children? All of a sudden, the single generation, the family tree can blossom massively.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And what if you build a culture in which there is a tradition and a culture of good health,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   good nutrition? And so most of you, you and your spouse and most of your children, you
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   start to build this culture where you're generally around until you're 90, 100, 120 years old,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   depending on what happens with longevity science and anti-aging stuff, which is a really interesting
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   area of research right now. Well, now you can see and enjoy three and four generations
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   of family culture. And what if you build a financial system where you systematically
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   support your younger generations? And what if you grow that over time? And instead of
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   older generations consuming all the wealth, it just keeps piling up and growing and growing.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   They'll be passing laws against your grandchildren like they do against the Rothschilds or
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   someone. It's just an incredible vision when you flip everything on its head. And to me,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   it's very, very inspiring and encouraging. What if you build a family philosophy that
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   is so robust and so strong? What if you live a faith that is so real and so powerful that
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   all of your great-grandchildren want to be just like you? What if you write a book that
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   encapsulates your wisdom, the things that you have learned, and your great-grandchildren
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   study that book as part of their education? And what if you build that over time and you
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   build a family culture? It's possible. People have done it throughout history. People with
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   vision and a long-time perspective have done it. But we, in our modern age, have often
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   abandoned this on every level. We've abandoned it from a health perspective, and we've
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   expected a pill to solve anything. And we've swallowed the idea that we go, "Well, I
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   just can't do anything about it." We've abandoned the concept of working for future
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   generations in favor of saying, "Well, they've got to figure it out themselves. They've
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   got to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps and, you know, we'll just do that." And
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   these things are not healthy, right? We need to do better. And then back to kind of the
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   working lifetime, we've abandoned largely the idea that our work is a fundamental, core,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   important part of what it means to be a human being, doing important contributions to the
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   world. And we've assumed that the only reason to work is to earn money so that we can quit
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and retire. One of my favorite heroes is Dr. Denmark, who was, I think, the first female
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   doctor to pass through, was the American Medical Association, something like that. She was
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   a pediatrician in the state of Georgia, and she worked in active practice as a pediatrician
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   until the age of 104, and then she retired for 10 years and died at 114. Well, if you
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   could have the health and the kind of job that allows you to do that, just imagine what
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   it can do to your finances. It's an incredible idea. So, this concept of investing into genetic
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   wealth is really, really important. And one of the areas that we should be improving our,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   increasing our expenditures in our budgets is on food. We shouldn't have a goal of saying,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   "Well, what can I get on coupons that's cheap?" You know, I like couponing. I think it's cool.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I really love Amy Decision's, you know, the Tightwad Gazette. But one of my great frustrations
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   is a lot of the cheap food that you can get great coupons on is not good food. And so,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   food is something that we should be intentional about increasing our budget, and we should
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   be finding and sourcing the highest quality foods and preparing them in the very best
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   ways, and making sure that we ourselves and our children receive the highest possible
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   nutrition, because these are the building blocks, and we need to invest into these things
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   over the course of years, years and years. This is important for men and women, both,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   because for men, your nutrition affects your ability to procreate, whether you have viable
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   sperm or not, and then the health of your sperm make a huge difference in the long-term
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   health of the baby. One of the comments that, let me double-check her name, again, I think
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   it's Shanahan, one of the comments that she made, yeah, Catherine Shanahan, one of the
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   comments that she made in the book is about infertility. I have been shocked as, due to
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   the significantly high levels of infertility that I see presented by my age group and my
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   peer group, and some of these things are explainable and some of them are not, but it is shocking
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   how many of my peers who over the last 10 years should be and should have been in their
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   prime reproduction age, and I'm thinking healthy-looking people, right, people who seem like young,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   vigorous, healthy adults who have tremendous problems conceiving children and then bringing
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   children to term, to healthy childbirth, and so it's a big and important thing. One more,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   I want to read one sidebar to you from this book, and I want to urge you that if this
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   is something that you want to think more about, pick up Deep Nutrition or pick up any other
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   book that you think will help you make a study of this and add anything to your own studies
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   in this area, but I want to read this sidebar to you, and I want to point out to you how
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   these things can make a difference in terms of investing in children. Six ways nutrition
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   can optimize your child's growth. Number one, height. Pour more milk. A meta-analysis
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   concluded that for each additional 100 milliliters of milk, roughly 3.3 ounces consumed daily,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   children grew an extra 0.2 centimeters, roughly 1/8 inch per year. Children in the study were
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   aged 2 to 20, and the study duration ranged from a few months to two years. The study's
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   authors noted that the growth effect was especially powerful in teens. It is not known if higher
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and sustained milk supplementation would have additive effects, but if avid milk drinker
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   and NBA player Jeremy Lin is any example, at 6'3" with 5'6" parents, then perhaps
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   it may. Height is something that is strongly correlated, especially in men. Height is something
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   that is strongly correlated to lifetime success. I myself am 6 1/2 feet tall. I haven't measured
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   it. I probably, I don't know if I'm stronger than that, but somewhere between 6'5" and
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   6'6". When I was younger, it was 6'5" and 3/4" when I stretched up, so let's just call
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   it 6'5". During my entire lifetime, being tall has given me immeasurable advantages.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It automatically commands more respect because you have a more imposing presence. People
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   look up to you in the figurative sense, meaning they just automatically assume you to be more
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   capable. Big tall men. I have a good friend of mine who is very short, a couple of them.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   We were talking about it recently, and what's amazing is that he's several years my senior,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   has all kinds of qualifications, but because of his short physical stature, people underestimate
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   him constantly and continually. You look at income stats, etc. Tall men have earned higher
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   incomes. Tall men have a much easier time attracting beautiful spouses. It just makes
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   a big difference. If there's something that you can do to help your children to grow in
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   height, then it's dramatic. Ms. Shanahan includes information in here in the book, an interesting
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   analysis where you can see as nutrition in a population increases and gains and becomes
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   better, then the height of a population increases. So height is important. Vision. Look for lots
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   of variety. In a study of children between ages 7 and 10, children who developed nearsightedness
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   compared to children who did not consumed significant less of a wide variety of nutrients.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Protein, fat, cholesterol, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin C, phosphorus, and iron. Of note,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   although the myopic children ate roughly 300 fewer calories, there was no difference between
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   the two groups in several anatomic metrics, height, weight, or head circumference. This
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   suggests that while normal height, weight, and head circumference are indications of
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   sufficient nutritional intake, they are not definitive indicators of optimal nutrition.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   It also suggests that children with normal vision may have been more physically active.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I've always been nearsighted and I had LASIK vision correction surgery a couple years ago
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   and it was a transformative event in my life. To finally experience what people with excellent
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   vision experience, a life free of corrective lenses, has improved my quality of life immeasurably.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   It's one of the best things that has happened to me over the last decade. And if we can
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   give good nutrition as well as good eyesight exercises, and et cetera, we may have a good
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   eyesight exercise, good sunlight, good exercise, et cetera, just overall producing healthier
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   children, we may help those children to have a higher chance of maintaining appropriately
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   normal vision. Cognitive development, skip starchy snacks, nutrients shown to correlate
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   most strongly with high IQ include vitamin E, omega-3, and iodine. Studies have shown
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   that the higher a child's vitamin E, the better their language and social skills. Similarly,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   the higher a newborn's omega-3, as measured in maternal umbilical cord blood, the higher
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   that child's IQ later in childhood. Additionally, cognition has been shown to be impaired by
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   a snacky pattern of eating high carb foods, characterized by foods that require minimum
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   preparation such as potatoes and other starchy roots, salty snacks, sugar preserves, and
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   confectionery. Presumably this effect is mediated through reduced nutrition to calorie ratio.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Again, IQ and cognitive ability is a major driver in long-term success of your children.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And so from utero, you want to do everything possible to support the development of the
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   smartest and most functional brain that your children are capable of, and then you want
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   to support that, including supporting it with good nutrition. Lifespan, beget big babies,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   larger children born to non-diabetic moms have greater muscle mass, higher resistance
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   to diabetes and obesity, and longer telomeres, the part of the DNA that determines how many
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   more divisions a cell can undergo, thus influencing cellular lifespan, all known to be associated
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   with longer life expectancy. How to grow a big baby without developing gestational diabetes?
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Aside from being tall and well-fed during your own childhood, we don't know much about
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   specific interventions to produce bigger babies, but we do know something about how to avoid
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   having a too small baby. Don't smoke, don't conceive while you're undernourished or
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   underweight, and don't restrict protein, i.e. if you're vegan, you may need to supplement.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Immune system, maximize microbes and micronutrients. Researchers at UC Davis found that individuals
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   with subtle deficiencies of various micronutrients are more prone to develop a variety of common
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   day-to-day infections, and are more likely to have more severe infections with prolonged
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   convalescence. Allergies, asthma, and autoimmune illnesses are more prevalent in children with
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   reduced microbial gut flora diversity. Experts recommend breastfeeding to optimize early
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   gut flora development, and are considering recommending soil-based probiotics, including
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   fermented foods in a child's diet, and encouraging outdoor play would be my preferred
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   methods of introducing immune-boosting probiotics. Back to the immune system. Anything we can
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   do to cultivate large and strong immune systems will have a strong knock-on effect to our
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   children's lifetime success. A child who is sickly and misses, say, 10% of his school
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   days will have a much harder time achieving academic success than the child who is healthy
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   and is always present in school. These small percentages expanded out over time make a
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   huge difference in long-term success. I mentioned on the previous episode that when I'm sick,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   I'm just filled with empathy for people who don't enjoy robust health, and I realize how
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   much of my own success in life has simply come from the simple fact that I did nothing
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   to deserve of being healthy. Because when you're healthy and you feel good, you're
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   filled with energy, you can work hard, you can work consistently, and that work pays
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   off in terms of financial productivity, career productivity, etc. Somebody who has a weakened
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   immune system, and even just excluding chronic conditions, just experiences, gets more colds,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   more flus, common ordinary sicknesses, and those sicknesses, instead of being beat in
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   six hours or a day, they linger on for two or three days, that person's, at the end of
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   the year and at the end of the decade, that person's personal productivity will be dramatically
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   reduced due to something as simple as having a weak immune system.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Puberty. Avoid insulin resistance. Junk food consumption and being overweight are both
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance impacts boys and girls in different
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   ways. For girls, it causes precocious puberty, so common today that we find breast development,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   typical of 11-year-olds a generation ago, often occurring in 7-year-olds, and rarely
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   in 3-year-olds. Aside from its detrimental psychological effects, precocious puberty
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   typically reduces the child's adult height. In boys, insulin resistance reduces testosterone
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   levels. Low testosterone during puberty is associated with decreased development of muscle
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   mass, impaired growth of the penis and testicles, reduced deepening of the voice, development
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   of breast tissue, and lack of normal male hair growth.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   In conclusion for this particular commentary, do everything you possibly can to emphasize
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   the health of a mother and a father and build strongly the health of the mother and father
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   prior to conception so that at the moment of conception, you have the very healthiest,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   most vibrant sperm that could possibly exist, and you have the very healthiest, most beautiful
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   egg that could possibly exist. And when those come together and in that magical moment form
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   your new baby, you want all of the genetic material that is present to be completely
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   functional and give you the highest probability of having a beautiful, healthy child. Then
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   throughout pregnancy, support the mother's physical health as strongly as your budget
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   can possibly make possible. Buy the very highest quality foods in abundance. Support her with
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   the greatest diversity of nutrients, making sure that her diet is of the best quality
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   that exists. Don't cheap out on good food just to save a buck. Think of your family's
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   genetic heritage 50, 100, 200 years from now and invest into it today the way that you
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   wish your forebears had invested into it for you. You may not come from a family of strong
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   genetic wealth. Your parents may have all, or your grandparents may have all expired
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   at the age of 60. That stinks. But you can start today to give the kind of gift to your
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   great-grandchildren that you wish they could have. So in conclusion to this long section,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   nutrition makes a huge impact on long-term growth potential of your child.

[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Now, in addition to nutrition, you want to do everything you can to support a mother's
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   health during the gestation of your baby. That includes exercise and psychology. One
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   of the most important things for a mother to do during gestation while the baby is in
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   her womb is to exercise consistently but not over much. Meaning a strong mother will have
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   a better pregnancy, will be healthier, contribute to the health of the baby, and will have a
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   better childbirth and a better recovery after childbirth. And so you want a mother to be
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   exercising consistently and to be strong. And then psychologically, one of the best
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   investments you can make is helping an expectant mother to be in the healthiest possible state.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   As a man, once you've made your contribution to the family genetic pool, it's done. Your
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   physical health is not, your physical actions are not going to impact the baby at that point
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   on genetically, whereas a mother's body will. But what you can do is you can care for the
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   mother in a strong way and make sure that all of her emotional state is as positive
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   as it possibly can be with the goal of having a healthy and natural childbirth. It's hard
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   to know, just like with genetic factors regarding health, it's always hard to know how much
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   credit a person can take for the relative good health that you may enjoy. You ask yourself,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   "Well, am I enjoying good health because of all my hard work and my good diet and my
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   good exercise, etc., or am I enjoying good health because I won the genetic lottery?"
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   On the other hand, "Am I sick because of my own choices or am I sick because of the choices
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   of my forebears?" How do you know? Same thing with natural childbirth. If you're trying
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   to help a mother prepare for natural, for effective and healthy and smooth and easy
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   and pain-free childbirth, and she experiences that, it's hard to know how much credit to
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   take. I know plenty of people who worked hard to prepare for childbirth and weren't able
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   to do it. So I'm giving a disclaimer here that I'm going to tell you some of the things
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   that I have done and that my wife and I have worked at to try to have healthy, easy
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   childbirths, and thank God we've experienced those. But I also acknowledge the fact that
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I don't know how much of that is due to any particular single factor that we have done.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   But I'll tell you what we do. First, I think that you should have a goal of having
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   the very best childbirth that you want, that you can have. And if you're looking for the
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   well-being of the child, I think the best outcome for the child is to have a natural
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   vaginal childbirth, if at all possible. It's the best for the mother and it's the best
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   for the child. Now, in the United States, at least among my peers who are culturally
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   similar, there is a strong... This is kind of acknowledged, like of course that's what
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   the desire would be. Globally though, you'll find regions of the world in which this is
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   not even discussed. There are some regions of the world in which their rate of natural
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   childbirth is incredibly low. All of us should be extremely grateful for the technology
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   of cesarean childbirth. It's an incredible technology that has saved so many mothers
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   and babies' lives and we should be grateful for it. It is inferior... Cesarean birth is
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   superior to the death of a mother or the death of a baby, but it is inferior to natural
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   childbirth if the goal is the best start for the baby. Without going past my area of
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   expertise, there are all kinds of functions of the actual birth process for a baby that
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   if a baby will experience natural, non-drug-affected vaginal childbirth, he will be set up for
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   his best possible chance at life. The action of the womb during labor, the chemicals and
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   the... I wish I knew all the proper terms. I've read cursory about it enough to know
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   that it's there, but without going deeply into it. But all of the chemicals and the
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   bacteria and the things that the baby is exposed to as he passes along the vaginal birth path,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   all of these things are really good. And when a baby is born at full term through natural
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   childbirth, the baby is strong and ready to go. And his first days can be incredibly healthy
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   and he can very quickly go about his entrance into the world. I've seen this happen five
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   times and I've always been just so blessed to see a healthy, happy baby come into the
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   world. And I myself have received all five of my children. It's something that happened
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   unintentionally the first time and since then I loved it so much. It was just a wonderful
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   aspect. And I always tell fathers, like one of the coolest things you can do is you be
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   the one to receive your own babies. It's an amazing thing. And so when you hold a newborn
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   in your hands that is literally one second old and you can interact with and you see
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   him happy and healthy and alert and ready to go, and then you start that process, a
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   bonding process with a mother and she's not drugged up, the baby's not drugged up, she's
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   alert, she's rested, she's healthy, et cetera. It starts everything going well. And so if
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   at all possible, work for and plan for natural childbirth. The things that we try to do is
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   really good nutrition, really good exercise, chiropractic care to me makes a big difference.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Chiropractic care, regular chiropractic care of a mother in preparation for childbirth
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   to ensure that her pelvis and her skeletal system is in the best alignment possible.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   And then dealing with the psychological challenges that can sometimes impair childbirth,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   making sure that a mother feels strong and confident about her ability to deliver a child,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   making sure that she's completely free of fear related to childbirth, that she's filled
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   with positive expectation around childbirth, and then using good techniques to minimize
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   pain and discomfort during childbirth. All of these are good and productive things to
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   work at. And I'm not going to go deep because I think those are well attended to in most
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   of the cultures that I'm exposed to. Now, in the very afterbirth, however the birth
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   goes, the most important thing that you can do to invest into your child is to invest
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   into the relationship of your baby and the mother. In general, this means having lots
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   and lots of time together. If you want your child to succeed, the best investment you
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   can make into your baby is making sure that he and his mother have a strong relationship.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   And this begins from the very beginning. Physically, his most important nutrition is going to
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   come from breastfeeding. The data on breastfeeding is unequivocal. And again, just like the comment
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   on C-sections, we should be grateful for the many babies' lives who have been saved with
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   high quality nutritious formula. We should also acknowledge, and we should acknowledge
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   that formula is better than death. But formula is nowhere near as good for a baby as his
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   mother's breast milk. The problem is breastfeeding is hard. It is hard and it is incredibly
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   demanding on a mother. It's hard and demanding in a way that I think, at least in my experience,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   is probably more than birth. When my wife and I had our first baby, we worked so hard
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   to be prepared for the childbirth and we were so blindsided by how difficult breastfeeding
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   was that it was just, it was way more difficult than childbirth. Breastfeeding is difficult
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   physically for the mother. It hurts. It hurts in different ways at different stages. But
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   those first few days are often extremely painful. And it's incredibly demanding because of
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   the scheduling demands that the baby places on the mother. Babies don't sleep very long
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   because they're usually hungry. I forget what the formula is. People say, okay, the baby
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   can sleep for as many hours as he is months old or something like that. But the point
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   is a new baby will often need to eat every two, three, four hours depending on the child
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   and depending on the age. This eating process, especially for a little baby, is often a 30
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   to 60 to 90 minute process depending on the child and depending on what's necessary for
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   the burping and all of the stuff, etc. And so a new mother is going to wind up being
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   awakened on a 24 hour basis every few hours. And that's very, very disruptive for her.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   It's very, very hard. And so if you're going to support that process, the most important
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   thing you can do is eliminate all of her stress, eliminate all of her difficulty, and eliminate
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   all of her outside obligations. So what I try to do is make sure that the only job she
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   has is to take care of baby. And obviously I'm going to do my best to help take care
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   of baby, especially in those early days. For the uninitiated fathers, one of the things
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   that's very important to understand is that childbirth, even the most medically textbook
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   perfect childbirth, quote unquote, is a traumatic physical event. When the placenta of the baby
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   detaches from the uterine wall, it leaves a significant scar, a significant wound that
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   needs time to heal. And so a new mother needs time in bed, she needs time just to recover,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   she needs time just to rest and heal. And that process, she shouldn't carry the baby
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   in the first few days, she shouldn't be doing anything difficult, she should just be resting
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   and recovering from childbirth. And breastfeeding itself is such a demand on a mother's body
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   that she needs lots of time to rest. So you can't really spend money on this process.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   What you can do is you can spend time, and you can try to eliminate her stress. And so
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   at least the way that we've tried to do it is right now my wife does nothing. I do everything
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   that can possibly be done, which is why I'm talking about this with you. And I haven't
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   done many podcasts because I'm making all the food, I'm taking care of all the children,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   I'm doing all the homeschooling, and she's in bed with the baby. That's her job. And
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   I do what I can to help with the baby, but obviously it's just, it's a mother's job in
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   the first few months. Now, if you want to invest in the long-term outcome for your new
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   baby, then you'll do everything you can to extend the duration of that relationship and
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   contact between the mother. A baby who experiences the continual comforting presence of his mother
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   will have most likely a strong psychological standpoint in life. If you go and look at
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   some of the studies that have been done for babies in orphanages, and you look at everything
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   from touch, right, how much a baby is touched, spoken to, etc., then what you see is that
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   the most important thing for a baby is relationship. Lots and lots of cuddling, right? There's
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   studies on skin-on-skin contact, making sure the baby has lots of contact with a mother
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   or father's body, skin-on-skin. Making sure that there's lots of conversation, lots of
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   reassurance. You can build a strong psychology into your baby, or let me rephrase. Hold on,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   that was probably too strong of a statement. You can put in place the best possibility
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   of a strong psychology, emotional regulation in your baby at an early age if the baby will
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   know nothing but continual love and continual connection. So the physical aspect is provided
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   by the nutrition from his mother. So we support the mother's body with the best nutrition
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   that we can. The mother's body creates the highest quality breast milk for the baby.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   That breast milk, with ideally copious amounts and for extended periods of time, is going
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   to provide for the best possible growth potential of the baby. But that's demanding on the mother.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   So the way that we invest into that is by freeing the mother from obligations. Imagine
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   yourself, this is why I hate it when women feel like they have to go back to work three
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   months after the baby is born. Imagine yourself as a breastfeeding mother, sitting at work
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   with a thing on your breasts, you know, and trying to find a quiet corner where you can
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   put a thing on your breasts so you can pump milk for your baby, so that some, you know,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   hired worker can give that milk to your baby. There are so many dedicated mothers who do
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   this, and it sucks for them. And so as a husband, as a father, one of your, I say mandatory,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   but you do it, is to never put your wife in that situation. If she has a job or a career
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   that she wants to pursue, and your children are older, and they're not breastfeeding,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   and you've got a great school for them, and they're older, etc., fine. But don't ever
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   put that kind of demand on your wife that somehow she's going to go to work with a pump
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   attached to her breasts and try to figure out how to make money while she's doing that.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   If that's something that she does, you guys work out fine, but don't ever make it because
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   of money. Invest in such a way so that she can be there with the baby, and so that she
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   can be there constantly with the baby, and so that she can get plenty of sleep, and so
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   that she can get all of the things that she needs. One of the reasons I've set up my life
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   the way that I have is to be able to support my wife. My wife is not sleep deprived. Her
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   sleep schedule is messed up because she's being awakened during the night, of course,
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   but she's not sleep deprived. I make sure she gets plenty of sleep because I've arranged
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   my life in such a way that I can support her in that so that she's not sleep deprived.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   And these, to me, are really useful points of wealth. It's a good way to spend money,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   and it pays off in terms of the long-term benefit for your children. So if you want
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   to invest in your babies, what do they need? They need love. They need physical touch.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   They need conversation. They need nutrition. They need sleep. And the best person who's
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   able to provide those things is their mother. The most dedicated professional in the world.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   You go out and you find the best trained nanny for your 22-month-old baby is never going
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   to have the strongest, the kind of care that the baby's mother can have. And so support
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   her in that. Now there are women who are not inclined in the direction of mothering.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   Increasingly, I think many of those women today have chosen not to bear children.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Historically in the past, there were a lot of mothers who bore children, and they just
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   weren't great mothers. And so that was why I made the comments I made about if you want
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   to have healthy children, you're going to need to choose a healthy mother. A mother
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   who's willing and is going to love her children. And do the best with what you've got, whatever
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   it is that you have, as fathers and husbands. But support her in that, and make her job
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   easy. And the more that her psychology is strong, the better she feels, the more loved
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   and cared for she is, the happier the baby is likely to be. And investing into those
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   initial months and years of a baby's life, it all comes down to presence. There's nothing
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   academic that you can do, there's nothing, anything that's going to matter. It comes
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   down to presence and being together.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   I'm going to save some of the positive things that you can do physically and whatnot for
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   young children for the next episode in this series. I'll just on this, just include here,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   the importance of eliminating and removing all trauma and potential trauma from a baby's
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   life. If you look at the development of children who've been raised in difficult circumstances,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   right, you can go and you can find children who, fetal alcohol syndrome, their mother
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   drank a lot, or drugs and whatnot, and you can see the physical problems those children
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   face. You can go and you can look at some of the studies that have been done on children
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   raised in orphanages, and over the years there's just been some horrific, horrifically immoral
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   studies done, you know, about children that didn't experience touch, and children that
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   weren't talked to and whatnot. And they're just, they're wrecked for life. But one of
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   the things that is clear and consistently true is you have to make sure that you eliminate
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   trauma, or potential trauma, in a child's life. And, you know, serious trauma when children
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   are physically abused or sexually abused, it literally stunts their growth and their
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   development on, in some cases, a physical level, but especially on an emotional and
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   cognitive level. There are 50-year-old men out there walking around in, with the brain
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   of a six-year-old because they experienced some significant trauma when they were six
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   years old. And so you have a duty and a responsibility to your children to construct around them
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   a very, very safe cocoon, and to make sure that they are in that safe cocoon until they
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   are ready to leave it. There is a huge difference between telling your, working with your 14-year-old
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   to help your 14-year-old face the challenges of the modern age and of "real life" versus
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   forcing your 14-year-old to go to the church nursery when he's sitting there crying for
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   you. There's a huge difference between dealing with adolescents and older children who are
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   capable of rational thought, etc., and having separation, etc., from their parents versus
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   dealing with young children and separating young children from their parents. And so
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   in many, one of the things I have observed is that in our modern age, many parents seem
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   to take pride in their children's ability to be detached from the parent. I don't think
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   that's necessarily a thing to take pride in, right? A healthy child at an appropriate age
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   should certainly be able to do well not being with a parent. That's fine. But you want your
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   children to know nothing but complete safety during the entire lifetime until they're ready
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   to bear adult responsibilities and recognize that the world is unsafe, but especially in
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   those early years. So you must protect your children from trauma and potential trauma
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   in all of its forms. Be a bear about it if necessary. If there are people in your life
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   who are potential sources of fear, of trauma, etc. And by the way, this can range, we have
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   a tendency I think to go to the most extreme, meaning we have a tendency to go to the most
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   horrific expressions of abuse that we're aware happen in the world. But I think most of us
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   don't face those dangers very much, right? Those dangers are actually quite low in the
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   modern world. But there are a lot of traumas that come in that are much more mild. Scary
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   stories, scary people, scary ideas, etc. These things are not healthy to impose into our
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   children's lives. And so I guess my point is simply be a bear and create a very safe
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   and warm and comfortable home environment that is protected, that is a shelter so that
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   your children don't experience any form of trauma. In the next episode of this series
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   we will pick up with childhood education. We'll talk about the things that you can do
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   to support your children in their development physically, spiritually, mentally, and
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   academically, and how you can do a lot of those things at a very early age. So I don't
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   participate in Teach-A-Baby-To-Read like I once did, but I do think there's a lot you
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   can do at a very early age. And we'll pick up with some of those things that on this
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   foundation can supercharge the results of success in the modern world. And I'll share
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   with you how those things can, again, keep your child on a success path. By way of review
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   I want to emphasize, because sometimes because I've talked so much about so many things
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   you may have lost the thread. By way of review I want to emphasize what we've talked about.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   Number one, the basic genetics of a child's parents are going to drive the child's
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   long-term success. So you want to be very careful about who you are engaging to be the
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   genetic donor of your child. In addition, that person who is supporting the mother is
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   going to have an inordinate influence on the kind of babyhood that that child receives.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   So as a prospective mother, choosing to marry somebody who wants children and wants you
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   to be a mother is going to be very different than choosing to marry somebody who expects
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   you to earn two-thirds of the family income and get back to work really quickly. Choosing
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   to marry somebody who earns enough money to allow you to comfortably be a stay-at-home
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   mother is going to put your life on a very different scale than marrying somebody who
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   doesn't earn enough money to allow you to comfortably be a stay-at-home mother. So you
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   want to be very careful. Choosing to marry somebody who is of high character and is going
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   to treat you well and willing to spend the money on your nutrition, etc., those things
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   matter. So you want to think about it prior to the relationship. Then prior to conception
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   of the baby, you want to do everything possible on a physical basis to support the nutrition
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   of the mother and father so that the baby has the very best genetic material already
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   woven into his body at the moment of conception. Then while the baby is in utero, you want
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   to do everything you can to support his healthy growth and working towards supporting the
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   health and the mental strength of the mother so that she can be looking forward to a healthy
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   and safe natural childbirth. And then after childbirth, you want to support the baby with
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   the best nutrition coming through his mother's breast milk and the best environment for him
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   to grow, which primarily means sleeping and eating, in a completely safe environment.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   And you want to keep mama feeling really strong mentally with lots of rest, lots of support,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   and you want to keep her really strong physically. Then as your baby starts to reach several
