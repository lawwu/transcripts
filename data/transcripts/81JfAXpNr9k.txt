[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   I was teaching a course on Maven about product management, and I was interviewing coaches
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.280]   to help me with the course.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.280]   And I had about 10 coaches.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.960]   I was interviewing them with someone else that was helping me out with the course.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.680]   And one of the coaches started her own sub-stack, subscribed me to it, and then just started
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.480]   writing posts about how she's the perfect fit to coach this course.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.360]   And I was like, "Holy shit, we need to make sure that we talk to her for sure."
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.640]   And we did, and it didn't work out there because she wasn't quite the fit, but I found something
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.520]   else to do with her, and now she's a core part of my newsletter community, helps run
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.020]   a lot of the programs.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.020]   The question is, how do you stand out?
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.020]   How do you stand out?
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.880]   You do something really remarkable that gets someone's attention.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.880]   There's a lot of ways to do it.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.600]   I do a lot of angel investing, and whenever I get a founder that makes a loom, "Hey, Lenny,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.240]   I really wanted to talk to you about the startup I'm building.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.560]   Here's why it's awesome."
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   I watch them.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.280]   Most of the time, I talk to them because they put in the effort and they do something unique.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.200]   So I think it applies to investing too, pick the people you really want on your cap table
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600]   and do some extra.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.760]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.760]   money, and travel.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.240]   Today, we're going to talk about the best strategies and tactics for your work.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.520]   That means finding a job you love, interviewing, negotiating your comp, managing up, making
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.540]   an impact, getting promoted, and a lot more.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.680]   And to do this, I'm joined by Lenny Ruchitsky, who sold his company to Airbnb in 2012 and
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.800]   spent seven years working in product across the company before leaving to start his newsletter
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.240]   and more recently podcast.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.760]   Now, Lenny is well-known as one of the top minds in the world when it comes to building
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.800]   and growing software products, and his podcast, Lenny's Podcast, is the number one product
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.440]   podcast in the world.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.000]   But product building isn't why he's here today.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's because he's written so many amazing newsletters about his professional work that
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.220]   I've found so valuable to my own career.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.240]   So whether you're looking for a job right now, trying to have more impact in your current
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.520]   role, or thinking about what's next, I am sure you'll love this episode.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.960]   Lenny, thanks for being here.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840]   My pleasure, Chris.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.680]   You have written a ton of content about product management and amongst product managers, which
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.420]   I formerly was, you are well-known in that space for being a thought leader.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.060]   However, I found that a lot of your content is very, very applicable outside of product
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.380]   management to anyone who has a job.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.540]   And now we're probably going to dig into a little bit more about the transition to creators.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.180]   I just got to ask, are you aware of the breadth of applicability of your content and do you
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.780]   see a transition in the future to just more than product-related content and just really
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.340]   growing beyond that?
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.700]   I am aware the content is useful to a lot of people other than product managers, because
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700]   I get emails from people and they're like, "Hey, our marketing team's finding this super
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.700]   useful."
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.100]   Or the funniest example is my mother-in-law, who is 75, I think, something like that.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.340]   And she reads every post that I write and finds something in there that is applicable
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.420]   to her life.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.280]   And that just shows me that there's all these little lessons that you can extract from things
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.820]   that are specifically meant for product managers and founders.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.980]   But I will say I try very hard to stay focused on a PM, a founder, someone building product,
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.740]   because I think that's the reason it does well, is it's solving a very clear person's
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.740]   problem.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.020]   And if I were to try to broaden it too wide, I think it would just lose the power and just
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.460]   become nothing amazing for any one person.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.980]   So it is a balance, but it is cool that the second order effect becomes useful to a lot
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.980]   of other people.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.720]   For anyone listening, Lenny has a newsletter, Lenny has a podcast.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.220]   I have been a guest on his podcast that may or may not have come out before or after this
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.520]   comes out and highly recommend it, even if you're not in product, just like your mother-in-law
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   said.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.500]   However, we're not going to talk that much about product today.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.900]   We're going to talk about some of those other things.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.380]   And in fact, I thought as I went through a lot of your posts, that you have a really
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.900]   unique and great perspective on the process of someone going through their career, both
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.440]   getting a job, working at a company, starting on your own.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I've thought a lot about this too.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.860]   So I thought we could just have a conversation to walk through that process.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.040]   And you could share a lot of the lessons you've learned and shared and written about for anyone,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.100]   whether they're trying to advance their career today, or they're looking for something new,
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.040]   or they're looking for something right now, because we're in an unfortunate situation
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.400]   where some people may have lost their jobs, and I would love to give them more tools to
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.960]   be successful in their search.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.720]   So how's that sound?
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.760]   Sounds great with the caveat that I write these posts, and then the content leaves my
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.780]   brain and lives in the post.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.360]   And part of the reason I write them is like, "Hey, go read this thing, because I forgot
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360]   all the answers."
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.260]   So I'll do my best to extract what I can remember.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.520]   And I did a little prep, but I won't have all of the answers in my head on demand necessarily.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.840]   Well, fortunately for you, I try to do a really good job of putting resources in the show
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   notes.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.560]   And if there's one that we feel like your answer is lacking in comparison to what I've
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.880]   seen you write, I will make sure that we link that so people can follow up.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.400]   But let's start with the process of finding the right kind of job.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680]   So there are so many types of companies out there.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.400]   What advice do you have for people looking for something new, both in just how to narrow
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.200]   down the options and actually stand out to candidates to get that first interview?
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.680]   So just thinking that process.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.120]   And for a side note, Lenny also runs a job board and a talent collective for people in
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.800]   the product space.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.760]   So you've seen this both as a person in it and a person creating this thing.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.000]   So just to recap, how do people narrow down what they want to do and find a company and
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.600]   then actually stand out to get in the door?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.080]   Yeah, let me talk about the job board briefly because I think it's cool.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.920]   It's a cool piece of context that shows kind of how much I spend thinking about people's
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.220]   profiles and companies and things like that.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.880]   So it's called Lenny's Jobs.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.680]   It runs on this platform called Palette, which is kind of like the substack for job boards.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.760]   It's kind of this white labeled job platform.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.560]   And the way it works, there's kind of two parts to it.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.520]   There's a regular job board where people just post job openings.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.920]   And then there's a reverse job board where candidates can sign up because they're interested
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   in new opportunities.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.400]   And they can just be like, "Hey, I'm open to a new opportunity.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.600]   I'd love to hear from interesting companies."
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   And it can be anonymous.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.840]   You could hide yourself from companies that you don't want to see that you're looking
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.320]   for a job, and it's doing really well.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.840]   It's become maybe the number one place to find product people.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.440]   I don't know where else you go look for PMs better than this place.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:50.080]   And fun fact, they make more income from just the job board than I made at Airbnb in salary.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.040]   And so it turns into a really interesting business on the side and shows the power of
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.960]   an audience with the newsletter and the audience of that being funneled to the job board, creating
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960]   a marketplace.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.800]   It's really interesting.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.480]   If you look at people that actually end up getting jobs from this, is it more from people
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.080]   finding the job from the employer or have things changed in the environment where the
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.840]   employee putting themselves out there is actually leading to more jobs?
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.800]   So one thing I've learned from this is job boards do not work well.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.400]   They're either, and job board meaning you post an opening on a job board.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.200]   If it works for you, it's like the best ROI in the history of hiring, because it's like
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.600]   50 bucks, 100 bucks, 200 bucks to post a job and you find someone for that and then you're
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   done.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.800]   But it almost never works is what I found.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.400]   What actually worked is the reverse, the other piece where candidates that are awesome apply.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.200]   I approve them and I only approve about 10% of people to keep the quality by really high.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.440]   And that has led to so many companies finding PMs as a product, VPs a product.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.680]   And so I think it's the model.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.160]   I think that model is a lot more effective now before the economy changed.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.040]   And so I'm leaning into that.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.440]   I'm kind of moving away from the job board.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.360]   And this site, you said pallet, does there, you might not know this, but is there a directory
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.200]   of all the different job boards they power for something like this?
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.880]   You know, if someone listening is like, I'm not a PM, but I would love to participate
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.620]   in this reverse job search process to put myself out there in front of companies.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.700]   Are there other job boards or directory of them to go find places to post yourself?
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.420]   Yeah, they actually have a cool feature.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.820]   I think it's called spotlight where you work with them and they give you access to a ton
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.300]   of different job boards for specific profiles.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.500]   And so I get these applications for one company looking for like a designer and they can just
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.940]   only look at my designer candidates.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.020]   So yeah, it's pretty cool what they're building, how, if you're building this profile, right,
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.020]   you're a candidate building a profile, setting aside that it's in product, but what are the
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.580]   things you think you've seen people do to one stand out, but also to identify what they're
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.580]   interested in?
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.860]   Cause I think there's a world of all kinds of companies you could work at.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.220]   The way I think about it, there's, there's a lot of personal things that are important
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.700]   to people like where they work, where they live and are they want to work and things
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.700]   like that.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.900]   But I'd say if you just, if I think of four things that are really important, I think
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.700]   of the people at the company, the stage of the company, the mission of the company, and
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.100]   then just the quality of the business.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.100]   So just to go through them briefly.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.140]   So with people, what I look for and what I think you should look for is where the smartest
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.620]   people, you know, going to go work, trying to go work or already working.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.620]   And there's kind of a few reasons why that's really powerful.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.340]   One is it's more likely that they'll build an awesome product and awesome business that'll
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340]   do really well.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:43.300]   So the smartest people working in a company more likely to succeed to you'll learn a lot
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.420]   more from that group.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.460]   If you're just working with the smartest people, you can find, you're going to learn a lot
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.460]   more.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.400]   And then three, which is a little bit underappreciated.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.900]   I think the alumni network that you build from a company that you work at ends up being
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.180]   a really huge asset.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.940]   If you work at a company that ends up succeeding and doing well and growing.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.100]   And so there's a lot of benefit to working in a place where you can build this really
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.860]   smart, successful, growing alumni network.
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.940]   As an example, a friend and I started the Airbnb alumni investing syndicate called Air
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.940]   Angels.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.060]   We invest in companies as a group, there's about 500 of us in the syndicate.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.460]   And basically we find companies to invest in, we invest using an SPV and look for ways
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.460]   to be helpful.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.100]   And it ends up being a really awesome, fun experience we all learn together.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.060]   That's one, find the place where the smartest people you know are going to.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.980]   I think a lot of people under appreciate the importance of stage of company.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.740]   There's such a different experience working in a startup versus a big company.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.540]   And so I think it's really important to think about what's the stage that you want to focus
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.540]   on.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.380]   I find there's like a really nice middle ground where you look for a series B or a series
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.780]   C company where it's not so early that it's likely to go out of business or it's going
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:01.420]   to be like so stressful all the time, but it's not like a meta or Google.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.300]   And so that's kind of interesting middle ground where it's still like a lot of upside, still
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   really fast moving.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.900]   And there's a lot of opportunity, but not boring and slow and big company.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.980]   So stage, I would think about the mission of the company.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.780]   If you like, look back on your life, you're going to be like, okay, look, I spent three
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.780]   years at this company.
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.260]   I moved this metric 5%.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.980]   And so like, you're not going to be that excited about that unless the mission is something
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.740]   that you really care about.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.460]   And moving that metric 5% leads to something that matters in the world.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.620]   As an example, Airbnb, they basically help people travel and go on better trips.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.300]   And if you ask people, what would you do?
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.180]   And this applies to your podcast a little bit.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.700]   Like what would you do if you had all the money in the world?
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.540]   Everyone says I travel and how cool is it to let people go on better trips, more trips,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.860]   have better experiences.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.620]   So there's a really meaningful mission there.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.860]   So and then the fourth is you just want to pay attention to the quality of the business.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.860]   Like is it going to work out?
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.860]   Is it going to grow?
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.900]   Is it going to, do they have to keep raising money forever?
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.740]   Are they going to be profitable?
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.580]   Especially important in today's climate.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.460]   And this is especially important because one of the, and we'll talk about how to stand
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.980]   out, one of the most powerful things you can do to give yourself a chance to get a better
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.900]   job is to have a logo or two from a company people recognize and respect, because that
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.460]   kind of pre-validates that you're solid.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.660]   Somebody else has interviewed you that you really trust.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.340]   And they've said, Chris is great.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.340]   We hired him.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   He worked here two years.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.340]   That like says a lot.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.060]   They may not necessarily be amazing, but at least it's some level that gives you a quick
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.020]   like, okay, I'll talk to this person.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.660]   So you want to work at a company that ends up being like, oh, wow, they worked that.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.700]   Now we were going to talk to them.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.700]   So those are the four.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.500]   I had an idea around that when I first wanted to get a job at a startup, I was like, I'm
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   going to pick a startup.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   That's really popular.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.100]   People will remember.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.540]   And I was like, oh, what company just raised a bunch of money?
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.700]   What's kind of in the zeitgeist.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.700]   It turns out I was wrong.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.060]   And that company ended up like not actually going on to raise any further funding.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.140]   But that was a hypothesis I had actually played out because five years later, even though
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.340]   that company was out of business, people were like, oh, I remember that company.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.020]   And so just the fact that I worked at this company that was a hot company at the time,
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.900]   even though it went out of business within a small niche of people was, was valuable.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:15.300]   I'll add on a couple thoughts to what you said, which is when you talk about stage and
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.780]   for people listening that aren't in tech, forget whether it's series a series B or something,
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.440]   it's just a small company, big company.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.460]   I think another way to think about that, those stages is kind of the speed at which you will
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.160]   learn and the type of learning you will do.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.180]   If you want to really hone your craft in a specific vertical, a later stage company is
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:41.580]   often going to be a place where you can really focus on one thing and really hone that, that
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:46.820]   skill, whether it's a set of managerial skills or, um, you know, anything at an early stage
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.060]   company, you're going to accelerate the speed at which you learn, but it might not be as,
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.820]   as kind of focused on craft, or at least so I've found because there's so many opportunities.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.140]   You might think you're doing one role in product, but you might also be doing a role in marketing.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.660]   And you might also be, you know, being the janitor sometimes, you know, I think I've
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.100]   had every role at a company except engineer at times.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.740]   And um, that, that happens at a smaller company.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:15.020]   So while you might trade off stability, you might learn a ton and a lot faster and be
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.040]   able to make transitions easier.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.660]   You know, if you're trying to jump into a new career, it's going to be a lot easier
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.620]   at a small company to say, Hey, I've never done this thing, but can I jump in and try
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.620]   it?
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.840]   And at a small company, someone's like, Oh, Lenny's really good at this thing.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.020]   Let's let Lenny do that.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.220]   And then you can kind of move, move across very, very easily.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.100]   That reminds me real quick story of when we sold our company to Airbnb, that's how I joined
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   Airbnb.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:46.420]   I went from being the CEO of the startup to a PM at Airbnb, and I felt such relief not
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.860]   having to think about all the things at the company and just focus on the one problem
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.020]   that we had to solve at Airbnb.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.060]   Like you would think that's painful, but it was so nice.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.800]   And I have to think about fundraising and I have to think about paying people salaries
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.260]   every month.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.260]   It was just like, cool.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.260]   You can solve this problem.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.920]   Life's going to be so much easier.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.700]   And so sometimes you want that.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700]   Sometimes you don't.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.980]   And my wife was the chief of staff at Lyft for a bunch of years.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.100]   She joined when the company was very small and she had, you know, the opposite experience,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.580]   which is she got to see everything.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.640]   And it was an amazing opportunity because the company was growing and she had all these
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.180]   different war, every hat there was.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.420]   And finally she was like, Oh, I'm spinning up a team to work on insurance.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.420]   I don't love that.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.080]   I'm spinning up a team to work on BD.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.460]   Oh, I'm like really interested in this.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.580]   Let's go do that.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.500]   And then she built a career in BD and loves doing BD and partnership stuff, but she never
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.300]   would have found that if she hadn't joined a company small enough to be able to do lots
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.100]   of stuff.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.980]   And then this is a little bit out of the way, because it's really hard.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.960]   It's not necessarily hard, but it's difficult to find these people.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.480]   But I think about trying to think about who you want to work for also.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.400]   So in any industry, there are people that are well known in their industry for, you
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.740]   know, you could look at like any conference for an industry, like who are the people speaking?
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.600]   Who are the people that are writing, who are the people you respect?
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.020]   And sometimes there might be a good opportunity to go learn from that person.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.880]   And it might not be the mission that you love, but it might be the best mentor you can find.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.360]   And so that's another thing that I think you could focus on when you're trying to figure
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.240]   out where to go, what's important to you.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.700]   It's like, do I care about the mission and will that fulfill me?
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.860]   Or do I care about the learning?
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.860]   Will that fulfill me?
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.740]   Or do I care about the resume boost?
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.380]   Will that fulfill me?
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.980]   All of those are options.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.540]   And so you just have to process them all.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.460]   Yeah, it reminds me of a quote that I don't know if I believe, but a lot of people believe
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.660]   it that you don't quit a job, you quit a manager.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.100]   And so to your point, finding a manager that you're really excited about and think you
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.580]   can learn from and want to work from, and that will champion you is really important.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:56.020]   And I think super underappreciated in my career, the biggest trajectory inflection was just
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.540]   one manager I had that just taught me a ton and just pushed me to do better.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.780]   And to your point, there's so much power and value in finding that person.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.900]   And if you can find, you know, the Japanese phrase, Ikigai, if you're familiar, if you
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.700]   can find that, obviously it's like the dream, right?
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.660]   It's, which is the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.340]   needs and what you could get paid for.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.140]   Like, you know, that's the dream.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.700]   It's like, you know, I'm learning as fast as I want at a company with the mission I
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.700]   want.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.120]   But I will say in my career, it's been very hard to find all of those things all the time.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.060]   And so you've got to prioritize and sometimes they morph into that, but you know, I wouldn't
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.460]   necessarily hold out for, for finding something that ticks every box.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.460]   I think one way to think about as long as you're getting closer to that, because you
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.620]   like your wife, you said she like, didn't know she wanted BD and the more experiences
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.600]   you have, the more you kind of narrow in on, okay, here's the thing I really want.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.260]   The other way to think about it is I realized this is my fourth career.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.260]   First I was a engineer.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.260]   Then I was a founder.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.100]   Then I was a PM and I'm whatever I am now, I was a newsletter.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.180]   And so there's always options to go change and go in different directions as you learn
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.620]   more about what you're excited about.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.780]   Like you're not stuck in the path that you chose.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.780]   Yep.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.260]   And you, I don't know about you, but I went through investment banker, management consultant,
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:25.180]   founder, uh, or employee PM BD, I did BD then founder, then, uh, went to Google and
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.180]   was a venture capitalist.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.460]   And then I was, you know, I went through a lot of, and now I'm a creator.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.260]   Um, I never knew half of those things more than three months before, you know, like some
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.060]   of them, I was like, I never knew I would be VC.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.180]   And then that opportunity arose.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.220]   I never thought I'd be a creator.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.840]   And then I started a podcast.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.820]   And so I think you don't need to know the future.
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.100]   I love this idea of where do you want to be with your life in 10 years?
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.340]   And if you, if you're in a career where that exercise is helpful, great, but I can tell
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:59.060]   you that where would my career be in 10 years, 10 years ago would be so wildly off from where
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.100]   it ended up that, you know, maybe it would have been a fun exercise, but it certainly
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.300]   wouldn't have been anywhere close to accurate.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.460]   I think to that point, there's so much value in a variety of experiences, like just doing
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.580]   a lot of different stuff later on ends up being really valuable to whatever you end
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.580]   up doing later.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.900]   I was just interviewing a newsletter guy who was like the number one tech newsletter on
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.900]   Substack.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.100]   And he's like, yeah, I launched a newsletter.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.780]   I got a thousand subscribers really quickly.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.780]   It just started working.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.660]   But in reality, I spent six years writing a book on engineering and then working at these
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.540]   jobs, learning a bunch of stuff.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.300]   So the thing you end up doing later ends up being built on the experiences you have.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.940]   And a lot of people don't understand the value of just trying a bunch of different stuff
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.980]   and not feeling like they have to be stuck.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.540]   Here's the thing I'm going to do for 10 years.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.020]   You found a handful of jobs.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:51.080]   My personal belief is that in today's world, you're much better off trying to narrow it
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.860]   down to three or four companies that you're really excited about and double down on your
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.860]   efforts to get in front of them.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.140]   And things I've done in the past are find every person that I can that knows them.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.260]   I've tried creating a presentation and sending it to them.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.460]   You could create a video about how excited you are, lots of things like that.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.660]   I've had this work for me, and I think it's underappreciated.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.660]   But as a founder, someone emailed me and said, I am so excited about your company.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.660]   Here's my ideas.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.040]   And I was like, I have to interview this person.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.700]   Anyone who would take more than an hour to put something creative together about my company
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.620]   is someone I will want to talk to.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.700]   And the bigger the company, the more it's like, well, they actually have to fit a role
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.220]   we're hiring for.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.180]   But I've interviewed people who I was like, I don't even have a role for you, but I just
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.340]   want to understand who you are, so I know where to slot you in later.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.860]   And so you can't scale that if you're interviewing, if you have a thousand companies you're excited
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.860]   about.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.160]   But if you have three, I'm like, go all in on those three before you try to find three
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.940]   more because I think that you can easily stand out by doing those things.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.660]   There's an episode I did with Sunil Gupta, who wrote a book called Backable.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.940]   And one time he just did customer research for the company and sent it to me.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.300]   He was like, hey, I interviewed your customers, here's what I learned.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.460]   If you were in sales, you could go close a customer and be like, hey, I just convinced
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.020]   a customer to sign up for you.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.580]   I just wanted to let you know.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.740]   Who doesn't want to interview a person who's closing deals before they even work there?
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.140]   So I think if you can go through the hard exercise of figuring out what you want, that's
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.140]   it.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.140]   So those are my tactics of standing out.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.620]   I'm curious at what you've seen to try to have candidates either who've applied to you
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.900]   or you've done yourself, kind of put yourself out there in different ways.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.580]   I think that's awesome advice.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.380]   It reminds me, I was teaching a course on Maven about product management and I was interviewing
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.100]   coaches to help me with the course.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.100]   And I had about 10 coaches.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.780]   I was interviewing them with someone else that was helping me out with the course.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.300]   And one of the coaches started her own sub stack, subscribed me to it, and then just
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.260]   started writing posts about how she's the perfect fit to coach this course.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:03.180]   And I was like, holy shit, we need to make sure that we talk to her for sure.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.460]   And we did, and it didn't work out there because she wasn't quite the fit, but I found something
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.460]   else to do with her.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.700]   And now she's a core part of my newsletter community, helps run a lot of the programs.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.820]   So yeah, I love that advice.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.900]   I think that's awesome advice.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.060]   I think generally the question is how do you stand out?
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.060]   How do you stand out?
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.860]   You do something really remarkable that gets someone's attention.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.860]   There's a lot of ways to do it.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:29.620]   I do a lot of angel investing and whenever I get a founder that makes a loom, "Hey Lenny,
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.260]   I really wanted to talk to you about the startup I'm building.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.540]   Here's why it's awesome."
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.300]   Like I watch them.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.340]   Most of the time I talk to them because they put in the effort and they do something unique.
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.840]   So I think it applies to investing too, pick like the people you really want on your cap
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.460]   table and do some extra.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.860]   I think broadly, like if you don't do anything like this, the things you need, because I'm
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.180]   with the job board, I review, I probably reviewed 3000 profiles of people that applied to join
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.100]   the job board or the collective.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.180]   And so the things like if you think about from the perspective of hiring manager, like
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.380]   what are they looking when they're scanning resumes?
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.420]   They're looking for logos that they recognize from companies that have pre-vetted that person
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.100]   in some form versus like a bunch of random companies they've never heard of.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.260]   So like you're not going to be able to do a lot about this, but this is what hiring
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.660]   managers look for.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.940]   Companies that they respect, that have kind of done one pass at this person and they're
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.980]   probably solid.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.100]   And then I think you mentioned this is just like impact, show some kind of impact that
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   you've driven.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.260]   So they're hiring you to have impact.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.660]   What impact have you had in your career?
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.940]   And so the more you can highlight those things, the better.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.380]   But if you don't have those things, your advice is, is great.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.580]   Do something, do something remarkable.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.180]   I love the idea of like a loom resume.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.540]   I wonder if you just like, you're, you know, send in your resume, but it's like, if you'd
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.180]   rather not look at another, I can imagine getting an email, if you'd rather not look
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:53.220]   at another 50th resume of the day, here's a five minute video of me walking through
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.220]   the highlights.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.380]   And by the way, you can put it on two X, if you want to get through it in two and a half.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.780]   I bet if I got an email that was like a little bit snarky, a little bit funny, but a little
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.740]   bit informative, that would be great.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.660]   And if you don't have those logos, it might be exactly what you need to get through that.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.660]   And then you could track that.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.660]   They watch the video too, which is cool.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   You get an email.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.660]   What about interviewing?
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.420]   Have you thought a lot about, you know, both on both sides of it, what people should be
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.900]   focused on versus not like, I don't know if I'm going to give you anything that you haven't
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.380]   heard before, other than just spent a lot of time preparing like a lot of interview
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.740]   questions or stuff you'll hear from a lot of different people.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.180]   So I think that's probably 90% of it.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.940]   Just spend a bunch of time preparing.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.180]   If you're interviewing at a big company, my sister was interviewing.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.780]   There's just like videos of all the interview questions they ask you online.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.780]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.620]   There's like courses you could take, like how to interview at Google.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.660]   And it's like all the questions they ask you, it's like you can go through all of them.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.500]   There's like a pool basically.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:53.420]   So there's like a lot of answers out there if you put in the time.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:59.380]   Another piece is, I guess, get good at telling your story and why you want to do this job,
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.220]   what you've done in your career, highlight the things that have had impact.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:10.380]   I think it's just like get good at pitching yourself and then you want to ask good questions
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.180]   of the interviewee, like stuff you hear all the time.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.820]   So I don't think there's anything dramatically new, but yeah, people want you to ask them
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.680]   questions because they want you to, they want to feel like you care about the company.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.660]   I've interviewed people who I'm like, why do you want to work here?
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.340]   And they're like, well, when I had a financial planning startup and they're like, I just
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.340]   love personal finance.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.980]   I'm like, that's why you want to work in the industry.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.820]   That's not why you want to work here.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.880]   So I would say, especially the smaller the company, but it probably works at any scale.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:41.740]   If you don't have a really solid answer for why you want to work at this company, I think
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.000]   that is tough for the other person to hear if they ask you.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.620]   And even if they don't, I'd try to slot it in because I think that's great.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.880]   And I would also try to come up with a personal question that I know this sounds like a lot
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.820]   of work, but try to come up with the best question you can ask someone.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.980]   Because whenever anyone asks me a really hard question, I remember that person.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.100]   That person really thought hard about this.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.060]   Or they transferred from interview to interview, they're like, oh, this person told me this
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.620]   is your biggest problem, uh, your company's facing.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.340]   And in the next one, they'd come in and say, Hey, I talked to the head of marketing and
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.560]   they said, this is the biggest challenge you're facing, you know, from a product standpoint,
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.980]   what are you guys doing to help the marketing team solve this?
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.580]   And it's like, wow, now you get to learn a lot of stuff, but it actually shows that you're
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.300]   actually trying to solve problems.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.340]   You're trying to be, you know, get more out of it.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.320]   So I just try to say, as the candidate, don't forget, you can ask questions and don't assume
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.220]   that the questions you ask are purely selfish.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.900]   I think that they can often leave people with a better impression of you and not just be
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.900]   information gathering.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.100]   It reminds me, one of the most interesting, so I have a TikTok account for my podcast.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.180]   It's called Lenny's podcast on TikTok.
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.860]   And I think it's like, my name is the actual handle.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:01.020]   And the most popular content is guests talking about their favorite interview question.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.300]   I ask that often at the end of my podcast episodes.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.660]   And so if you're looking for more questions to practice on, if you go to Lenny's podcast
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.700]   on TikTok, you'll sort, I think by views, you could probably see a bunch of really fun
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.740]   interview questions.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.220]   I will link to that show notes so people can find it.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.940]   Now let's say you get the job and this is something I know you've written about.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.340]   And I know it was actually a guest post, but I'm hoping you have some of the takeaways
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.060]   because they were fantastic about salary negotiation.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.100]   You know, I think it's something that people spend far less time on than they should.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.460]   And you highlighted a lot of that in the post you put out in your newsletter.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.380]   This post ended up being the most popular post of my newsletter of all time, partly
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:47.260]   because it got on Hacker News and got a ton of views and some recruiters did not like
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.260]   it.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.420]   And so I kind of, it's, it's good and bad, but I learned a ton from it.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.920]   And the reason I asked, so the author's Nia Drugova.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.420]   And the reason I asked her to write this is because I'm really bad at negotiation.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.000]   I don't even know if I've ever negotiated a salary.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.220]   And so I wanted to learn how to do this well.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:12.340]   And she, her full-time job basically is helping candidates negotiate their offers and help
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.380]   them find jobs.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.700]   So she's done this a ton.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.300]   And I'm not going to share, go through everything.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.340]   There's 10 kind of steps that she shares.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.060]   I'll share a few highlights, things that I thought were most interesting.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:29.440]   One is she super recommends you never give a number of what you think your salary should
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.540]   be or the range you're thinking about.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.980]   Her advice is just ask them, like, here's the question she suggests you ask.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.180]   Can you tell me the salary band for this level?
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.980]   I'm happy to let you know if it's within my range and we can discuss the specific number
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.580]   later once I've met the team.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.980]   That's her advice.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.380]   And that range ends up being really useful later when you start to negotiate.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.900]   That's tip one.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:00.460]   Tip two is to mine for Intel from your hiring manager and the recruiter into what they're
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.380]   looking for from this role.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.140]   Like what's the number one priority of the team right now?
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.820]   Why why is this role open?
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.740]   What's the biggest challenge for someone getting into this role?
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.140]   And the reason that's important is then you can mirror that back when you're pitching
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.140]   yourself.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.940]   Once you've got an offering, you want to counter, you can highlight, hey, here's what I'm going
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.300]   to help you with.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.700]   Here's what I'm going to do in this role.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.380]   Here's the challenges I'm going to tackle immediately.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.260]   And people are going to be like, holy moly, that's exactly what we need to know.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.780]   So the tip there is just mine, like ask these questions so that you have notes when you're
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.420]   actually pitching yourself later.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:41.100]   And then the third tip that I love is once you get an offer, her advice is don't counter
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.860]   it immediately and don't come back with, no, I think this is a better, more fair number.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.160]   Instead, you want to win the hearts and minds of the decision makers.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.820]   You want them to feel like, oh, my God, we need Chris in this company.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.940]   We got to pay him whatever he wants.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.340]   And the way you do that in her advice is after you get the offer schedule, try to get a meeting
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.820]   with a decision maker, like a director or VP or something.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.020]   Just like, hey, I just want to chat about this role.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:11.620]   And then in the discussion, ask questions about how they would want you to create meaningful
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.620]   impact.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.020]   Share some ideas maybe you've had about what you're going to do there.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:21.620]   And then maybe share obstacles that you have in accepting the offer and taking on the role.
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.180]   And generally just get them, try to get them excited about you joining the company.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.740]   And with that, then you can come back with like, okay, here, I've talked to everyone.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.380]   I understand the role better.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.500]   Here's where I think the offer should be.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.800]   And in theory, if you got them really excited to be like, oh, yes, yes, yes, let's do whatever
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.300]   we need to do.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.060]   I love that third tip because, uh, it's almost like, you know, come up with a plan.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.820]   You could even talk to the person that would be your manager and be like, Hey, you know,
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.180]   I know we're talking about salary negotiation already, but I just want to figure out like,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.340]   what's the 90 day plan.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.660]   What can I hit the ground running on?
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.420]   And you get them to like, buy into this is what this person's going to do.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.660]   And they're like, gosh, we already, we've already decided where first project, like,
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.660]   can we get going?
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.660]   Right.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.660]   Like get them in the hell.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.660]   Let's get going.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.660]   What are we doing?
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.660]   Negotiate?
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.620]   My, my, my other piece of advice to people is the salary is a component of your compensation,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.500]   but there's often a lot of flexibility in other places.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:18.260]   So it's not the only place to focus on some companies, uh, you know, things like vacation
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.380]   days are flexible.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.340]   Some they're just based on tenure or everyone gets the same.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.180]   Um, some educational reimbursement is one that you can focus on.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.380]   Um, others, I've found companies that say, you know, we're not really willing to flex
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.760]   on the salary and then, but I've heard from, you know, after I've worked there that they
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.400]   are willing to flex on a signup, a signing bonus, um, you know, they are willing to flex
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.440]   on various other aspects of compensation, like what your estimated bonuses, uh, I helped
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   a friend negotiate.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.740]   He said, you know, sometimes it's like, Oh, well now I know the band for the level, but
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.980]   why could I be at the next level?
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.940]   Like I'm not trying to tell you how much to pay me.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.740]   I'm trying to tell you that I'm at the next level.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.900]   And they said, well, we're, we're not confident you're at that level.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.900]   And he said, great.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.760]   How about we have a check-in in six months and you tell me what I need to demonstrate.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.060]   I will demonstrate that.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.020]   And if I will, would you retroactively update my compensation?
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.640]   As if I came in at that level, you're not willing to believe I'm there now, let me prove
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.100]   it to you.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:19.780]   And he set out a series of things that they needed to demonstrate three months in.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.060]   He checked in with them and said, am I on track to demonstrate these things, which by
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.960]   the way, genius move, uh, for this person, because it's so much easier for your manager
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.500]   to say you're on track for something than actually getting your promotion put through
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.180]   or getting your, you know, compensation adjusted.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.500]   But then when you check in six months later and you say three months ago, you said I was
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.500]   on track.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.940]   Like we haven't had any conversation to the contrary.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.980]   So like, if I'm not getting this, then what, why were you telling me that?
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.340]   So you're kind of similar to how you said, getting the buy-in before you negotiate, you're
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.780]   getting the buy-in that you're already going to get approved for this change.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:58.540]   So I just think there's a lot of wiggle room about things, um, other than your salary.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:03.060]   And so if, if a company's not willing to flex there, go down all the other paths, it's still
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.060]   so hard to do.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.860]   It's a negotiation thing.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.220]   I worked with Andy Ratcliffe for a while.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.220]   He was the CEO of wealth threat.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:13.380]   His advice was to always just put the decision in someone else's hand and say, what, what
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.900]   do you think is fair?
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.780]   And he said 90% of the time, uh, they do what's fair and 10% of the time they don't.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.620]   And you know, that they're trying to kind of screw you over and maybe that's just not
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.620]   the right fit.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.500]   Um, I I'm trying to think, you know, I, I always like sharing negotiation advice, even
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.180]   if it's not relevant to salary.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.660]   Um, but you could basically say, here's all the data I've collected about what this role
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.980]   should be compensated.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.540]   I, I, I I'd like to be compensated fairly with this data.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.540]   Here's the data.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.540]   Let me know what you think.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.860]   And like force it on them to make a fair decision.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.660]   I feel like, you know, that that's maybe depending on the circumstance, uh, a good last tactic
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.260]   or a starting point, but I like, and have used many times the tactic of letting someone
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.740]   else decide what's fair and not have to throw out the number first.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.740]   I like it.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.740]   Okay.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.740]   So we've gotten hired.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.500]   We're now at a company.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.820]   And I want to focus on something that applies to everyone actually working at the company
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.820]   they're at.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.220]   Um, there is a lot we could cover here.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.940]   I don't want to go through every possible thing, but there are a few things that I think
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.660]   you might have, you know, outsized impact on the conversation about.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.780]   And the first one is actually about having impact in an organization, uh, and hopefully
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.060]   a little bit about how to get promoted on the way.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.340]   But I know you kind of believe those two things are both similar and very different.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.120]   So what do you, what do you think people should be optimizing for when they're working at
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.380]   any company?
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.820]   If I had to pick one thing, I would say have impact on the company in their bottom line.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.780]   I think if you think about it, like, why the hell are they paying you a salary?
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.660]   It's to have impact on their business, to help them grow faster.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.340]   And so if there's any one thing that you can just always come back to, if you deliver more
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.540]   impact, you will do better.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.820]   I think that's like 90% of your success at a company.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.740]   And there's like, people need to know about your impact.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.900]   You need to be working on things that matter.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.500]   Like you could have an impact on like a leaf at the end of the tree of the business, or
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.140]   you could have impact on the core number one goal.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.460]   And that's a big difference, but I'd say if you had to pick anything, it's just, how can
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.460]   I deliver more impact?
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:18.300]   And it's especially important for PMs who are basically marshaling the resources of
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.780]   their team.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.660]   And the more you focus on how can our team have more impact, the better everyone on the
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.660]   team does.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.260]   Let's pretend you just started a new company and you're like, how do you find the way you
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.700]   can have that impact?
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.060]   Well, there's one way I think about it.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.660]   I kind of think about Lord of the Rings and the Eye of Sauron.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.500]   If you think about like, what's the most important project to the CEO right now, I think about
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.500]   that as the Eye of Sauron.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.820]   He's looking at that, or she's looking at that, and that's going to be like so stressful
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.820]   and difficult.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.300]   They're like right on you, on your butt.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.460]   And then the alternative is you could be working in a shire where nobody cares what's going
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.460]   on.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.500]   Like you could have the most amazing product and everyone's like, that's nice, good job.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.940]   I would say generally you want to optimize like on average to be like, not in the Eye
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.060]   of Sauron, but right off to the side.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.340]   Work on something that's really important, but not like the most important thing to the
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.860]   company, at least for a long time, because you just get burnt out being in that thing
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.580]   that's like the number one most important product.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.420]   So that's just like a general piece of advice.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.620]   Work on something really important, but maybe not the most important thing.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.260]   Just a tip there.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.340]   Impacts the most important thing.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:30.100]   I've seen you write about how to get promoted effectively and that impact matters.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.140]   So any comments on that?
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.620]   If you're like, why am I not getting promoted?
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.900]   It usually means that you're not delivering enough impact or people don't have confidence
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.900]   that you will deliver the impact that you need to at a higher level.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.380]   So if you think about working backwards from a hiring manager or the company, thinking
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.940]   about show you promote Chris, basically you need to give them confidence that you can
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:56.360]   handle more scope, more responsibility, more, more impact.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.300]   So how do you show that one deliver more impact?
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:06.420]   Find ways to hit more ambitious goals, maybe lead a really important project, work on something
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.620]   closer to the eye of Sauron, something higher visibility and more important, maybe help
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.640]   the company save money or run more efficiently.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.420]   Just like find ways where you can show that you've done things that are really important
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.420]   to the company.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:24.980]   Now two is part of the idea of a promotion is people are going to give you more scope,
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.460]   more responsibility, and again, they have to have confidence that you can handle it.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.460]   How do you do that?
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.580]   You take on more scope, more responsibility before you are promoted to show people, look
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.060]   at me, I can handle this.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:40.500]   So you want to find ways to take on work, maybe your manager's doing and knock it out,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.140]   take on a project that someone else is doing while they're out and do it for them.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.800]   Pick a really ambitious project that's just going to take a year or two.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.760]   It's going to be really important to the company.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.100]   Take the reins on like a visioning exercise and just like, look at me, I did this thing.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.100]   This is awesome.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.740]   So, and I think what's important here is a lot of people only get promoted after they've
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.580]   shown they can handle this additional scope.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.600]   And so you've got to look for things, you've got to find opportunities to take on more
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   scope.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:13.060]   Those are two, there's five more in this post that I wrote, so let me just run through them
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   pretty quick.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.960]   Three is part of the reason you get promoted is there's this gap that your manager has
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   identified.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:27.120]   Like Chris needs to work on a better deadline setting or, or, uh, hiring.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.560]   There's usually like a gap that keeps you from the next level.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.440]   And it's really important that you and your manager are aligned.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.640]   Here's the gaps that keep you from the next level.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.920]   Like you shared this story about your friend, am I on track for this next level?
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.120]   There's usually like a set of things that your manager gives you feedback on, usually
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   in your performance review, a tip that I would suggest that I found really powerful, um,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:54.480]   either as a manager or as a report is when you have a performance review, align with
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.760]   your manager on like a spreadsheet of things that you plan to do in the next, say six months
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.840]   until the next performance review, um, create basically a roadmap.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.600]   Like I'm going to work on becoming a better public speaker.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.640]   I am going to get deadlines 90% of the time.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:15.440]   I'm going to update our JIRA, uh, to be up to date by the end of Fridays, make a list
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:20.240]   of the things that are the biggest, uh, things you can actually do that'll bring you to the
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.480]   next level.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.680]   And then meet with your manager slash report every month and review the status of each
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   of those things.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.160]   And it becomes this little roadmap where you're aligned on here's the things say Chris is
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.000]   working on and how they're going.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.800]   So that by the time you get to the performance review, you, uh, you don't, you're unsurprised
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.440]   like here, we did five of these things.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.240]   We didn't get to these things.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.240]   So that's where you're at.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.740]   So demonstrate you've addressed the gap for finding someone that can champion you.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.800]   That's often really powerful at a company, get someone really excited about you and can
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.600]   champion you inside of these calibration sessions.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   That's really powerful.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.560]   Um, five is you want to pay attention to what gets promoted at the company.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.920]   A lot of companies have these like gray area things that matter a lot that you may not
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   be aware of.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.360]   So just look at people who are getting promoted and just understand, look for things that
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   they're doing.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   Maybe that you're not doing.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   Maybe you have to be friends with the CEO.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   I don't know.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.480]   Maybe you have to be really good at communication that really matters at the company.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.680]   And then two more, um, something that's way underappreciated is you just need to ask to
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   get promoted.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.900]   Sometimes, sometimes managers don't know you want to be promoted.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.840]   So simplest thing you could do is just like, Hey, I would love to be promoted to the next
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840]   level.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.480]   What do I need to do to get there and what are my gaps?
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.080]   And that often leads to the biggest impact on getting promoted.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.240]   And then the last idea and tip is just sometimes you need to leave and work somewhere else.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.880]   Sometimes you're just like stuck in a rut and you just have, I don't know, certain reputation.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.340]   Your manager is just not good at championing you.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.000]   So sometimes you're not going to get promoted and it's time to try some other place where
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.320]   you kind of start with a clean slate.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.280]   I remember it was so depressing, but, uh, when I was a venture capitalist, the role
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:07.300]   of like, I guess, non general partner, we were told it was like, this is a terminal
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   position.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.240]   Like they were just very transparent.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.440]   They're like the expectation for this job is not that you will get promoted to be a
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.080]   general partner of the fund.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.520]   That is just how it works.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.680]   Uh, and we just want you to know that.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   So you don't have those expectations.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.760]   And it was like very clearly set.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.920]   I think it was a little depressing at times because the word terminal position just sounds
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.200]   like, you know, going nowhere, but I appreciate the honesty.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.960]   I appreciate the transparency.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.600]   The one thing that I learned and you, you reminded me in what you said was a lot of
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.020]   times in order to get promoted, you don't need to meet the expectations of your role.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.840]   You need to demonstrate that you can handle the next role.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.560]   And I think I'd always thought, you know, as someone who hasn't studied this or been
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.360]   a prolific manager at any point in time, I always thought, Oh, when someone could do
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.800]   their job really well, you move to the next level.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.280]   But it's actually in a lot of companies, it's when someone could demonstrate that they can
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.760]   do the job that they want to get promoted to is when that happens.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.220]   And so it's really important to understand what do I need to, if I'm a level five manager
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.080]   and I want to be a level six director, it's like, what do I need to demonstrate to be
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.680]   a director?
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.120]   Not what do I need to do as a manager?
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.240]   Because sometimes you need to do the next level's job to get the promotion.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   And that's how it works in calibration.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.540]   When you're looking at someone's level, there's like a lot of big companies have these ladders
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.640]   and they tell you what each level needs to achieve.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.680]   And so if someone's going to be promoted to say L seven, there's like, here's what L seven
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.880]   has to be good at, at each of these things.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   And that's a manager.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.880]   Look at is Chris ready for all these things in L seven.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.880]   Makes sense.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.120]   Like your job is going to now be that you want to be confident that they can handle
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   that.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.560]   And if that ladder is not public, ask for it.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.680]   There are some companies that might not publish it on any internal doc, but you could say,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.560]   Hey, my boss, could you please show me the career ladder for my role or could the requirements
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.120]   of the next level of my role?
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.200]   And hopefully you can get that and understand it so you can work towards it.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.640]   Yeah, I've actually, I've actually collected the career ladders at 20 something companies.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.800]   And I have this doc that we'll link to in the show notes that has all their level names
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.920]   and then the attributes that they live for product managers specifically that they look
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.160]   for to promote people.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.480]   We'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.600]   One of the things I tell people is they think that to be promoted, that that strategy is
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   to always kind of do whatever your boss wants and never push back.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.720]   And you know, I am someone who probably has never adhered to that, maybe to my own demise
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.700]   and kind of pushed back too much.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.720]   What do you think is the right balance of, you know, saying no?
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.120]   And what's the value of saying no, as opposed to kind of always being willing to do what
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.560]   other people want?
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:45.080]   As a PM and just as a leader in general, like you're the person that needs to say no, because
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   you're kind of responsible.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.560]   And I'm thinking from a PM perspective, product manager perspective, you're kind of responsible
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.240]   for what a whole team of people does.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.200]   And so part of your like, you could almost say your job is to say no so that you can
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.880]   say yes to the stuff that is really important.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.080]   So it's really important to say no to push back.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   It's still very hard, especially if your manager is like, hey, we need to do these things.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:13.320]   So I wrote this post with, I think, five ways you can say no that and many of them are you
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.240]   say yes to say no.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.760]   So I'll share some of these quotes that you can steal.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.620]   And they're also in this post.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.560]   So the first two is someone asked you to do something.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.680]   You could say yes, but here's what's going to have to change.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.680]   If we do that, should we move forward?
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.360]   And oftentimes they're like, yes, let's go ahead.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.640]   Or otherwise they're like, no, shoot, I don't want to, I don't want to deprioritize that.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   Forget that.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   So that's one trick.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   Two is you could say yes, but not right now because we got to stay focused on X because
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.840]   of X, Y, Z.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.960]   Do you agree with that?
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.860]   Or do you think we should deprioritize that?
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.800]   So that often works really well because it basically communicates, again, here's like
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.440]   a very clear trade off and why it's important.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:03.960]   Another way you could say no is no, but how about we do X, Y, Z instead of that?
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.560]   And it's going to achieve a similar outcome.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:10.600]   Basically, this is when you have a better idea, but you want to communicate here's something
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.680]   we could basically do exactly what you want, but here's a better approach to doing that.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   Another way you could say no is no, but there's something there.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.640]   There's like something to this idea.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.840]   How about we explore this a little bit further?
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.280]   And here's the next step that I suggest.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.320]   And then the fifth way you could approach is just like, no, I don't think this is a
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.560]   good idea.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.940]   Here's why.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.940]   Would you agree?
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.420]   Or is there something I'm missing?
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.680]   So first off, I wish I had read this post earlier in my career because I was like, no,
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   that's so crazy.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   Why would we do that?
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.920]   I could have used this.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.840]   I was never good at, you know, politics is the wrong word, but I was never good at a
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.200]   lot of this stuff.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:55.840]   And one of the tactics I shared when we spoke on your show was that like, I was so confrontational
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.400]   about things because I was so used to working at a company that I started where everyone
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:07.180]   always knew that obviously I was always optimizing for the company because like it didn't matter.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:11.320]   And then I joined a company where I wasn't in charge and, and you know, it turns out
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.440]   that in big companies, there are a lot of people who are optimizing for themselves way
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.760]   more than the company.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   I didn't really realize that.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.040]   I was like, everyone's got it optimized for the company.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.320]   That's the most important thing.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.200]   That's how I lived in my last companies that I've run.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.600]   And so a tactic that helped me when I was pushing back on people, colleagues, bosses,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   is just always making sure that I told people, Hey, I'm thinking about this from the perspective
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   of trying to maximize the impact from the company.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.200]   And because sometimes I'd say, Oh, well that we shouldn't do that.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   That's not a good idea.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.360]   And people would be like, Oh, well you just don't want to do more work or you want to
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.280]   focus on this thing you're more excited about.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.160]   And that wasn't true, but the more I just transparently said, here's how I'm thinking
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   about this.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   Here's what I'm focused on.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   It just helped so much.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.440]   And so just stating your intent before you push back.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.960]   So people know where you're coming from.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.200]   It was very helpful for me and hopefully helpful for some others.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   I think we all fall into this.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.700]   Like people are going to read our mind and know exactly why we think no, or why we're
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.000]   saying this.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.400]   And it turns out people cannot read your mind real quick before we, we talk about what happens
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.440]   when you move on from a job, you know, part of getting things done as being productive.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.280]   I've talked a lot about time management.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   I'm a nerd.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.080]   We don't have to go super deep because I've done a few episodes, but any few tactics you
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.480]   want to pull out on how you manage your time and get a lot done and be effective with your
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.320]   output so that you do have impact.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.520]   And it's especially important in this world of writing and podcasting full time.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.760]   I'll share a few things that worked really well when I was working full time and I don't
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.960]   think anything will be revolutionary, but, but these things really work for me at least.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:51.640]   One is I blocked three hours on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays on my calendar.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:56.740]   And I had, I called the meeting, do not book or I will slap you.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.080]   And it made people laugh, but it really worked really well.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.680]   People did not book over these slots.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.320]   They were like, okay, I get it.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.640]   And so find some like funny way to have a block where people know, okay, I see he's
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.240]   like really serious about this time.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:13.000]   Let me leave him alone because I'm sure you've talked about deep work and the importance
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.720]   of focus and all that.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.660]   But I find that that's so important for creative work.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:24.040]   In my new life of newsletter or podcast person, I, uh, I have no meetings until 3:00 PM.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   That's my rule.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.280]   And only at three, I have meetings and things like this.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.840]   So that helps them too is just what's like an app or something that keeps you focused
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   when you're working.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.160]   I use this app called centered dot app.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.360]   That's kind of like brain FM, which is this like binaural beat music meets a to do list
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.880]   meets like a playlist.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.880]   So once you're ready to work, click play and music starts and it's like Lenny, you're starting
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.160]   with your newsletter posts and then you can knock them off as you're working through them.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.480]   And it works really well for me.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.640]   Something I'm trying right now that works well is picking one highlight of the day.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.440]   One top goal for the day.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.120]   There's this book I'm reading right now called make time.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   Oh yeah.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120]   It's called make time.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.120]   Sprint guys.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.200]   And they're, that's one of their key things.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   Just like pick a highlight.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.320]   What's going to be like a highlight of your day that you look back on that I did this
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   thing.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.320]   You'll feel good no matter what else happened.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   So I'm trying to do that.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.480]   And that's been working really well.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.200]   Another tip is to have a, a waiting for list.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.820]   It's very like getting things done, David Allen style, where I have all these open threads
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.640]   of people doing stuff.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.080]   And I keep a list of who am I waiting for on these things so that the to do, even though
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.600]   it's on someone else's plate, I don't lose track of.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.640]   And the way I do it as in my to do list, I just have W for Chris and then it's like record
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.140]   podcast or whatever.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.920]   So that ends up being really helpful.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.880]   The other interesting thing I find is procrastination.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.320]   Like it has a bad rap.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.360]   I find that sometimes I procrastinate on a hard thing, but I get a lot of other smaller
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360]   things done.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:57.160]   So I like work through this list of stuff that isn't important, but I get them done
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.480]   and there's value to just procrastinating off the thing that's like really hard because
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   you still get other stuff done.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:08.240]   So I try to channel my procrastination and get stuff done that, uh, I need to get that
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   anyway.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.800]   I think about there's deep work and I don't know if you could say flow state and deeper
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.360]   or the same thing, but I think that sometimes it just takes a little bit of momentum to
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.520]   get into that flow state.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.800]   So it's like, ah, I got this really big, hard thing.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.440]   Do I want to sit down and do all this research and you know, or do I want to knock off a
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   few quick things?
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.000]   And then I'm like, oh yeah, I'm making progress.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.640]   I just cleaned up this, this set of my emails.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.760]   I just, you know, got this one thing done and now I'm feeling really productive and
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:40.040]   at least for me, once I start feeling productive, it's just so much easier to be more productive,
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   get more done.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.320]   Then I find myself like, oh, I just wish I could work longer.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   I've got so much.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.000]   So, um, I love making momentum in that.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.760]   So those are some really great tips.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.560]   I won't share too many of mine because I've done an episode with Ali Abdaal on productivity
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:57.440]   on with Cal Newport on deep work and, uh, with Laura Vanderkam on time management.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.480]   So if you're new here, there's a lot in the archives to go check out.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:06.000]   So go check those out, but let's talk about moving on because, you know, you said, uh,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   you've left here.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.760]   You're no longer a full time employee with a company you're doing on your own.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.000]   How did you make that decision to move on?
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.960]   How did you create space for it?
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:22.000]   Um, and, and did you ever think about ways to test out, uh, going out on your own before
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   before that?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   That's a lot.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.760]   So, uh, maybe, maybe start with, uh, how did you even kind of decide maybe I should move
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   on.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.760]   I'm ready for a big change.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.640]   If you look at my resume, I'm like a serial monogamist of career.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.400]   I worked at my first company for nine years, then at a startup, that was the short stint
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.120]   year and a half, and then worked at Airbnb for seven years.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.360]   And uh, I, like, I never thought I'd stay there that long.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.520]   They bought our startup and I'm like, oh, I'm going to be out of here in three years
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.880]   when I'm going to start another company.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.400]   And then seven years later, here I am.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.720]   And along the way, I thought about leaving, but it never felt like it was time.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.720]   It was always interesting.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.000]   There's always reasons to keep working there and try new stuff.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.920]   Um, and the way that it happened that I left is I took a sabbatical, uh, they gave me a
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   sabbatical.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.900]   So I took three months off, uh, right around when I was reaching seven years and about
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:19.240]   halfway through, I remember just opening my email for the first time.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.440]   So a month and a half in the work email, just to see what was going on.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.480]   And I just had this like, heart sinking feeling where I'm like, I don't care about this at
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   all anymore.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.880]   What the heck is, what is going on here?
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.680]   And I just, I don't want to think about any of this ever again.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.000]   And so that was kind of an important moment where I was like, wow, maybe, maybe I'm not
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.560]   excited about this work anymore.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:47.480]   I still came back to Airbnb after that and kind of wanted to feel out, am I ready for
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:52.520]   some new, like, am I, am I, is there like a new team?
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   Maybe I could work on a new project that would get me excited.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.180]   But basically the way it felt as I got there and I immediately felt like my heart was done
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.800]   with that work, but my brain wasn't ready to move on.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.360]   It was like, maybe there's something more interesting.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   Maybe there's a new manager.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.360]   Maybe there's something else I could work on.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.400]   So it took a month basically to think about and talk to people about other roles, other
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.520]   teams, other opportunities.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.400]   But I'd say at the end of the month, it was like, nope, nothing that gets me very excited.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.480]   It's time to do some new.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   And we'll say it's rare.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.760]   It's like very fortunate to be able to have that feeling of like, I can leave and things
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   aren't going to, I'm not going to go bankrupt and live on the street.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.600]   So it's a really, I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to even have thought that,
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.840]   but I did.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.160]   And so what I decided to do is I'm going to leave Airbnb and I'm going to give myself
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.240]   six months to think about what I want to do next.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   And something that really helped there.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   And here's a tip.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   When you're thinking about something like this is to figure out a personal runway of
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.080]   like how much it's going to cost you to take six months off and just budget that like it's
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:56.840]   going to be $30,000, take six months off to pay all the things I'm paying.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.400]   And just knowing that number ahead of time gives you so much less stress knowing I'm
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.760]   like burning through money as I'm not working, but I've already accounted for that.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.480]   And it's like maybe sitting in a bank account somewhere and that gives you more freedom
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.040]   to just explore and not have to worry about, oh my God, I need to find something as soon
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   as possible.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.240]   And I'll just highlight the importance of actually putting it in an account.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.560]   It's one thing to be like, well, I know I have enough savings to take time off.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:25.000]   And this is something that I'm actively thinking about now that I'm grading this business on
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   my own.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.240]   Just like you did it.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.520]   It's like actually putting it somewhere.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.600]   It takes it one step further.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.040]   I think it has even more it because a lot of it's emotional.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.080]   It's not always rational.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.640]   It's like, gosh, I don't have a salary coming in.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:44.480]   I almost went as far as to take the salary, put it in a bank account and automate the
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.480]   transfers.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.220]   So it like simulated as if I was getting my paycheck so that I felt like it was not as
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.140]   scary to not have that stability.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.480]   The other thing that I found really powerful during this time, in addition to the personal
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.340]   runway is there's so little structure when you aren't working.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:07.640]   Like I worked for, I think 19 years in our, since like, you know, 18 years old and I never
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.100]   take a break and it's so weird to not have structure in your life.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.920]   That's like, there's deadlines, there's no deadlines.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.400]   There's no like, I need to achieve this thing by then.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.960]   Like you could work all day.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   You could not work at all.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.120]   Nobody's going to say anything.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.880]   And it's hard to work without that.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.200]   Like it feels like it shouldn't be, but it really is.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.320]   So what I created structure for myself and the way I did that is I created these little
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:35.120]   sprints where every two weeks I wrote down, here's the three goals I have for the next
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.080]   two weeks that are work goals and three personal goals.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.840]   And I emailed that to three friends that became kind of this like personal board of directors
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.280]   kind of group.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.800]   And I had no expectation they'd reply.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.000]   I didn't need them to reply.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.880]   I just found that just emailing them, here's what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.360]   And then circling back in two weeks and sharing, here's how I did, created so much accountability
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.760]   and gave me some focus for these two weeks.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.320]   And I ended up doing that for a year straight.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.280]   Every two weeks I did a little check-in in one weekend, just to like, here's how it's
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.760]   going so far per sprint.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.920]   And that was so powerful and important to where I ended up just creating a little bit
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.200]   of structure.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.260]   And that email list ended up being like 30 people eventually, just because it became
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.480]   a cool way to update my friends on what I was up to.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.320]   And just like, Hey, you want to join this list I'm doing.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:25.200]   And so that's a tip in your, if you don't have enough structure around your, your free
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.600]   time.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.640]   I think one thing interesting that I've thought a lot about recently is, you know, as a creator,
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.240]   which you, you know, you left and you started, I think the first thing out of, out of Airbnb
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   was a newsletter.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.880]   I think a lot of people are kind of scared.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.760]   I don't know what my thing is, but I love the idea of experimenting with creation.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.880]   And I think depending on the company you work at, you might be able to kind of experiment
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.080]   before you leave.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.960]   I would encourage everyone to, you know, get it cleared to make sure that, you know, your
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.920]   company isn't going to own whatever you're working on, you know, clear that don't do
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:59.080]   it on your work computer, do it on your personal computer and all those good things.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.400]   But how did you start to think about, because I think, I think one thing for me that was
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.320]   strange was I had all this knowledge about optimization, like, but I, it didn't really
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.760]   click that it could actually be a thing that I do.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.560]   That could be a business that could be how I, you know, spend my days.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.920]   Do you have any advice for someone who hasn't quite figured that out?
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.680]   And they're like, I would love to do that, but I don't know what my thing is, or I don't
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.360]   know how I could test if it really is a thing.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.880]   I think there's two things I'll cover there.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.400]   One is, can you start something while you're at a company?
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.480]   My experience is, I, it's so hard.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.640]   I found that like, I'm done at the end of the day, working at a full-time job, like
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:40.960]   Airbnb, I'm just like, I have no brain energy left to experiment with writing awesome posts
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.080]   or a podcast or anything like that.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.200]   It's like very, very hard.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.600]   And I think the advantage folks like you and I have that are doing this full-time is there's,
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.120]   I find there's a strong correlation between quality and, and how well it does.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.840]   And so we just, and time, sorry, quality and time, there's a strong correlation between
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.840]   how much time you put into something and the quality of that work.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.920]   And people that have a full-time job are not going to have as much time as someone like
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.840]   you and I that are doing this full-time.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.680]   And so I think it's just really hard to try something like this for real when you have
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.840]   a full-time job.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.120]   So don't feel weird if like, oh my God, everyone's writing all these side projects and writing
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.280]   things and starting podcasts, like very, very hard.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:25.740]   When I started writing, like I hadn't really written anything public in my life before
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.920]   I started this newsletter, just experiment with it.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.580]   And to segue to the second question is like, how did I discover this path?
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.280]   I just had like stuff I wanted to get out of my head when I left Airbnb, just to make
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.120]   sure I don't forget it in case I start another company.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.920]   And so I just started, I wrote a Medium post, it did shockingly well.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.440]   I wrote a few more posts, they did well.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.440]   And then just kind of in the sprint goal thing that I talked about, I just had like every
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.800]   sprint just like write one more post, see how that goes.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.920]   So I just kept along that path and the whole time I was like, why am I doing this?
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.520]   I thought I was going to start a company, like why am I spending time writing?
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.960]   This is such a not going to go anywhere.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.080]   Time invested, my wife's like, what are you doing writing?
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:08.480]   You're not a writer, I thought you wanted to start a company, why don't you spending
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.960]   time on that?
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:14.840]   And I had this really important conversation with a friend who pointed out, okay, you really
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:19.160]   enjoy this thing, people seem to value it, that's like very rare, you found like some
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.960]   kind of product market fit.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.640]   Maybe this goes somewhere if you keep at it.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.680]   And even if there's no way you could ever make money with it, maybe just double down
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.680]   on that.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.200]   And forget the startup stuff for now and just see where it goes.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   And that's exactly what I did.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.640]   I just started writing every week, launched a newsletter just to create a little time
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:40.160]   pressure to post something once a week, and did that for nine months every week.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.080]   And then at that point, I'm like, huh, this is still going great, growing fast.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   Maybe I could charge for this.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.600]   I launched a paid plan that went well.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.800]   And I just kept following that path.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.280]   And so it was very one step at a time without any master plan.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.960]   And you say it just kind of grew.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.880]   How big is the newsletter now?
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.640]   It's about to hit 300,000 subscribers.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.880]   Yeah, it's a number one newsletter and massive number one business newsletter on Substack.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.200]   And growing fast.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.280]   I love it.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.120]   It's kind of the core of my, my work and then the podcast kind of spun out of that.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.880]   Well, I've enjoyed it thoroughly.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.240]   In fact, in preparation for this interview, I was a little stressed out because I was
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.800]   thinking, gosh, I'm leaving my job, but I really do love building products.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.040]   And I was like, scrolling through trying to like, look at all the posts you've written.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.520]   And I was like, gosh, wow, I really want to build this impactful project.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.280]   Like, I really want to make another roadmap.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.920]   So you know, now I'm like, I've got to channel that energy.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.840]   And for everyone listening, now I'm focused on what kinds of products and experiences
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.520]   and communities and all of the things that I build around what I've done with all the
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.520]   hacks.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.760]   It's hard to come there, but it's been it was very helpful.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.680]   So thank you for that.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.960]   Anything we missed in this process, we went through, you know, finding a job standing
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.720]   out, running through, you know, working and having impact and moving on.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.280]   I know you've written so many great newsletters.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.400]   So I want to make sure we hit on something that you've thought about.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.760]   There's something that I thought would be good to share, which is around managing up.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.560]   I find that whenever I tweet about managing up, it's like the most popular tweets ever.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.520]   Really people really want to learn how to manage up better.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.180]   And there's one thing that I'll share that I found really effective, which is around
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.520]   how to keep your manager aware of what you're up to.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.480]   There's a lot of value in your manager knowing what's on your mind, what's important to you
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.280]   right now, what can they help with.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:31.080]   So something that I found to be really powerful is an email that I call the state of me email.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.640]   So it'd be like the state of Lenny email, I call it the subject line state of Lenny
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   and in the email and I email this to my manager every Monday or every Friday, once a week,
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.560]   I write out, here's blockers that I need your help with 1, 2, 3.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.280]   Here are my current priorities, 1, 2, 3.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.440]   And then here's what's on my mind in general, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.360]   And then at the end, just like, let me know if there's anything that I can clarify if
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.600]   you have any questions about anything.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.200]   And I found that one email created so much value because my manager knew what I was up
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   to.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.080]   They could tell me, Hey, why are you working on that?
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.360]   They can, they can unblock stuff that I'm blocked by, which a lot of times I don't know
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   that you're blocked by some.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.960]   And then generally there's stuff on your mind, like, Hey, I'm thinking about this project,
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.240]   this person's thinking about leaving this competitors doing this thing.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.400]   So just that one email can make a huge dent and really simple, just like blockers, priorities,
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.680]   what's on your mind, send your manager that once a week and honestly great things are
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680]   going to happen.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.280]   I mean, I said earlier, you don't want to be always saying yes to your manager, but
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:38.800]   making your manager's life easier is certainly something that is a very valued attribute
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.800]   of an employee.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.160]   So making it, making it easier for them to understand everything you're working on, making
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.320]   it easier for them to say, I love this email idea.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.640]   It's like, Oh no, actually work on this, that will let you have more impact.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.960]   So love it.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.520]   And this has been so helpful.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.000]   I, you know, I wish that some of these things I had taken before, but like I said, you know,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.240]   I didn't know where I'd be now, who knows where I'll be in 10 years.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.320]   And certainly many people listening will hopefully get a lot of value out of this and out of
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:10.680]   the newsletter before we go, I do want to ask you, is there a place that you feel like
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.880]   you could give some recommendations to people who might find themselves there on whether
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.720]   it's eating activities, drinks, something to do?
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Sure.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.920]   I'm not, I'm not like the guy people go to for advice on what to do in a place, but yeah,
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.400]   you gave me a heads up on this question.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.120]   And so here's what I got for you.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.080]   I live in Marin, California, which is North of San Francisco.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.200]   And so here's a little, there's a little agenda.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.760]   If you can want to come to Marin, I'd say stay at this hotel called Cavallo Point Lodge.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.320]   It's going to blow your mind.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.280]   Then go take a little walk around Sausalito along the water.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.960]   There's this boardwalk that goes along the water.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.120]   Then just grab lunch at a restaurant there.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.680]   There's like these piers with these beautiful seafood restaurants.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.600]   Then take a drive to San Francisco across the Yule game bridge.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.040]   There's this art piece called the wood line in the Presidio that is this like curvy piece
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.440]   of wood that you could walk along amongst these huge eucalyptus trees.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.600]   And that's right across the bridge.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   Then you can go to say Fillmore Street or Chestnut in the Marina and get a coffee, buy
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.080]   some nice fancy things in some of the nice stores.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Then I'd say drive back to Marin and maybe to Fairfax, which is further North, rent a
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.720]   mountain bike, find some trails.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.440]   Mountain biking was invented in Fairfax and there's this huge mountain, Mount Ham, there's
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.580]   like a thousand trails you could go on.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:36.080]   So maybe spend a few hours hiking around Mount Ham, sorry, biking around Mount Ham.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:41.720]   Then have dinner in Fairfax or there's another cute little town, San Anselmo, and then head
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.240]   home to your little, your cute little hotel in Sausalito.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.320]   If you're in Sausalito, I'll throw out a recommendation for a place called Fish, which
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.440]   is just like a seafood restaurant on the water.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440]   Sweet.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440]   There's your lunch spot.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.520]   It meets the requirement of being Bay Area expensive, but also delicious.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.280]   I love that.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.680]   I don't know if you've been to the Mill Valley Lumber Yard.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.680]   Oh yeah.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.000]   The cutest little complex.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.200]   Someone was like, "Can we meet at this bakery in Mill Valley?"
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.660]   I showed up and I was like, "This is literally like this quintessential cute little shops
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.560]   and a little flower store and a bakery and a little creperie."
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.560]   If you need a place to just relax for an hour and a half or two, I highly recommend that
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.720]   as a stop in Mill Valley.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.440]   I have not spent much time in Marin, but that place was just an awesome spot.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.960]   It's like very unknown, but so cute.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.000]   The bakery is called Flower Craft and it's gluten-free, all gluten-free.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.920]   My wife's got celiac and so it's her favorite place.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.560]   Well, before we wrap, where can people go find all of these great newsletters, all the
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.600]   conversations you're having with people, myself included, which depending on whether this
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.280]   comes out at the same time, we had a great conversation over there.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.300]   The hub of all things I do is lennysnewsletter.com.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.760]   That's where my newsletter is, my podcast.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.840]   It's designed for anyone that's building product, growing product, mostly product managers,
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:07.720]   founders, designers, engineers, anyone basically working on software.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   Lennysnewsletter.com.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.960]   Just check out lennyspodcast.com, the newer thing, but doing super well and I'm really
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   proud of it.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   So check that out.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.480]   And I'm @LennySan on Twitter.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.640]   What's the story behind the San?
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.560]   One of my friends when I was in high school, just called me Lenny San for some unknown
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.400]   reason and I stuck with it.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.280]   I didn't know I was going to be stuck with that username for the rest of my life, but
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   here we are.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   Awesome.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   All right.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   Thank you so much for being here.
