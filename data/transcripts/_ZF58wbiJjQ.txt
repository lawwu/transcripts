[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Shane, a podcast listener, emails in to ask this, "Pastor John, is there any truth about
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.180]   roles in marriage given in Scripture that would encourage the tradition of a wife taking
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.840]   her husband's last name in marriage?
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.040]   Stated in a different way, based on your knowledge of the Bible and its revealed truth about
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.960]   marriage, would you encourage or discourage a woman to keep her last name in marriage?
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   And why or why not?"
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.440]   Okay, let me give you my viewpoint first, my conviction, and then try to put some foundation
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600]   under it.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:44.800]   I would encourage, in our culture especially, a woman to take her husband's last name, and
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.760]   if she wants to give special honor also to her given name, to her family of origin, to
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.720]   make it her legal middle name.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.960]   So that every time she signs her whole legal name, she includes her given name.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.440]   That would be my encouragement to any woman who asks me, or any man or a couple who are
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.040]   pondering what to do in marriage.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040]   And here are my reasons.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.800]   I've got a cultural reason, a practical reason, and a biblical reason.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.120]   Culturally, that's the way it's been done in the West for a long time.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.000]   And to push against it usually signals a resistance to something good, namely that the man, and
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.080]   this is what's good, that the man bears a special burden of responsibility and accountability
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.400]   for leadership and provision and protection in this relationship.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.720]   And I think giving the family that his name signifies that.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.200]   I'm aware that other cultures may handle naming in different ways.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.040]   I don't know enough to pass judgment on those cultures, but I would guess that the custom
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   in the West has its roots in biblical reality, even if it has been forgotten.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.920]   Culture is not absolute, and our culture and others all are in need at various points of
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.320]   change for the sake of God's truth.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.280]   So my guess is it's a good thing and a biblical thing that the West has over time taken on
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.360]   this particular pattern of naming.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240]   That's my cultural argument.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.320]   Second, practically, in our culture it creates difficulties over the long haul for children
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.060]   if the mother and father have different names or a hyphenated name.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.200]   It's culturally confusing to explain, and it makes the naming of the child and the grandchildren
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.280]   unworkable in the long run.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.880]   If Noel and I had taken the name Piper Henry, so her last name was Henry, my last name was
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.680]   Henry, so if we call our children Carsten Piper Henry and Benjamin Piper Henry and Abraham
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.880]   Piper Henry and Barnabas Piper Henry and Talith Piper Henry, and all of them were Piper Henrys,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.560]   what happens when they marry?
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.840]   And suppose they marry, let's just say one of the boys marries a woman whose last name
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.880]   is Smith Jones, and they want hyphenated names.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.080]   So now would it be John, suppose they named their first child after me, John Piper Henry
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.480]   Smith Jones?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.320]   Well, sooner or later that just becomes unworkable, and you have to make choices somehow.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.080]   So it's just not very practical to try to go another route than the traditional one.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.640]   But neither of those arguments is compelling apart from something more substantial.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.600]   And so here's my word from Scripture.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.960]   I think generally the Bible calls the husband to be, if he's physically able, the one who
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.760]   bears the special responsibility for leadership, provision, and protection.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.320]   And each one of those words is chosen very carefully, and I've written a whole book on
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.560]   what I mean by every one of them.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.480]   Special responsibility, the book is called "What's the Difference?"
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.160]   Special responsibility for leadership, provision, and protection.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.920]   And I based this on Ephesians 5, "Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord, for the husband
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.840]   is the head," so that's where I get leadership and initiative from, "of the wife as Christ
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.080]   is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior."
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.240]   So the husband is not a Christ in the full sense, but he's a Christ in a mini-sense for
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.640]   his wife in that he saves her from any danger that is encroaching upon her.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.120]   He feels a special responsibility, "I protect this family," like Jesus has protected his
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.720]   church.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.420]   And then it goes on, "Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.240]   everything to their husbands.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.680]   Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.640]   So now we know this responsibility for leadership and provision is costly.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.000]   Many men have lost their lives to protect their wives, to provide for their wives, and
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.720]   they should.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.840]   Husbands should love their wives, Paul says, as their own bodies, and then he comes to
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.380]   this third piece, "He who loves his wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh,
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.720]   but nourishes it and cherishes it."
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.400]   So now we have the third piece of provision and nourishing.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.480]   So leadership and protection and provision in Ephesians 5.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.760]   So husbands are to be like Christ in leading, rescuing from danger, nourishing with what
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.580]   the church needs and what their wives need.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.500]   And this is not thought of as a right or a privilege, it's thought of as a responsibility
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.400]   and a burden, a very costly burden.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Many men have lost their lives fulfilling this role.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.760]   It's especially appointed because God has this man there as an agent of his own care
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:06.000]   and provision and authority for his family, and the name over that family is very suitably
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.300]   the leader's name.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.880]   That just makes so much sense if you buy the biblical vision of manhood and womanhood.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.360]   One more thing, there is, I believe, a more specific illustration of how that works out
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.840]   in Genesis 5, 1 to 3, where it says this, "This is the book of the generations of Adam.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   When God created man, Adam," same word, man and Adam are the same, "he made him in the
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.460]   likeness of God.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:48.860]   Male and female, he created them, and he blessed them and named them Adam, named them man."
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.980]   Some people translate it man, and they will say, "So it really doesn't mean that he gave
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.780]   them the man's name."
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.440]   But think about it.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:06.220]   He gave them the generic name man, just like he gave the whole race the generic name man,
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.780]   and there is another word for woman.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.420]   Verse 3, "When Adam," now this is why I think the personal name is meant in verse 2, so
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.780]   I'm going to read verse 2 and 3 together again.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:25.860]   "Male and female, he created them, he blessed them and named them Adam when they were created,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.500]   when Adam had lived 130 years."
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.460]   So he's not talking about man in general here, he's talking about the specific Adam that
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.300]   he had in mind in verse 2.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.820]   "He fathered a son in his own likeness after his own image," and so on.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:45.800]   So the generic name for the man and the woman was man, or Adam.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.220]   The generic name was not woman.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.540]   Could have been, but God didn't do it that way.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:57.860]   And then God called the first man, man, to distinguish him from the other men, and so
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.780]   he's called Adam over against Noah, say.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:07.780]   So it seems to me that God gave us this pointer toward the naming of our families.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.100]   Both man and woman are created in the image of God, but the man bears a special responsibility
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:20.460]   before God for this union, and that's signified with putting his name on the banner that flies
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.460]   over the family.
