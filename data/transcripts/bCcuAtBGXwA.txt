[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   The sixteenth verse in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, "And
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.600]   that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.760]   thereby."
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.840]   This is one of the phrases in this tremendous statement, this mighty argument that the apostle
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840]   is developing.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.200]   It is difficult to know where to start reading the context.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.280]   Perhaps we will start reading at verse fourteen.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.960]   "For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.500]   of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:00.120]   contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.280]   that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.280]   thereby."
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.800]   It is one, I say, of the links in a great chain.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.880]   And therefore, to understand as we should the meaning of the particular link, we must
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.920]   again remind ourselves of the chain.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.480]   That is a great principle, incidentally, with regard to the whole of Scripture.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.820]   The part can only be understood truly in the context of the whole.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.920]   Now the general argument, therefore, is this.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.400]   The apostle is anxious that these Ephesians should realize what an astounding and marvellous
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.260]   thing it is that they are members of the Christian Church, and particularly that they are members
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.920]   in the Christian Church side by side with the Jews.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.840]   Because if there was one thing that appeared to be more impossible than anything else in
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.640]   the ancient world, it was that there should ever be any reconciliation between Jews and
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920]   Gentiles.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.720]   The world was divided.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.440]   But the apostle says that in God's marvellous plan of salvation in Christ Jesus, the impossible
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.360]   has happened.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.620]   The gospel is always producing the impossible.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.560]   But he takes it in this way.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.000]   There were certain things that had to happen before those Ephesians could possibly thus
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.680]   become fellow heirs and fellow members with the Jews.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.720]   The first thing was their sinful condition must be dealt with.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.520]   He has shown us how that was dealt with in verses 1 to 10.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.840]   Now then he comes to the second problem, this matter of bringing the Gentiles and the Jews
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.080]   together.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.840]   And here he tells us there is, as it were, a dual problem.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.080]   They need first of all to be brought together, but then they both together need to be brought
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.600]   to God.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.640]   Because you remember that his initial statement was this, that at that time, "Ye were without
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.960]   Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.980]   of promise," that's their separation from the Jews, "having no hope, and without God
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.860]   in the world," that's their separation from God.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.980]   And both these things are necessary.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.000]   And what the apostle is showing in this immediate context that we are dealing with is how that
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.320]   has been done, how both things have been done in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:56.720]   So that the fundamental postulate of the whole statement is this, "He is our peace."
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.160]   That's the fundamental proposition.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.640]   The Lord Jesus Christ himself is our peace in every respect.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.160]   Now then the apostle first takes up the question as to how Christ is our peace and has made
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.500]   peace actually between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.960]   And you remember we saw that he had done two things.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.400]   Negatively, he had broken down the middle wall of partition.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.840]   He has abolished that law of commandments in ordinances, and thereby has got rid of
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   that enmity.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.980]   That was the negative part.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.120]   But last Sunday morning we saw that it was positive also.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.960]   He did not merely remove the middle wall of partition.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   That isn't true unity.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.400]   True unity consists of making peace.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.000]   So he has done that also.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.640]   He has created in himself of Twain one new man, so making peace.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.880]   There is this new humanity, the body of Christ, the Christian Church.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.680]   Call it what you will.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   And the unity between the Jew and the Gentile is something absolutely new, something that
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.480]   has been brought into being that was not there before.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.280]   It's a new creation.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.760]   The old has passed away.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.120]   All things have become new.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.640]   One new man in Christ.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.160]   Very well, there's the first problem.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   But still, says the apostle, there is this other problem.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.680]   The Ephesians, these pagans as they were, these Gentiles, were not only separated from
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.360]   the Jews, the commonwealth of Israel, they were also separated from God.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.160]   And obviously there can be no true unity as between men and men until there is this other
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.860]   unity because the original division into Jew and Gentile was all in terms of God.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:13.320]   So the apostle now goes on to show how this second matter has also been dealt with, and
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:22.660]   has been dealt with again in the same way by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.000]   But you notice at once that the apostle puts this in a very interesting manner.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.760]   Instead of simply telling us how the Ephesians, who were pagans, have been reconciled unto
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:42.160]   God, he says, and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.760]   slain the enmity thereby.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.320]   Both Jews and Gentiles.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.680]   And then he shows us exactly how this has taken place.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.400]   Now the teaching here of course is absolutely fundamental and vital, and especially in this
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:08.280]   whole question of unity, and in respect of this whole matter of peace.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.040]   If you like it in its general form, we can put it like this.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:23.800]   All the minor and secondary divisions and separations and quarrelings among men are
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.240]   ultimately due to the fact that they are all together separated from God.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.960]   Now that is, I say, a fundamental and a universal proposition.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.400]   The world is full of divisions and distinctions.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   We are all aware of that.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:48.280]   Countries, nations, blocks, groups, curtains one side, the other side, in the nation, classes,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.520]   industrial groups, capital, labour, master and employer and servant, and so on.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:00.080]   And within all these groups again, divisions, rivalries, envies, the world is full of divisions
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.640]   and separations.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   Yes, but here is the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:15.920]   All these minor, secondary, third-rate, fifth-rate, tenth-rate divisions and separations and quarrelings
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:25.280]   are all of them due to one thing only, and that is that all men are separated from God
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.840]   and are in the wrong relationship to him.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.400]   Now that is the whole case of the Bible.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.840]   There would be no trouble in life at all were it not that men had rebelled against God and
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   had fallen from God.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.940]   All the troubles are due to that.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:50.280]   So that conversely we are entitled to say this, "Unity therefore among men is only
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:59.120]   possible as men are reconciled together to God."
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.720]   Now you see the importance of that statement.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.160]   There are people who talk liberally about the application of Christian teaching to the
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   problems.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   It is quite simple, they say.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.960]   You have simply got to put it before people and tell them to do it, and well, there it
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   is.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:23.200]   According to this teaching it is impossible until men and women are reconciled to God.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.160]   It is a sheer waste of breath and of energy and of time to try to get Christian behavior
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.880]   from people who are not Christians.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.960]   They cannot do it.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:41.120]   Man has to be right with God before he can be right with his fellow men and women.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.880]   I remind you again of how our Lord answered the question that was put to him when he was
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   asked which is the first and the greatest commandment.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.400]   His reply was, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.520]   and all thy mind and all thy strength, and then"—the second is like unto it—"thou
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.240]   shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.800]   But you cannot do the second until you have done the first.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.760]   So that you see, this is, as I say, a basic foundational principle.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.560]   And it is because this is being forgotten that one sometimes is tempted to say that
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.000]   the whole trouble in the world today is that preachers are talking politics and politicians
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.200]   are preaching.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:36.440]   And it is because both parties do not understand the gospel.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.720]   Now then, let's see how the apostle works this out.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.480]   In a sense he is going on, I say, to a new theme.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.280]   In another sense he is continuing the old one.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.640]   The fact is the two themes cannot be separated.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.400]   That is why he connects them with this word "and," which really means here "in addition."
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.240]   Now then, what is he saying?
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   Well, the best way perhaps to approach this is to look at this great word "reconcile."
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:14.080]   And that he might reconcile both unto God.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.680]   It is a very interesting word, this, the word that the apostle actually used and which is
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   translated "reconcile."
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.120]   It is only found in one other place in the whole Bible, and it is the place which we
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   found in the reading just now in the epistle to the Colossians, the first chapter, verses
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.920]   20 and 21.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.320]   He there uses the identical word, but nowhere else.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.200]   Now you will find in our English Bibles the word "reconcile."
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.040]   In other places you will find it in Romans 5, in the tenth verse.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.960]   You will find it in 2 Corinthians 5, verses 18, 19, and 20.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.240]   But in all those cases, the word actually used by the apostle was not the same word
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.440]   as is used here.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.600]   It is the same root.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.500]   In a sense, it is the same essential meaning.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.560]   But here he used a very special word.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.760]   He put a prefix onto the word which he uses in the other places.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.400]   And therefore, in expanding this, we must take the word as he used it, prefix as well.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.280]   What therefore does the word "reconcile" mean?
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:27.720]   Well, let me suggest to you that it includes the following ideas and conceptions.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:35.880]   It means, first of all, a change from a hostile to a friendly relationship.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.760]   That is the simplest meaning.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.560]   That is the basic meaning, a change from a hostile to a friendly relationship.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.320]   But it means more.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:54.480]   It does not merely mean, in the second place, a friendship after an estrangement.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:06.620]   But it means really bringing together again to reunite and to reconnect.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:12.080]   In other words, it does not merely do away with the estrangement.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.000]   It is not merely that it brings people into speaking terms again who formerly passed one
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.120]   another without even looking at one another.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.120]   It is not merely doing away with the estrangement.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:27.880]   It is a real bringing together again, a reuniting, a reconnecting.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.940]   It carries that meaning.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:36.800]   It is a word also that emphasizes the completeness of the action.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:48.320]   It is not merely a return to favor with one, but it means that the enmity is so laid aside
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.080]   completely that complete amity follows.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.640]   It is not merely the abolition of the enmity.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.480]   It is the restoration of a complete amity.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.340]   And the emphasis here, I say, is on the completeness of the action.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.340]   It is not patching up a disagreement.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.340]   It is not a compromise.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.340]   You know, the conference has gone on for days and there has been a deadlock.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.540]   Somebody then gets a bright idea.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.940]   What about introducing this word?
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.060]   Ah, you can just patch it up.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.100]   Then you know there will be another strike in a few months.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.100]   It is not that.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.100]   No, no.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   It is a complete action.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:32.320]   It is a complete amity and concord where there was formerly hostility.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.100]   But it also means this in the fourth place.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.140]   It is not merely that the two partners to the trouble or the dispute or the quarrel
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.220]   have both decided to come together.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:52.580]   This word that the apostle used implies that it is one of the parties that takes the action
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.940]   and it is the upper one that does it.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.340]   There is a part of this word which means an action from above.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.500]   It is the Greek word kata.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.260]   It suggests this action that comes down from above.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.420]   It is not the two sides coming together as it were voluntarily.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:16.100]   It is one bringing the other into this position of complete amity and concord.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:24.060]   And finally, in the fifth place, the word carries the meaning that it is a restoration
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.660]   of something that was there before.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:34.660]   Now our word reconcile which is a sort of transliteration of the Latin word in and of
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.500]   itself suggests that, doesn't it?
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.340]   The word is re-concile.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.940]   They were conciled before.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.960]   They are now re-conciled, brought back to where they were.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.960]   It was all right.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   It went wrong.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   It is brought back again.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.220]   Now the word carries all those meanings.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:16:02.380]   And it is this last point especially that is introduced by the special prefix that is
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:08.660]   in the word that the apostle used here, the apple, the prefix, bringing back again the
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.520]   re.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.020]   That is the thing that is emphasized here.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.780]   Very well then, what is the apostle's teaching?
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.080]   Well, let me try to put it to you in a number of principles.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:32.580]   The first thing obviously that we are taught here is that sin separates from God.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.980]   All our troubles are ultimately due to the fact that we are not clear about sin.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.580]   The apostle has already said it in verse 12.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.780]   He repeats it here.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.840]   It can never be repeated too often.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:49.660]   That at that time he was without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:56.200]   from the covenants of promise, having no hope without God in the world, and then the opposite
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.420]   is being made nigh, being drawn nigh.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.500]   All this is the terrible thing about sin.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:10.300]   But I suggest that we all are prone to forget this element in sin.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.040]   Sin is not mere transgression of the law.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.860]   It is that.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.460]   Sin is not only disobedience.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.460]   It is that.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.900]   Sin is not only missing the mark.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.380]   It is that.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:28.860]   But the most appalling thing about sin, the devastating thing about sin, is that it means
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.300]   breaking fellowship.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:39.700]   It means that we are cut off from God, that we are out of relationship to God, that we
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.220]   are without God.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:48.100]   Now, that is the thing that the apostle is here emphasizing.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.180]   But you see, it does not even stop at that.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:57.580]   Sin is that which produces enmity between man and God.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:04.020]   And that, according to this teaching everywhere, is the condition of man in sin.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.380]   You see, it happened at the beginning.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:14.180]   God made man for himself, and man was in fellowship with God.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.740]   Oh, that we held on to that idea as we ought.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.900]   We were made for God.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.600]   We were meant for God.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.700]   We were never made for the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.620]   Man was made for God.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.540]   He was meant for fellowship with God.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.540]   He was meant to enjoy God.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.020]   And he was like that.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.940]   But alas, sin came in.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.340]   And you see, the terrible thing about sin was not simply that they ate of the forbidden
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   fruit.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.540]   That was true, that was an action, that was rebellion, that was arrogance, that was breaking
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.740]   God's commandment and ignoring his law.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.820]   I know.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:58.460]   But the terrible thing was that it broke fellowship.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:06.140]   Man was walking with God, and suddenly he turns his back on him.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.420]   That's the awful thing I say about sin.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.500]   And therefore that is the problem.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.920]   That is the thing that needs to be put right.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.380]   It isn't just a question of our being forgiven for the particular actions.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.820]   That isn't the problem only.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.340]   The problem is, how can this fellowship be restored?
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.660]   How can it be brought back again?
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.780]   You see, that is where so many go wrong in their thinking about these matters.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.420]   That's why they don't understand the meaning of the death of Christ and the cross, and
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.260]   see no meaning in a communion service.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.940]   They say, "Surely there's no great problem.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.020]   When a child does something wrong, the parent forgives him and all is well."
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.740]   Well, isn't it like that with God?
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.020]   If I confess my sins, if I say I'm sorry, won't God just forgive me?
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.980]   And the answer of the New Testament is, it's not as simple as that.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.100]   If it were as simple as that, the Lord Jesus Christ would never have come into the world.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.780]   He certainly would never have gone to the cross.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.540]   No, the problem is a problem of fellowship.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.940]   How can fellowship be restored?
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:17.460]   And this is not only of importance in the initial coming into the Christian life.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:23.740]   There is nothing that is more vitally important for all of us who are Christians.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.240]   And the sooner the better, my friends.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:32.460]   We begin to think of sins not in terms of actions which are bad, but in terms of our
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.640]   relationship to God, the better Christians we will be.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.680]   Now all this is set out very perfectly for us in the first epistle of John and in his
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.000]   first chapter.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.760]   There you've got a picture.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.280]   The Christian is a man who is in fellowship with God, and he is walking with God.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.920]   Our fellowship is truly with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ, says John.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.680]   And he says, "We the apostles are in this fellowship, and we want you to be enjoying
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.960]   it also."
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.440]   But then the question arises, how is this possible?
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.040]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.800]   And I am sinful and I keep on falling into sin.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.640]   And the moment I fall into sin, what happens?
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.680]   Well I break my fellowship with God.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.640]   It isn't only that that action is wrong.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.440]   I am insulting my companion.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.680]   I am doing something in the presence of the holy God who is light that is to him hateful
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.300]   and abhorrent.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.440]   How can we walk in fellowship?
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:38.300]   That's how John puts it.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:45.820]   And I am emphasizing it for this good reason, that in my personal experience and in my experience
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:52.400]   as a pastor, there is no important discovery that the Christian can make in his battle
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.440]   with sin, with particular sins, than just this very thing.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.000]   And what I tell people always is this, look here, I say stop praying about that particular
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.360]   thing that gets you down.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.920]   Make your praying positive.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.040]   Think of it in terms of your fellowship with God.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.280]   Don't think of it merely in terms of you are going down and that particular thing.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   Turn your back on it if you like.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.800]   Begin to think of yourself as a companion of God and of Christ and say, "No, I am with
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.600]   him and I must do nothing in his presence that he'll dislike and that will hurt him."
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   Think positively.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.920]   Remind yourself that Christ is always with you and then you'll begin to hate the thing
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.840]   and it will become unthinkable.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.200]   But that's what we tend to fail to do, isn't it?
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   We forget that the terrible thing about sin is that it is a violation of fellowship, that
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.920]   it separates us from God.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.040]   Very well, the term reconciliation at once brings us face to face with that.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.560]   We've been out of fellowship, we need to be restored to fellowship.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:09.800]   Now God in the call of Abraham and in the forming of the nation of Israel was already
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:16.020]   taking this great move to bring that reconciliation to pass.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.160]   What God did was this.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   You see, the whole world had sinned in Adam and had fallen away from God, so we are all
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.320]   by nature estranged from God.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.840]   Very well, now then, man does nothing and can do nothing about that, but God does something
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.760]   and what he did was this.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:39.640]   Out of all the mass of mankind he forms a new nation for himself, a people for his own
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.080]   peculiar position, a people with whom he can have fellowship and they can have fellowship
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   with him, a new nation, a new creation.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.040]   That's the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.240]   All the rest were outside that.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.920]   They were still not in fellowship with him.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.480]   These were in fellowship, the rest were not.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.360]   Now if we don't grasp that there is a sense in which we don't understand the Old Testament
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.640]   at all.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:14.520]   That is the Old Testament, the story of God's forming this peculiar people for himself and
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.120]   the relationships between them.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.880]   But unfortunately that was not sufficient, for the apostle tells us here that the Jews
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.680]   as well as the Gentiles need to be reconciled to God.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.520]   It isn't only the Ephesians who needed the reconciliation, the Jews did.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   Why?
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.640]   Well, here is the answer of the New Testament.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:49.720]   All the Levitical sacrifices, the burnt offerings and the sacrifices, the killing of the Paschal
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.320]   lamb and the daily lamb and the presentation of the blood and all the rest of it, all this
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:03.280]   rich and elaborate ceremonial was rarely not sufficient.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.240]   It was merely a shadow of something that was to come.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.840]   It was merely a covering over of the sins of men.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   It really didn't.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.960]   The blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer really cannot cleanse the soul.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.240]   It covered over the sin, but it didn't really deal with the problem.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.040]   It was sufficient for the time being.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.780]   But according to this same apostle Paul in the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:40.980]   it was necessary that God should justify all that, and he did justify it on the cross of
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.980]   Calvary.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:50.740]   He had to cover himself for the remission of sins that were past, and here he does it.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:57.820]   But not only was that a problem, the Jews, nonetheless, needed to be reconciled for this
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:06.340]   reason that they had so completely misunderstood what God had done in Abram and in the nation
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.580]   that they thought that the mere fact that they were physical descendants from Abram
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.260]   in and of itself saved them.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:18.260]   You remember John the Baptist knew that because when he began to preach to those Jews he said,
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:24.660]   "Begin not to say amongst yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father,' for I say unto
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:30.540]   you that God can even of these stones raise up children unto Abraham."
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.580]   But that is what they were saying.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.740]   On one occasion the Lord Jesus Christ said unto them, "If ye continue in my words, then
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:45.260]   are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall receive the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:51.300]   And they resented it, saying, "We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.100]   Thou sayest, 'Ye shall be made free.'"
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.900]   The Jews had misunderstood it all.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.260]   They said, "Because we are Jews, we are right with God," and thereby brought condemnation
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.300]   on themselves.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.620]   They needed to be reconciled.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:15.540]   And furthermore, as we have seen on a previous Sunday, their attitude to the Gentiles was
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.860]   terribly sinful.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:23.900]   They regarded them as dogs, they despised them, they were outsiders to them, and therefore
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:30.140]   they were deeply in sin, and for these various reasons they needed to be reconciled to God.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:35.660]   Very well, that brings us to our next proposition, which is this.
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:47.700]   The apostle teaches here that they are both reconciled to God in exactly the same way,
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:57.060]   not separately, and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.060]   That is the point.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.780]   That is his emphasis here.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:05.020]   Now the one body does not mean the physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.700]   That is covered by the cross.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.860]   What he means here is this, the one body is the Church, as we saw last Sunday.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:20.220]   So what he teaches is that the Jew and the Gentile are reconciled to God in exactly the
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.220]   same way.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:27.340]   There is no longer any difference between the Jew and the Gentile.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:32.220]   There is only one way of being reconciled to God.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:42.340]   There is one God and one mediator only between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.580]   There are no separate ways into the kingdom of God for Jew and Gentile.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:53.180]   There is only one way, and this is it, the one body again.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:59.660]   I am emphasizing it, you know, for this reason, that there is a teaching which seems to be
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.500]   quite popular, but which seems to me, in the light of this verse and others, to be so terribly
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:12.700]   dangerously unscriptural, which says this, that now during this dispensation it is in
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:18.820]   Christ and by his grace and by his death that men are saved, but that in a future time the
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.660]   Jews will then be saved by the keeping of the law.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.260]   To them will be preached not the gospel of the grace of God, but the gospel of the kingdom
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:34.780]   and the law, and they will keep the law and they will enter into the kingdom by the keeping
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.140]   of the law.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:45.380]   I say again quite deliberately that that is a denial of the fact that there is only one
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:54.260]   way to be reconciled with God, and that that is through Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:01.860]   There is no access into the presence of God except through the one and only mediator,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:07.940]   that he might reconcile both in one body.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:14.620]   And it is the only body, the only way.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:23.780]   It is in this one body, the church, and no man ever has or ever will be reconciled to
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.260]   God save in this way.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.940]   Abraham and the Old Testament saints, all whose sins had been covered, they are really
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.100]   reconciled in Christ.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.300]   All in all future ages will be reconciled in the same way.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:46.700]   It is by the grace of God and that alone that any man can be saved.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:52.500]   So I go on to the next proposition which I put in this form.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:31:04.060]   The reconciliation is achieved and produced by the Lord Jesus Christ, and that he, the
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:13.580]   Lord Jesus, might reconcile both unto God in one body, he.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:20.780]   Oh, that we might be all clear about this.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.140]   There is no hope for men apart from him.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:31.380]   He came into the world because it was the only way.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.820]   No man, I say again, ever can and ever or ever will save himself by his own efforts
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.180]   or striving.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.340]   Whatever is preached to him, the law had been given it had failed.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.700]   No man can ever keep this law.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.380]   Christ had to come.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:57.100]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, and there is no other way.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.980]   Here the apostle puts the emphasis upon the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:07.260]   It was God who sent him, but it is he by coming and by all his passive and active obedience
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.500]   who has done it.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:16.780]   He is our peace, and he alone is our peace.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.740]   I say again that unless we ascribe all the praise and the honour and the glory to the
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:27.540]   Lord Jesus Christ, we are not Christians.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.740]   It is his action.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.540]   It is God's action.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.100]   Man is dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.500]   He is an enemy and alien in his mind by wicked works.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   He is a God-hater.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.900]   That is man.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.900]   He does nothing.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.740]   How is reconciliation possible?
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.980]   I told you in the definition of the word, it is an action from above.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.100]   It is a move on God's part.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:53.180]   It is the God whom we have ignored and rebelled against and on whom we have turned our backs.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.540]   It is he who initiates the great movement.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.180]   He began it in the old.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.180]   He continues it.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.740]   It is perfect in Christ.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.100]   It is his action.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.860]   It is all in Jesus Christ.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   It is all the grace of God in Christ.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:22.740]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.740]   That is the message.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:31.900]   Ah yes, but in particular you notice he says it is by the cross, and that he might reconcile
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:39.860]   both unto God in one body, by the cross.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.100]   I would again call your attention to the way in which the apostle keeps on repeating these
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.980]   things.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:53.300]   But now in Christ Jesus he has said in verse 13, "Ye who sometimes were far off are made
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.420]   nigh by the blood of Christ."
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:05.500]   He does not stop here at saying that he might reconcile both unto God in one body in himself.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.420]   No, no.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   By the cross he brings it in because he must bring it in.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.700]   There is no reconciliation apart from the cross.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.300]   And what does the cross mean?
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:28.100]   Well, that parallel passage that I read to you out of Colossians 1 puts it very perfectly.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:34.700]   "Having made peace by the blood of his cross."
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.700]   It is the death.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.940]   It is the blood shedding.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.900]   That is how God makes peace.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.020]   That is how Christ makes peace.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.540]   That is how reconciliation comes about.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.980]   There is no possibility of reconciliation apart from the death of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.380]   upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.380]   Why?
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.820]   That is the last point.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:07.180]   Having slain the enmity thereby, therein, by that.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.680]   But here we come to the questions people are so fond of asking.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.100]   Why was this essential?
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.860]   How does the death of Christ upon the cross reconcile us?
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.700]   Well, you will find that strange answers are given to that which seem to me to be quite
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.700]   incapable of being reconciled with this statement.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:37.740]   Some people say that what happens is this, that God forgives the cross, that cruel men
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:43.860]   put our Lord to death, but that God forgives them even for doing that.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.860]   That we were all there.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.180]   Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.300]   Yes, you were.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.140]   You were in one or the other, the soldier, the Pharisee, or one of them.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.140]   You crucified him.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.860]   Ah, but this is the message.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.860]   God even forgives that.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:01.020]   That is not making peace by the cross.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:05.140]   That is making peace in spite of the cross, which is the exact opposite.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:10.260]   But what the apostle teaches everywhere is this, that God, Christ, makes peace by the
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:15.820]   cross, through, by means of the cross.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.460]   Or another way in which it is put, and some of you may have heard it, even on the wireless
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:29.420]   this last week, this they say is the message, God always produces good even out of evil.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.020]   Joseph of course said it.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.820]   Joseph said to his brothers, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.060]   You sold me in a wrong principle and in a wrong way.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.060]   You meant something wrong."
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.100]   Ah, yes, but God turned the evil into good, and he always does.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.820]   And the supreme illustration of that is that God even turned the evil of the cross into
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.820]   good.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.820]   Men took the action.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.420]   God turned it into something marvellous.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.300]   Is that saving us and reconciling us?
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.540]   By the cross.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:06.180]   No, I say it again, just as a way of saying that he saves us in spite of it.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.740]   That isn't saving by the blood of the cross.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:17.020]   He is not making peace there by, through, by means of the blood of the cross.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:25.100]   Well then I wonder whether it means this, that as I look at Christ there dying innocently
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:33.780]   on the cross, my heart shall be broken as I realise the sinfulness and the enormity
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.300]   of it all.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.980]   No, because that again is not making peace by the blood of the cross.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.980]   According to Paul it has happened, it has been done.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.740]   It isn't something that only happens when I realise what happens on the cross.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.660]   It was done once and forever.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.140]   The action was completed on Calvary.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.820]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.260]   He has done it once and forever.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:07.140]   No, no, it is something much more profound than this.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:13.940]   The teaching is that before reconciliation is possible, something has to happen on God's
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.500]   side as well as on our side.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.580]   Sin has brought enmity between man and God.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.060]   God hates sin.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:30.500]   God's wrath is manifested against sin.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:37.100]   And before there can be reconciliation, before God can again bless man, this enmity has got
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.020]   to be removed.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.580]   And the teaching is that it was removed.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.580]   How?
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.900]   By the blood of the cross.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   How?
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   Well, doesn't it put it like this?
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.380]   Why does he mention the blood?
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.380]   Why the cross?
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.380]   Why the death?
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.580]   That is an explanation of all the Old Testament teaching.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.620]   You remember how it was done there?
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.360]   And that was God's own method?
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.420]   It was God who ordained all that as a picture of that which was going to be done in Christ.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.000]   Isn't this how they did it?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.580]   They took the animal.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.380]   The animal was brought forward.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.620]   Then they put their hands on the head of the animal.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.620]   What did that mean?
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.820]   They were taking their sins and the sins of the people and transferring them unto the
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.980]   animal.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:25.740]   And then the animal was killed, his blood was shed, and the blood was presented as an
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.740]   offering.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.140]   And the animal was offered as a sacrifice.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.300]   That's the teaching.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:39.260]   And that is precisely the New Testament teaching about the death of Christ on the cross.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:45.420]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.620]   them.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.660]   Why not?
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.300]   Because he imputed their trespasses unto him.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:56.380]   God took your sins and mine and he put them on the head of Christ and then as the Lamb
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:01.060]   of God he slew him.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.540]   Not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:12.220]   Because he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.980]   righteousness of God in him by the blood of his cross.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.420]   By the cross he did it.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:23.980]   The enmity, man's enmity against God was put unto Christ and there was taken away.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.180]   He slew it there.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.580]   That's the teaching.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:41.740]   It was because Christ's blood as the Lamb of God was shed on Calvary's hill that the
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.540]   way of reconciliation is open.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:54.500]   The enmity has been removed and God can look on men with benignity and is again ready to
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.820]   bless him and to receive him and to restore him.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.300]   The Jews needed that.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.020]   The Gentiles needed it.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.900]   And together in Christ they have received it.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:14.140]   In Christ by his blood they can enter together into the holiest of all.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.620]   Oh, what a wonderful gospel.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.520]   What an amazing statement.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.100]   What happened on Calvary?
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.060]   Christ was slain.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:31.620]   Yes, but by being slain he slew the enmity.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.540]   He was slain.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.740]   He slew the enmity.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.180]   He made an open show of principalities and powers.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.700]   He nailed the law to the cross.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:54.500]   And man is reconciled to God.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:00.980]   And all are reconciled in the same way, in Christ.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:06.180]   Whether you are Jew, whether you are Gentile, barbarian, Assyrian, bond, or free, male or
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:13.740]   female, good or bad, high or low, you have got to come this way.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.060]   He died for the church.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:22.260]   Or as the Apostle Paul puts it in his great farewell address to the elders of the church
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:31.860]   at Ephesus, "The church which he has purchased with his own blood."
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:44.620]   One body, the only way to reconcile God and men, and men and God, by the cross, by his
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:55.300]   death, which slays the enmity, which takes away all sins, the blood of Jesus Christ his
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:03.180]   Son cleanseth us from all sin and unrighteousness.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.660]   Amen.
