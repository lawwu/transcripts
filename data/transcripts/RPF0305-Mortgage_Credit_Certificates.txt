[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:39.080]   You know that old debate that comes into play when we talk about the value of mortgages,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.280]   the whole thing of, "Well, if you have interest on a mortgage, it's not fully deductible.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.280]   It's just a deduction.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680]   It's not a credit."
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680]   You know that argument?
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.680]   Well, let's add some fuel to the fire today by busting that one just a little bit.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.320]   Can't do it completely.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.240]   But today, let's talk about how you can actually get a full tax credit for some of your mortgage
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:20.160]   interest.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.040]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.100]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.040]   Today we talk about mortgage credit certificates.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.320]   You know, I recently sold my house and this was one of the ones that really frustrated
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   me.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.720]   It frustrated me that I never found out about this one.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.920]   It cost me a couple thousand bucks a year.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.000]   So if you own a house, prepare to be frustrated.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.600]   But if you don't own a house, pay attention to today's show and I may be able to save
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.080]   you a couple thousand bucks a year.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.320]   So glad that you are here with me on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.120]   I try to keep the show interesting and engaging on a daily basis.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.360]   So I try very hard to – well, I try to keep the content varied.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.440]   And I've slacked a little bit on the technical content in the past few weeks.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.160]   You'll have to forgive me for that.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.080]   It's just I haven't been able to get it done.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   It's coming back.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.340]   Today we're going to dip our toes into the technical content by talking about mortgage
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.600]   credit certificates.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.840]   Now if you're one of those who gets intimidated by the discussion of technical financial planning
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.640]   content, don't worry.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.560]   The way I'm going to do this show is first I'm going to lay out for you the benefit
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.000]   of what a mortgage credit certificate is.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.880]   Basically it's a straight tax – I can do this in two sentences.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.440]   A mortgage credit certificate is a straight tax credit where a certain amount of your
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.760]   mortgage interest up to 2,000 bucks is directly, directly reducing your income tax liability.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.960]   So what you can do is instead of sending the US federal government $2,000, up to $2,000,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   you can just simply send that to your mortgage company in interest.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.360]   That's why I led with my little teaser talking about how this is actually a direct mortgage
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   credit.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   It's not a deduction.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's not subject to whatever your current tax rate is.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.400]   It's an actual mortgage credit.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.280]   And it's one of the coolest programs that I never found out about before buying a house.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.760]   So I'm going to give you – what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you up front
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   the big picture of what it is like I just did.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.120]   I'm going to tell you in today's show some of the major details and then for those
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   of you who are very detail-oriented, I'll give you some of the little specifics and
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.600]   restrictions that you might need to know.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.120]   So that's the course of today's show.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.800]   So I always try to give a little bit of financial value in my show and today it could be $2,000
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.720]   of savings on your taxes, which to give you some incentive and some reason to do that,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.840]   let's do some quick math.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.400]   I always like to make things relevant.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   And here's what I want you to know.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.440]   When you're paying attention – so key tip number one, when you take a monthly number
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.520]   or an annual number of savings, always take that and immediately convert it into your
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:05.200]   head of how much money you would be able to avoid saving if you were able to reduce that
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   expense.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.080]   So what I'm going to do is since I'm going to save you up to $2,000 today of tax savings,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   let's multiply 2,000 times 25.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.720]   This is a little inverse trick of the 4% rule.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.440]   So we take any kind of annual expenditure, we multiply it by 25 and that's how much
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.000]   money we would need in financial independence to cover that income.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.880]   So $2,000 times 25 equals $50,000.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.840]   And so with that $50,000, I'm going to save you – you don't have to save – I'm
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.440]   going to save it to you in that you don't have to save the money to be financially independent.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.400]   So real financial value here.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.600]   Before I get to all the details to explain how this works and how you can apply this
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.760]   to your life, I want to take care of sponsors.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.160]   Two sponsors today.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.560]   Number one is Paladin Registry.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.240]   Paladin Registry is my solution that I went out and found for you guys when you were asking
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.360]   me, "Joshua, how do you find a great financial advisor?"
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.880]   It's tough to find a great financial advisor.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.320]   The show I almost did today was my advice to a new widow or to a widow about how to
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.040]   find a good financial advisor.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   I had this in a personal phone call with a family member of mine who their husband had
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.280]   passed away several years ago and they called me up and were asking me, "How do I find
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   a good financial advisor?"
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.920]   Well, I'll do that show maybe tomorrow.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   Who knows?
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.560]   But I'll do that show for you, some of the tips that I gave her about how to actually
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.040]   work with a financial advisor.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.000]   But what you should know is that to this family member, I specifically said you need to start
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.920]   at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.520]   So that's – when I do these ads and whatnot, I'm serious.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.800]   This is the best place to start.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.200]   Now, just because you go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin doesn't mean that you're automatically
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.080]   going to find somebody that's outstanding.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.760]   I hope you do, but it's not necessarily automatic.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.360]   But there's going to be a much higher likelihood that you're going to be able to find a great
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.800]   financial advisor by using this referral service.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.520]   It's a registry of financial advisors who have been carefully vetted.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.000]   Their background has been considered.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   They've been searched into.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Their due diligence, their credentials have been checked.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   They're legitimate advisors.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.480]   Now, it's up to you to find the right personality fit.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.040]   It's up to you to find the advisor who speaks your language.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.320]   But if you're looking for a good financial advisor, start your search at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.440]   If you type that in a web browser, what it will do is it will flip you forward to a landing
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.140]   page where you put in your name, your address, your information, and that will pass it through
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.560]   to Paladin and they will put some advisors in contact with you.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.800]   So RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.340]   Very quickly, sponsor day number two today is Trade King.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.800]   Trade King is the official brokerage provider for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.880]   Again, I knew I needed to offer you guys a solution.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.400]   There are a lot of great brokerages.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.080]   I'm not necessarily saying if you're happy with where you are, you don't necessarily
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.200]   have to move.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.700]   You could check it out.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.000]   But if you are looking to establish a brokerage account, someplace where you can hold some
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.600]   stocks, some mutual funds, some ETFs, consider Trade King.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:16.700]   Trade King is a very customer service oriented company that gives great service but has very
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.460]   low cost, $4.95 stock trades, which can be really, really valuable.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.580]   Hey, you can be more efficient than an index fund.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.940]   Go ahead and buy some shares of stock, $4.95 trades, and if there are any applicable account
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.440]   charges, you can read all that stuff on the fine print as you always should when working
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.660]   with financial companies.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.500]   But hey, you can get cheaper expenses than an index fund if you're putting together
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.260]   your own portfolio.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.260]   TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.260]   TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.900]   All right, mortgage credit certificates.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.740]   Let's repeat again what the value is of a mortgage credit certificate.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.920]   First you should know that the mortgage credit certificate program is state specific.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.100]   So the state specific nature of it means that I'm going to talk about Florida, but you
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.220]   will have to research this for your specific state.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:10.740]   I'm not sure that all states are currently operating these programs and the rules are
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.420]   different with each state.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.140]   I was not able to verify and I didn't take the time to go through and read all of the
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.300]   data from all 50 states.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.900]   However, this program was enacted under a 1984 federal tax law.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.640]   So that is available on a federal basis.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.400]   This applies to your federal income taxes.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.900]   So it's available on a federal basis, but your state might have different rules than
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.900]   my state.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.900]   So I'm going to use Florida.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.800]   I have a lot of friends in Florida, so hopefully this will benefit my Florida friends.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.980]   But you need to check out the details in your state.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:49.060]   So in Florida, I'm just going to read right from the Florida Housing Mortgage Credit Certificate
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.540]   Frequently Asked Questions.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:56.780]   A Florida housing mortgage credit certificate allows the home buyer to claim a tax credit
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:04.380]   for 50% of the mortgage interest paid per year, capped at $2,000 annually.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:13.620]   It is a dollar-for-dollar reduction against their federal tax liability.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.580]   So define some terms.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.860]   A tax credit.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.220]   We always know a tax credit is probably going to be more valuable than a deduction, especially
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   when it's a tax credit that's specifically applicable to the tax liability that you owe.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.960]   The way that your normal mortgage interest deduction works is like this.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.500]   Let's say that you have – you're going through and you're putting together your
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.500]   deductions.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.900]   Assume for a moment that you're going to itemize your deductions.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.900]   That's one of the things.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.180]   So you list out what are all of your different itemized deductions.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.940]   Might be – let's just say focus with your mortgage interest.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.580]   Assume in a moment that you have a mortgage payment of $1,000 a month.
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.220]   That's $12,000 per year.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:05.940]   Assume of your $12,000 per year mortgage payment, assume half of that, $6,000, is your interest
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.980]   that you're paying on the loan.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.100]   So you owe – you have $12,000 of mortgage payment, $6,000 of that is interest.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.580]   If you're going to itemize your deductions, which most people don't, but if you're
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:22.620]   going to itemize your deductions, you report that income as a – that mortgage interest
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.620]   expense as a deduction amount.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:32.940]   What it allows you to do is it allows you to offset $6,000 of your income.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.500]   Now this is where – when I teased you at the front with talking about the difference
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:41.060]   between a credit and a deduction, this is why I'm teasing it because there is no 100%
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.560]   deduction for interest normally except what I'm telling you today.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.080]   There is no deduction like that.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.700]   So normally the savings, assume for easy math, you're in a 25% effective tax rate.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:58.180]   So if you knock $6,000 off of your – $6,000 off of your income with a deduction, what
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:04.420]   it's actually doing is saving you $1,500 of federal income taxes.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:12.360]   This is why it's so important to know that it's generally, from a tax savings perspective,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:20.500]   it can be just as good of an idea to send the money to your mortgage company as it is
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.300]   for you to send it to the government.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.660]   You could – it's a better deal for you to spend – I think I got mixed up there.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.940]   I'm broadcasting the show on Facebook Live at the moment, which is kind of interesting
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.980]   and so that was slightly distracting to me.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.420]   It's a new experience for you.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.500]   If you'd like to see me, I'm going to start doing this more and more.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.820]   Just like the Radical Personal Finance Facebook page.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.020]   I feel like I got a little bit tongue-tied there.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.700]   I bet the live audience is laughing at me here.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:51.260]   But the $1,500 that you – you're sending the mortgage company $6,000 so that you can
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.740]   avoid sending the federal government $1,500.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.260]   That is the item that's often laid out.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.400]   But with this mortgage credit certificate, it's a direct tax credit.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.100]   So what you have an opportunity here is you can avoid – you can send $2,000 to the mortgage
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.820]   company and that's a direct $2,000 reduction from what you would be sending to the federal
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.820]   government.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.820]   So first, the Florida mortgage credit certificate is capped at $2,000 and it's eligible for
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.580]   50 percent of the mortgage interest paid.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.420]   So there's nothing extra that you have to do.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.060]   Now, who's qualified and who's eligible?
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.820]   This is one of the things that's really useful.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.900]   So the idea is that the mortgage credit certificate program is supposed to be helping those who
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.060]   have low incomes buy houses.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.260]   But low income is a relative term.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.780]   The way that I found out about this was a few months after I had bought a house back
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.540]   in 2013, closed on December 31, 2012.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.500]   I had to get my homesteading tax exemption done.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.600]   My wife and I wanted to get that tax exemption done.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.060]   So we went and we took a mattress there to the house and we moved a mattress and a few
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.580]   boxes and slept in a mattress on the floor so we could homestead the property for the
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.540]   following calendar year.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.060]   But a few months after I'd moved in, I found out about the idea of a mortgage credit certificate
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.620]   program and I researched it.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.420]   I found out that I would have been able to qualify under the terms of that program.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.740]   Now the income limitations are not onerous.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.340]   I'm going to tell you about Palm Beach County where I live, but in Palm Beach County, if
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:25.540]   you have a one to two person household, you need to make less than $78,720 per year.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:32.420]   Or if you have a three plus person household, you need to make less than $91,840 per year.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.300]   That's pretty reasonable numbers.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.140]   I mean $90,000 a year is almost two times the median income.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.260]   It's not poverty living.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.380]   So for many of you, this can qualify, especially for many of you like me.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.380]   You have a business.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.860]   It's only going to be based upon your net profit from your business.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.700]   So you can still generate more income and as you're building your business, it's only
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.540]   going to be based upon the net profit that you actually reported on.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.900]   What about the size of the house?
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.300]   On Palm Beach County, they have two different tiers where I live.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:05.180]   In Palm Beach County, for a non-targeted area, you can purchase a house that's valued at
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.800]   up to $337,500.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.920]   If you live in a targeted area, and each state has these different definitions.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.740]   In my state, it's based upon, you can look it up, it's based upon some census tracts
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.300]   based upon the US census.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:27.720]   If you live in a targeted area, you can buy a house that's up to $412,500 of cost.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.980]   So when I started looking at that, I realized, wait, I qualified income-wise and I qualified
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.980]   value of my house-wise.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:43.340]   I called up literally the head of the Florida Housing Administration and I wound up speaking
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.900]   to them in the office and I said, "Can I do this retroactively?"
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.760]   I found out that no, it's not possible to do retroactively.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.440]   So this whole program, if you're going to get this tax credit, you've got to know about
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.940]   it in advance.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.820]   You've got to apply for it and get approved in advance.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.820]   And I'll talk about that process.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:06.600]   I'm going to add a little bit of time to the process, but it's not very onerous.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.380]   So for many of you, that's what you need to know.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.180]   Just research it for your state.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.380]   Mortgage credit certificate program save you up to a couple thousand bucks.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.940]   As long as you live in that house and it's your primary residence, and as long as you're
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:27.100]   paying mortgage interest on your loan, this credit will be in force and it can be extremely
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.940]   valuable for you.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.140]   All right.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.140]   So let's dig a little bit deeper now.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.860]   And if you're the kind of person who just needs that broad overview in the first 15
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.140]   minutes here, I provided that for you.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.140]   Let's go medium level and then we'll go to IRS Publication 530 for those of you who are
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.820]   hardcore at the end and give you a couple of tips here.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.940]   I'm just going to read a couple of paragraphs from the introduction to the Florida Mortgage
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:56.140]   Credit Certificate Program, and that'll tell you what they are and how it works.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.780]   Let's do some example calculations here.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.020]   Mortgage credit certificates were authorized by Congress in the 1984 Tax Reform Act.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.940]   So these things have been around for a long time.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.060]   And that was what I found so personally frustrating in buying a house.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.500]   It was my mortgage broker never told me about it.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.740]   My real estate agent never told me about it.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   Nobody told me about it.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.140]   I had to find out about it myself and I found out about it too late.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.060]   So the right time to find out about this is before you've bought a house.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:27.780]   A mortgage credit certificate is a nonrefundable federal income tax credit.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.040]   For those of you who aren't tax wonks, let me define that word nonrefundable.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:39.580]   What that means is you cannot use this credit to generate more of a credit than the tax
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.660]   that you owe.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.420]   There are some tax credits that are refundable and there are some that aren't.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.640]   The most notable one that's often refundable would be the earned income tax credit.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.280]   If you qualify for the earned income tax credit because you have low income but you still
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.460]   qualify into that program, you can get more money back from the federal government than
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.440]   you ever paid in in federal income taxes.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.540]   So that's what they call a refundable credit.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.580]   So it's possible to make more money than you ever paid in taxes.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:13.940]   This is a nonrefundable credit, which means that you either get up to a $2,000 credit
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.980]   or up to the maximum amount of your tax liability.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:23.380]   If you only had $1,000 of tax liability, you lose the last $1,000 of the benefit.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.980]   And those of you who are tax wonks, again, will automatically say, "Is there a carryover?
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.800]   I don't believe there's a carryover for this tax credit."
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.220]   The mortgage credit certificate reduces an eligible borrower's federal income taxes and
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:41.100]   in effect creates additional income for the borrower to use in making mortgage payments.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.940]   That's the key point of this whole thing.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:48.500]   It is calculated in advance and this can help if you are having trouble qualifying for a
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.460]   mortgage based upon income limits, based upon the amount of the mortgage.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.060]   This might help you to be able to purchase a little bit of a bigger house to borrow more
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:02.180]   money than otherwise would be eligible to your situation.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.580]   That's the whole point of this is to help lower income people borrow more money for
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.500]   bigger houses.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:13.020]   Florida Housing offers a mortgage credit certificate with a 50% tax credit amount.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   Your state may vary.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.820]   I've seen some states with 20%, some states with less.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.180]   Check your state out and see what the limitations are on your state.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:27.460]   But what that 50% tax credit amount means, it means that up to 50% of the interest that
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.700]   you're paying on a mortgage is eligible for this credit.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.720]   Homeowners with the credit are allowed to use 50% of the annual mortgage interest up
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.220]   to a maximum of $2,000 as a direct federal tax credit resulting in a dollar for dollar
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.380]   reduction of their annual federal income tax liability.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.240]   This is the awesome part.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.860]   The remainder of the homeowner's annual mortgage interest will continue to qualify as an itemized
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:59.400]   tax deduction for federal income tax purposes.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.180]   You get that?
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.340]   So what's really cool about this credit is if you have a mortgage that has a lot of interest
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:12.060]   on it, you can still use the rest of the mortgage interest that wasn't able to be used under
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.420]   the terms of this credit.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:19.780]   You can still use all of that as itemizable deductible mortgage interest.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:25.700]   Or if that doesn't benefit you, you can still use your standard deduction just like most
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.860]   people do even though they have mortgages.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.100]   Most people still use the standard deduction.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.580]   Please note that the maximum credit allowed in any year is the lesser of 50% of the annual
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.140]   mortgage interest or $2,000.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.440]   So let's go through one of their examples they give right here in the Florida documents.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.340]   For example, a borrower with a loan amount of $100,000 at an interest rate of 4% for
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.760]   30 years pays approximately $4,000 of interest in the first year of the mortgage loan.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.520]   With a 50% mortgage credit certificate, this borrower receives a direct federal income
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.400]   tax credit of $2,000, 50% times $4,000.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.180]   And the borrower treats the remaining $2,000 of mortgage interest paid as an itemized tax
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.540]   deduction.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.580]   Under another example, a borrower with a loan amount of $100,000 at an interest rate of
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.940]   5% for 30 years pays approximately $5,000 of interest in the first year of the mortgage
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.060]   loan.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.740]   With a 50% mortgage credit certificate, this borrower receives a direct federal income
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:33.620]   tax credit of $2,000, which is a lesser of 50% times $5,000, $2,500, and $2,000.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.960]   The borrower treats the remaining $3,000 of mortgage interest paid as an itemized tax
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.320]   deduction.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.160]   The annual benefit to the borrower will be the lesser of the credit amount or the amount
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.040]   of federal taxes owed after all other credits and deductions have been taken.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.260]   The benefit cannot exceed the borrower's federal income tax liability for the year.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.200]   However, it is the carry forward.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   Here we go.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   I was wrong.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.320]   However, if the borrower is unable to use all of the maximum available MCC tax credit
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.940]   in any year, the unused portion of the tax credit can be carried forward three tax years
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.060]   or until used, whichever comes first.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.840]   The MCC will provide the borrower with a federal tax credit for the life of the mortgage loan
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.720]   as long as the borrower occupies the property as his principal residence.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.180]   Should the borrower cease to occupy the property as his primary principal residence or should
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:33.480]   the borrower refinance the mortgage loan related to the MCC, the MCC is revoked.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.600]   So this can be very useful to you and I'm glad that I found that little statement there.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.120]   I had read it earlier, but I apologize for getting confused.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.800]   When you can carry this forward for three years, this is an extremely valuable tax credit.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.840]   Let me not overstate it.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.720]   It's only a $2,000 tax credit.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.960]   This is a potentially valuable tax credit, not extremely, but potentially valuable for
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.080]   some people, some of you to use in your property.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.600]   The key is, is it available?
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.080]   On the Florida documents, they update this every year and they say the program will run
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:11.200]   through December 31, 2016 or until such time as all allocation has been expended.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.240]   So depending on your state and your state's documents and your state's budget, you will
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:25.920]   have to dig into this and find out if they still have funding available.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.240]   When I spoke with the guy who was the head of the Florida Housing Administration a couple
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:35.720]   years ago, he said they were having a lot of trouble advertising it.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.480]   He couldn't get people to pay attention to the program.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.880]   So chances are it's possible that in your state this might still be available.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:48.760]   A couple of comments on borrower income before we dig too deep into the weeds.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.120]   First thing you should know is I think these borrower income limits are relatively generous.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.320]   Again, in Palm Beach County where I live in Florida, and they're based upon the county,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.400]   but in Palm Beach County where I live, which is a higher cost of living county, it's either
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.560]   $80,000 a year for a one to two-person household or $91,000, $92,000 a year for a three-plus
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.720]   person household.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.520]   I think that's – I wouldn't consider that to be low income.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.680]   Other counties that have lower earnings, the lowest that I see right off the bat is there
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:25.920]   are some counties that are as low as say $57,000 of income or $66,000 depending on which option
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.120]   there is.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:33.760]   So the important thing is this is – some income sources are counted in this that aren't
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:42.040]   often counted in other types of calculations, but your assets are not counted.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   These are always the two little tricks that I teach here on Radical Personal Finance is
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:53.360]   many programs, especially government programs, are calculated based upon income.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.880]   If you have developed the skill of frugality and you're able to live a really great lifestyle
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:07.920]   on a low amount of income, often you can qualify for programs based upon your income even if
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.080]   you have hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars of assets.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.280]   It's one of the very valuable things to pay attention to.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.520]   The second thing is when is it's only based upon your gross income, based upon your personal
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   income.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.720]   So when you combine the flexibility of having control over your expenses and being able
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.320]   to qualify for programs based upon income and when you combine that with control over
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.600]   your income through a business, then you wind up being able to take advantage of these programs
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.160]   from time to time as you are able to find them.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.340]   Now you will have to read the requirements in your state.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.200]   You have to report your income.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.380]   You have to do it on your tax returns and you have to demonstrate that to the lender
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.440]   at the time, they're required to look into all of your different income sources.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.200]   I'm going to read that list to you because it's valuable for you to know at least the
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   Florida list.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.920]   So you have to report all of your income.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.680]   But as you and I both know, in a business you can choose when you make your capital
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.920]   investments.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.100]   So if you're planning to buy a home and you'd like to take advantage of this, you might
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.280]   choose to make your capital investments in your business at an advantageous time so that
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:24.320]   that reflects in the lower income when you need it to qualify for a program like this.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.880]   So let's go through a couple of details of the state of Florida.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.440]   In Florida, some of the unique things are to qualify.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   Number one, you must possess an ownership interest in and occupy the residence as a
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.720]   principal residence within 60 days after loan closing.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.160]   No rental properties.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.400]   The borrower must notify the lender and Florida Housing if he or she ceases to occupy the
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.760]   property as the primary residence.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.000]   At that time, the MCC will be revoked and the borrower will no longer be permitted to
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.280]   claim the federal tax credit.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.120]   The borrower must not have owned a principal residence located within or outside the state
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:06.160]   during the three-year period ending on the date the warranty deed is executed.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.800]   A mobile or manufactured home, new or existing, whether or not on a permanent foundation,
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.720]   meets this definition of a principal residence.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.640]   So when I decided to sell my house, unless I come across the deal of the century, which
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.280]   is just so great that I'll ignore this, I determined that I wouldn't own a house for
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.320]   at least three years.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   So that we'll see.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   Who knows?
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.360]   But I might want to buy another house.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.720]   If I buy another house, I'll try to get this program in place.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.000]   But you can't have owned a house within the past three years.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.600]   There are two exceptions to that.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.640]   There are two exceptions to the three-year non-ownership requirement.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.440]   The residence that's purchased is purchased in a targeted area.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.640]   So again, you check this list.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.600]   It shows you the tracts based upon the US Census count.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.320]   And you can look in your state to see where are those different tracts.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.920]   Number two, the borrowers are veterans who purchase a home using the proceeds under a
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.040]   one-time exception allowance.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.840]   So if you are a veteran, you can avoid that three-year rule.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.760]   That might be valuable for some of you.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.240]   As far as veteran, here are the definitions of a veteran.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.200]   A veteran is defined as a person who served in active duty in the United States Armed
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.520]   Forces or Reserves and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.880]   It can be valuable for you.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.200]   The borrower must meet the household income limits for the program and lenders must calculate
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.440]   income by using the procedures of this section.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.320]   And here's where it gets a little bit unique because of all the different types of income
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.240]   that are included.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.400]   Household income is defined as the gross annual income of the mortgagors, those signing the
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   warranty deed, and any other person who is expected to live in the residence being financed,
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   including income received by any household member who is 18 years of age or older, except
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:53.440]   a full-time dependent student, even if they will not be secondarily liable on the mortgage.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.600]   The income calculations for the program household compliance are different than the calculations
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.260]   of income for credit underwriting purposes.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.560]   The MCC program requires that the income of all persons residing in the household, related
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.480]   or unrelated, 18 years of age or older, must be included in the calculation of the household
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.800]   income for program purposes.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.840]   Unlike income that is averaged for credit underwriting, the program is concerned with
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.520]   actual current income from all sources.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.080]   Lenders should consider reviewing the income for the last four to six weeks to determine
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.920]   gross income, as well as compare this income on the previous tax returns for consistency.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.400]   Lenders should not be averaging income.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   Gross monthly income is the sum of current monthly gross pay plus any additional income
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:45.040]   from all sources, continuation of which is probable based on foreseeable economic circumstances.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.800]   Once a lender has determined total gross monthly income for everyone over the age of 18 that
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.560]   will be residing in the property, the lender will then multiply this figure by 12 to determine
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.040]   the combined total household income for program purposes.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.460]   Here is the other income that is included for this calculation.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.040]   The lender should also ask the borrower for specific other income.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:11.460]   Examples are alimony annuities, auto allowance bonuses, child support commissions, disability
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   or death benefits, dividends, education benefits used for subsistence interest, income received
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:23.440]   from business activities or investments income received from trusts, inheritances if received
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:29.000]   on a continuous basis, insurance policies if received on a continuous basis, net rental
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.520]   income, overtime, pensions, public assistance, recurring monetary contributions regularly
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:42.840]   received from persons not living in the unit, royalties, shift differential sick pay, social
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.420]   security benefits, special pay and allowances of a member of the armed forces excluding
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:54.140]   hazardous duty pay, tips, and veteran administration compensation, workers' compensation.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.120]   Those sources of income are all included.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.840]   What is excluded?
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.980]   The following types of income can be excluded in determining a borrower's income eligibility.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.520]   The amounts of educational scholarships paid directly to the student or to the educational
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.300]   institution, amounts paid by the government to a veteran for use in meeting the costs
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.960]   of tuition, fees, books, and equipment, amounts that are specifically for reimbursement of
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:25.520]   business and/or educational expenses, one-time sign-on bonus, lump sum additions to family
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:31.000]   assets such as inheritance, insurance payments, including payments under health and accident
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.520]   insurance and workers' compensation, capital gains and settlement for personal or property
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.760]   losses, payments received for the care of foster children, sporadic or irregular gifts,
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.520]   payments that are specifically for or in reimbursement of the cost of medical expenses, and severance
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.720]   pay.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.640]   So it's a little bit tedious to go through those lists, but for some of you, based upon
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:59.080]   looking at your specific situation, you might be able to find some options that work.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.640]   In addition, a couple of things, cosigners are not permitted in this program.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:09.320]   Non-occupying co-borrowers are not permitted in Florida Housing's MCC program, and eligible
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.280]   borrowers must attend a six- to eight-hour face-to-face homebuyer education class.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.920]   There are some requirements on the type of property.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:25.200]   All of them are fairly standard, fairly reasonable standards that are applied.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.680]   They all make sense.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:33.000]   The key thing with this is if you want to participate in this program, you must do it
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.720]   in advance, and you must work with a lender who is a participating lender in the program.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.880]   So this will require some homework from you in advance.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.960]   Eligible borrowers apply for the program with participating lenders by completing a standard
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.600]   mortgage application.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.200]   The Florida Housing Compliance Review is conducted after the lender has approved, closed the
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:00.160]   mortgage loan, and the borrower has executed all necessary closing documentation.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.760]   If the loan meets the applicable MCC compliance guidelines, the lender's underwriter issues
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.020]   an approval.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:14.720]   So pay attention, share this with other people, and make sure they know before the fact.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.240]   I think it'll take a little bit longer.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   You got to pay attention.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.080]   You got to work with a certain lender.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.460]   But hey, for $2,000 a year of savings, $2,000 that I can spend on something else, I'm willing
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.080]   to do that.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.360]   There are some other details.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.040]   I was going to go deeper into the weeds, but in just looking at my notes here, I think
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.120]   I'm going to stop this deep dive.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.440]   I will link to the Florida programs in the show notes for today's show, but you need
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.100]   to look to your own state and read your own state's documents.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.400]   There is some information in publication 530 from the IRS.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:51.240]   That's the publication that talks about all the deductions surrounding and available with
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   housing.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.780]   So you can find more details about that.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.780]   But I think that's deep enough.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.880]   There is a recapture.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.920]   You have to stay in the house for at least eight years, otherwise there can be a recapture
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.640]   of some of this benefit.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.440]   So this is not something that you'll want to do if you are just going to live there
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.000]   a few years.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:16.280]   But if you want to live in a house and have some extra money, discount your taxes, man,
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.280]   I'll do that.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:23.720]   I think there are some intelligent ways that you can use to adjust this.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:30.760]   And $2,000 a year of extra cost is a not insubstantial amount of money to put things over in favor
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.160]   of owning the house.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.240]   One of the questions that I had when thinking about it was considering is there a way – can
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.320]   you refinance the property from time to time?
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.760]   The answer is yes, you can refinance it.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.600]   But you have to refinance the property and seek approval before the refinance.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.920]   It's possible that the new loan wouldn't be approved before – at least in Florida.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.440]   It's possible that if the new loan weren't approved for the program, then you could lose
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   it.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   So you would want to be careful with that.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.840]   As with anything, read the fine print.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.280]   But I guess for me, this one is important to me simply because I was always frustrated
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   that no one told me.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.240]   It seems like – and at the time, I was a financial planner.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.120]   I was a – I don't know, a CFP.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.960]   I should know about this stuff.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   I didn't know about it.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   So I've told all of the people that I can think of some ways to save money on their
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   house and do people – does it work out in all situations?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   No.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.360]   But check into it in your situation and see if you can find some radical and intelligent
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.880]   way to make this work.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   So I hope that's useful.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.480]   I know we didn't get too technical with all of that.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.040]   But for those of you who have been missing these – the Wednesday financial planning
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.800]   shows, they're coming.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   I'm working on them.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.240]   I appreciate each and every one of you listening.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.840]   Couple of quick notes.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.880]   One is I have put this video out on Facebook for today's show.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.040]   I think I'll do more of that in the future.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:59.200]   I've wanted to do this and put them out on Periscope but I just didn't get a lot
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.160]   of traction there with Periscope.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.840]   So I do like this Facebook because Facebook is much more integrated now that Facebook
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.320]   is going live with their Facebook Live feature.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.560]   It's a cool option.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.320]   I like that I can chat and I can see who's watching.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.360]   Then you all can comment down the road.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   You can see how I do the show.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.960]   I'll do more of this stuff in the future.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   Today I'm just recording.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.840]   But if you'd like to do that, come on over to the Radical Personal Finance Facebook
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   page.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   Go to Facebook.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.960]   Number two is when I hang up the phone here in about 25 minutes, I'm getting ready
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:33.240]   to launch our Q&A call for the Friday Q&A show.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.480]   That's one of the benefits available to patrons.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.260]   So if you'd like to support the show and if you'd like to interact with me personally,
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.420]   you can partly do that in the comments on a Facebook Live video.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.500]   You can always email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.160]   But also consider becoming a member of the patron program.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.640]   I've been working on reworking that, making it much simpler and providing benefits that
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.220]   I can deliver on.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.360]   You can find the two major benefits that I've settled on is access to our Radical Personal
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.960]   Finance Irregulars Facebook group.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   That's become a community.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.440]   It's about 80 people right now.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.680]   Just an awesome community of people interacting, answering questions for one another.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.280]   That has been a really awesome community.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.600]   There are people there that are smarter than me.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.720]   So you can gain access to that.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.960]   Many of the members there say it's their favorite thing about what I do just to gain access
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.080]   to the diversity of thought there.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.000]   People who are listeners of the show, knowledgeable in these things.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.320]   Also you get access to the Friday Q&A calls.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:30.360]   So if you're not supporting the show as a patron, consider coming over to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.800]   Love to have you there and you get some of those benefits and hopefully that can be valuable
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   for you.
