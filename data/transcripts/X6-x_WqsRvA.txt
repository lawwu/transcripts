[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   from Loyad from India.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.280]   I often take on multiple projects,
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.240]   but then they, as they become hard, I abandon them halfway.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.040]   How do I stop doing this?
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.040]   - All right, so we have a very consistent type theme today.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.180]   I think the reader could,
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.760]   or the listener could almost answer this question
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.000]   on their own now, which is my goal.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.580]   I really want to hammer this point home as much as I can.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.760]   So Loyad, why are you abandoning projects
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.380]   when they become hard halfway?
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   - Well, as you can imagine, I'm gonna have two parts
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.760]   to my answer here.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.780]   One is mindset.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.000]   If your mindset is one that depends on external power
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.060]   for you to get through goals,
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.240]   you are not gonna get very far in hard projects
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.220]   because the external power, which in this case
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.400]   is that actual emotional feeling of motivation,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.760]   excitement will die down as projects go on,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.080]   as they get harder, and then you'll stop doing them.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.440]   So you need to reshape your mindset towards one
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.120]   and seeing yourself as someone who can handle
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.920]   internally powered goals.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.360]   Guess I'm gonna suggest you do that.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.720]   Layer one of the deep life stack,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.040]   two to three daily disciplines,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.400]   non-trivial, but tractable, everyday mark 'em.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.440]   Just train your mind.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.120]   I do things that are important for me,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.280]   even if they're hard, even if I'm not excited in the moment,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820]   and there's a deeper satisfaction I get out of that.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.500]   That's why I trust myself to do this going forward.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.080]   Secondly, the issue here is gonna be similar
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.760]   to what I talked to both Fahad and Jacob about.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   You might just have too many projects
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.240]   and they might just actually be too hard.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.600]   So be very careful about that.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.840]   I think one project worked on consistently
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.440]   and slowly over time is gonna, in the end,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.680]   open up more opportunities and have more impact
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.760]   in multiple projects that you're trying to tackle
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.120]   in a frenzied burst.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.160]   So it's sort of a key slow productivity principle here,
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.700]   work on fewer things.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.180]   So you might just have too many projects.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.640]   Again, you have this impatience of I'm young
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.380]   and there's so much I wanna do and I have to make my mark,
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.880]   and you don't realize just choose the one thing
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.400]   that you patiently start building your skill on.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.800]   It's frustrating maybe now when you're 22,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.600]   but by the time you're 24, 25, and that's bearing fruit,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.440]   the fruit is gonna be so much riper and sweeter
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.840]   than if you had spilled that time instead,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   just jumping from thing to thing,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   trying to jump from the latest idea to the latest interest.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.280]   I mean, I knew someone like this in college, Jesse,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.920]   and I kind of remember his name,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320]   but I'm not sure if I have his name right.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.560]   And maybe I should anonymize it anyways.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.940]   But I knew about him because he was my year at college,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.020]   maybe he was a year younger,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.340]   and he was the only other person I knew
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.300]   who was trying to write a book.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.980]   And so he had interest in books,
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.940]   but he had all these other interests as well.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.980]   Like he was interested in politics
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.120]   because Dartmouth is in Hanover, which is in New Hampshire.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.460]   So when the presidential season would come through,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.680]   which happened twice when I was there,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.700]   everyone comes to New Hampshire because of the primaries.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.140]   You get lots of political figures coming through.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.440]   So he was also getting really involved
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.060]   in helping to like organize,
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.560]   I believe it was a debate for the 2004 presidential election
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.940]   and he had this other project going on.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.560]   And so there was this real sense,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.500]   I remember, man, he's doing a lot of things.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.380]   Book writing was one of them, all these different projects.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.940]   It's the excitement of, he was very capable,
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.740]   very capable in all these different things
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.500]   that could make my market.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.580]   I was not that way.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.100]   I wanted to, I was just writing.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   I was doing my CS work and writing.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.900]   And I just, that was my main thing
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.740]   outside of my schoolwork was just writing.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.940]   And I just, I wanted to write this book and do it well
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.620]   and then immediately turn around and sell another.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.940]   But I just wanted to make my writing better.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.460]   And I was willing to put my time, just focus on that.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.820]   And so there's this point early on,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.020]   we're both kind of working on books
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.380]   and he had a lot of other stuff going on,
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.940]   but all that stuff, I don't know what happened to it,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.820]   but I just kept focusing on books.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.580]   And I wrote another book and I was a little bit better.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.300]   And then I took some time and wrote a third book,
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.220]   which was much better.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.620]   And then it set up my fourth book, which was a hardcover.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.420]   And now that has borne much more interesting fruit.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.180]   I have actually, it took me a long time,
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.980]   but I've developed myself into a writer
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.460]   who can have a career as a writer.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.940]   So in the moment when I was 20 or 21,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.780]   it seemed maybe naively slow,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.180]   like I'm just gonna work on this book
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.020]   and try to make it good.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.940]   I don't wanna be distracted.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.660]   But looking back as a 41 year old,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.880]   I said, man, I'm so glad I stayed focused on that
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.900]   because how much interesting stuff has making writing
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.600]   one of my two core focuses of my life really opened up.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.180]   So Llyod, slowing down, doing less things,
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.220]   sticking with that in a sustainable pace
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.100]   over a long period of time,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.900]   that's typically what you wanna be doing
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.900]   if your goal is either impact
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.140]   or opening up interesting opportunities in your life
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.300]   or some combination of those two.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.260]   That slow productivity approach is probably better.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.640]   So that might be what's going on as well,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.420]   is your mind is so overwhelmed, this is too much.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.220]   So we got mindset and we have your mind being reasonable.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.660]   So your mindset might be off.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.540]   You need external power.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.860]   We fixed that through practice.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.700]   Your mind might be working perfectly fine
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   and is making the reasonable observation
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.020]   that now this is too much work.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.860]   We have too many things.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.260]   We can't possibly be making a difference in all of these.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.780]   They're beginning to conflict with each other.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.480]   So you might actually just have to think about doing less.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.700]   - Actually focusing is one of the main messages
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.540]   in your student books,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.780]   like where you tell people not to do
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.180]   like a thousand activities and stuff like that.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.500]   - Yeah, in fact, I was reminded that,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.980]   so I'm back at Dartmouth
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.320]   and I didn't really remember this till I got up there.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.300]   I was like, oh, I've been back a bunch of times
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.900]   over the course of the last couple of decades to give talks.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.840]   And one of the first talks I gave,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.980]   there's an old poster of this I have somewhere
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.900]   in my basement, I'd forgotten about this.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.900]   I think it was a year out of college.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.220]   I came back to Dartmouth
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.500]   and gave a lecture to students there
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.420]   about navigating their student career.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.700]   And this was one of the big points I was making
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.460]   was do fewer things.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.700]   Do fewer things, do 'em really well.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.620]   You are much better off, for example,
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.200]   being the best student in the computer science department
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.420]   than you are being the student
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.100]   with the hardest schedule on campus.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.900]   I have three majors and I'm doing these impossible.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.860]   You're much better off saying,
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.300]   I'm only a computer science student.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.460]   And in fact, I balance my computer science courses
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.940]   with easier courses and I take full advantage
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.900]   of independent studies and thesis studies
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.140]   where I can reduce my course load, but still get credits.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.100]   And so, my course load is very, very manageable.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.700]   And what I do is I take that energy
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.140]   to become the best student
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.660]   in those computer science classes.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.760]   That is way, way more valuable than I did a triple major
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.900]   or I had really hard semesters.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.340]   No one cares how hard your semesters are.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.260]   Similarly, I wrote a book.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.500]   I wrote a book for Random House.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   It's gonna get you much farther than I.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.700]   I had six different clubs.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.880]   You know how hard that was?
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.480]   I was a treasurer here and I ran this.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.980]   I did this initiative.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.100]   No one's keeping track of that.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.940]   No one cares.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.380]   I mean, they're like, yeah, you seem like a go-getter,
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.220]   but it doesn't catch their attention.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.900]   People care about the thing you do best.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.480]   So, you're almost always better off
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.740]   making your best things as good as possible,
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.460]   which almost always requires doing less.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.140]   And this was, again, this came out of my advocacy
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.980]   about student stress, which I did this 2004 to 2007 period.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.160]   I did a lot of this, a lot of talks
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.420]   all over the country about this.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.460]   And at the core of my advocacy about student stress
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.440]   was students need to do much less.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.060]   There's only so much that tactics and strategies
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.300]   and time management, they can only get you so far
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.700]   if you have too many courses and activities.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.220]   And then as a college student,
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.440]   there's no real reason to do a lot of things
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.780]   because no one in your future is gonna care about that.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.720]   There is no college admissions officer type figure
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.540]   in your future who is going to pore over
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.180]   what you did at college and say,
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.540]   how hard was their schedule?
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.580]   Let's get letters.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.380]   They say, this person was really impressive.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.660]   They worked on all these things.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.920]   How hard were their course load?
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.300]   No one looks at that after college.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.380]   If you're trying to go to grad school,
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.140]   it's gonna be a professor evaluating your application.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.140]   And what do they wanna know?
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.980]   Where'd you go to school?
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.020]   What grades did you get in your major?
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.500]   Have you demonstrated you can do research?
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.660]   That's all they care.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.580]   It's all they care about.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.900]   They're not gonna look at your, oh my God,
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.660]   they had three, this was a really complicated schedule
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.540]   or look at these activities.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.500]   They could care less.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.560]   You're gonna work for a company.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.000]   Typically, they wanna know, where'd you go to school?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.580]   What was your GPA?
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.060]   How'd they do in the interview?
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.260]   That's what they care about.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.040]   And again, we're gonna see this again and again.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.880]   Go to law school.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.700]   What do they care about?
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.300]   Here's LSAT's GPA.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.420]   You can look up the grid school by school.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.500]   This LSAT requires this GPA to have a high chance
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.720]   of getting in for basically every school
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.180]   except for maybe Yale.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.060]   That's what you need to do.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.100]   I have this grade point average.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.940]   I need this LSAT score.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.760]   Practice till I get it.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.600]   Now I can get it, right?
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.220]   No one is gonna be pouring over your resume
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.100]   to see how hard your schedule is or how stressed you were.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.740]   So that became a big core of my student advocacy,
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.420]   stress advocacy, was avoid unforced error, students.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.380]   Create schedules and loads that are very manageable
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.820]   and then do what you do really well.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.980]   Do a small number of things well
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.140]   is such a more sustainable strategy.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.060]   And in the end, opens up more opportunities
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.980]   than I did a lot of hard.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.220]   I had a hard schedule and did a lot of things okay.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.460]   So that was a big part of my schedule.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.180]   You know, the other part of my,
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.700]   this is going off tangent, Jesse,
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.180]   but I was talking about this at a student event
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.060]   the other week up at Dartmouth.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.060]   We kind of brought up all this.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.140]   I dredged up all of this stuff I used to do
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.340]   around student stress advocacy way back when.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.820]   And I remember the other thing,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.940]   the other thing that came up often
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.860]   was when student stress became a big issue,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.260]   especially at the high school level,
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.980]   the response, and I think this is still
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.540]   sort of an instinct we have right now,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.940]   the response was all of these Ivy League educated
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.340]   commentators who are writing about this,
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.820]   thinking like Alexander Robbins or Denise Pope
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.900]   would then turn to these aspirational students
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.900]   who were stressing themselves out
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.340]   trying to get into like an Ivy League school
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.100]   and say, guys, there's more to life
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.180]   than going to a good school.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.420]   You know, just chill out about it.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.260]   And this was completely falling flat
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.660]   because here they were with their Stanford
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.980]   and Yale degrees saying like, well, I did it.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.420]   And I'm doing this kind of cool stuff
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.580]   and I'm kind of famous, but like, just go to the,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.260]   you're so, you're kind of, in fact, you're flawed
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.980]   and especially your parents are flawed
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.580]   for pushing you to actually wanna come here.
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.220]   Just temper your ambition.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.820]   So it was very much this pull up the drawbridge
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.780]   behind you type of mentality that just wasn't working.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.260]   The students who were most stressed,
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.740]   if you came to them with your Ivy League diploma
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.420]   on the wall and said, there's more to life
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.780]   than going to an Ivy League,
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.060]   they would 100% tune you out.
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.220]   'Cause they would say, I disagree.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.820]   You look like you're doing something cool.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.260]   I wanna do something cool like that.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.780]   If the only thing you can offer me is be less ambitious,
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.220]   I'm sorry, but I'm gonna ignore you
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.460]   and go back to whatever's caused me all the stress
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.380]   and causing all these troubles.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.940]   And so I was also back then, this 2005, 2006 period,
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.620]   this lone voice out there in the student stress debates.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.820]   And this is when they really picked up speed.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.460]   When the millennial demographic bump hit up
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.660]   against limited college admission slot,
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.820]   when the common application became widespread
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.620]   and now you could apply to 50 colleges pretty easily.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.900]   This is when acceptance rates plummeted, right?
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.860]   So the 2000s, early 2000s,
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.540]   this is when it became a real problem.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.060]   And I was out there as a lone voice
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.540]   among these other voices saying,
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.980]   what you have to offer students
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.060]   is an alternative path to their ambitions.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.860]   You have to keep the ambition in the question.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.780]   Okay, you wanna go to a really good school.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.020]   I'm not gonna try to talk you out of that.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.420]   I mean, I want you to know it's okay if that doesn't happen,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.740]   but I'm not gonna tell you you're bad
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.700]   or your parents are flawed
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.540]   for thinking you wanna go to Harvard or whatever.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.660]   But let's talk about how you do that.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.500]   And actually this path of overloading yourself
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.460]   and just trying to grind it out is not very successful.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.420]   Here's alternative paths where you could be very interesting
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.740]   and have a good shot at these schools,
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.140]   but your life is very sustainable.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.660]   And I used to call it the Zen Valedictorian Strategy.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.620]   And I wrote a lot about it, talked a lot about it.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.740]   My third book is actually about this strategy.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.820]   I followed five kids who got into really good schools
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.300]   without being stressed and deconstructed.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.500]   How in the world did they do this, right?
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.860]   And so I was the lone voice out there often
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.180]   that would say, I think it's completely fine.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.220]   You have to recognize and accept people's ambitions
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.860]   and then start giving them more sustainable strategies
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.820]   for pursuing those ambitions.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.780]   We're way off Loyal's question at this point.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.460]   But anyways, I was just thinking about this.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.220]   I was talking to all these college students the other day.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.660]   We did a student dinner
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.340]   and I was talking to a lot of them about,
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.420]   'cause they had just gone through this
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.500]   to get into Dartmouth.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.660]   I believe Dartmouth's acceptance right now is negative 2%.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.660]   Like they actually kick out
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.860]   a certain number of people each year.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.740]   I think to get into an Ivy League school today,
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.580]   you have to work really hard in STEM classes in high school,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.460]   get to the head of those classes,
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.180]   use those technology to invent a time machine,
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.820]   then bring yourself back to 1997.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.820]   It's negative acceptance.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.780]   You actually have to go back in time to be accepted.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.340]   I think they try to reduce the number of students
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.180]   there every year.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.780]   I don't know.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.660]   That's all neither here nor there.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.580]   I'm just in this mindset.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.940]   I don't know why I'm in this mindset again,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.820]   but I guess Jesse, you caused all this by saying,
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.540]   I talk about focus in my student books.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.140]   And I was like, yeah, like in my student books,
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.260]   I really was trying to just be very clear about,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.940]   here's how a lot of students do really well.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.940]   And a lot of it's not doing too much,
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.260]   being organized about what you do,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.660]   but keeping your load manageable
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.260]   and actually it's a very sustainable path.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.700]   - Yeah.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.100]   - Not completely out of nowhere though,
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.100]   because I think we'll see this final question.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.140]   I think it's gonna be relevant to this final question.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.100]   - All right, last question from a CS student.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.380]   In a previous podcast, you mentioned not to work
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.860]   for 10 hours at a time, like many productivity YouTubers do.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.460]   Can you explain why not?
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.540]   These YouTubers are often the biggest names
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.180]   in YouTube productivity and seem like
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.940]   they're excellent students and are creating
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.380]   long-term deep life habits from it.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.340]   As long as you make sure to avoid shallow work,
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.340]   I was wondering why is working 10 hours a day a problem?
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.940]   - Have you seen these videos, Jesse?
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.140]   - No.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.580]   - People have been sending them to me.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.260]   - I've taken your advice like even before I knew you
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.700]   about like the no, you can't see any other videos
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.780]   on the homepage.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.620]   - Yes.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.460]   - So I only--
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.500]   - The plugin that takes the recommendations off of YouTube.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.340]   - Yeah.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.300]   - By the way, I'm a big believer in that still.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.780]   YouTube is a great library,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.180]   it's a terrible television channel.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.700]   That's what I always say.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.500]   So to use it as a library,
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.540]   I wanna learn how to do this thing.
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.100]   And I can search and find videos on how to replace the oil
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.580]   in my very particular type of car.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.540]   It's an excellent library.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.740]   Or I wanna look up, I've heard about Cal Newport,
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.500]   I like Cal Newport, I know his podcast is on YouTube,
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.900]   so I can have that bookmarked.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.220]   And I'm going there to look up Cal Newport videos
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.140]   to see his podcast, that's great.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.700]   To use it as a TV channel,
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.460]   let me just click on a recommendation
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.740]   and then see if the recommendations are more interesting
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.580]   than what I'm watching and click on those recommendations
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.980]   and sort of following those rabbit holes,
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.780]   that is more dangerous.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.020]   But anyways, there's a whole productivity YouTube
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.100]   where these YouTubers do these over the top,
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.100]   I think of it as a sort of nerd version
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.380]   of David Blaine productivity endurance challenges.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.260]   I guess it's time-lapse, but 10 hours studying straight.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.660]   And they make it sort of heroic.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.340]   This often works well on YouTube.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.100]   If the thing you're doing is over the top,
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.940]   you take whatever emotional reaction
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.380]   that is relevant to that topic.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.580]   So you see someone well-organized and studying well,
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.900]   and you're like, "Oh, I kind of have an affinity for that.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.100]   I wanna be a better student."
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.940]   And then you show someone doing it for 10 hours,
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.300]   you push it over the top,
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.700]   it takes that emotional response
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.700]   and pushes over the top, that's engagement.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.860]   And people watch these videos and get really into it.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.180]   So it's a classic YouTube strategy
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.820]   being applied to the topic of productivity.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.900]   So why not study for 10 hours a day?
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.500]   You can see in the student's question,
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.980]   these are big names on YouTube.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.820]   These people are YouTube famous.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.860]   They seem like they're really good students.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.100]   Why? There's a clarity to it.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.020]   There's an extremeness to it, a sort of monastic discipline
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.020]   to all I do is study all day.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.660]   And I guess my answer to the CS student,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.580]   it would be to turn the question back on you
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.540]   and say, "To what end?"
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.700]   So what are you trying to accomplish
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.580]   if you're working 10 hours a day on schoolwork?
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.700]   Well, you might say, "Well,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.380]   then for sure I'll get into med school."
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.940]   Okay, so then what?
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.140]   Well, okay, I guess I would study 10 hours a day
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.620]   in med school so that I could graduate top my class
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.580]   and get a really good residency.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.460]   Okay, well, then what?
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.300]   Well, then I would work 10 hours a day
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.420]   so I could do research.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.860]   I could be the very best resident
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.260]   and get sort of an academic clinical position.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.100]   Okay, well, then what?
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.260]   Well, then I'd really wanna do 10 hours
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.100]   because if I could fill every hour
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.900]   working on my medical research and clinician practice,
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.500]   I could move up really quickly and become an attending
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.980]   and get tenure at the associate university very quickly.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.900]   It was like, all right, well, then what?
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.780]   If I really worked 10 hours all day long,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.980]   then I could probably become chair
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.300]   of this particular medical department
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.740]   and bring in all this different money
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.700]   and we could really expand the hospitals.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.580]   And then what?
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.980]   You keep following this out and you look back and say,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.500]   "All I've done is just work really hard."
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.600]   What about all the other elements of life?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.340]   So where is there in this point some sort of victory
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.340]   where you say now I can have a full rich experience of life?
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.100]   It's just working for the sake of working
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.580]   because of what's next.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.740]   Putting aside the fact that it's completely unsustainable
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.940]   and these YouTubers don't work 10 hours all the time.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.780]   Again, it's like looking at David Blaine
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.460]   freezing himself into a block of ice.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.820]   He doesn't spend most days frozen to a block of ice,
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.580]   but it got a lot of engagement when he did that
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.340]   as a stunt for a television special.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.420]   They're not spending their day doing this all the time.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.580]   It's not a sustainable way to live,
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.020]   but even if it was, in general,
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.260]   this is like let me grind and work all of my hours
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.260]   so I can get to the next level at the very highest level.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.780]   It's not sustainable because it keeps going.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.100]   Now, there are some exceptions to this.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.780]   Like sure, some professional caliber
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.460]   Olympic athletes do this,
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.340]   but they're doing this for a very narrow window
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.460]   because they have until they're, what, 33
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.500]   before they have to move on and live the rest of your life.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.180]   It's very different if you're training
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.380]   for the Olympics like this with this level of intensity
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.860]   because it's a in-dated thing.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.420]   But if you're talking about your career as a student
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.260]   to your professional career,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.820]   there's no place where that ends essentially until you die.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.900]   What type of life is that?
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.420]   So why don't you work for 10 hours a day
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.620]   because it's not living.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.980]   It's a sort of parody of workism
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.460]   if I'm gonna take a term from Derek Thompson.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.460]   So what works better?
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.500]   Slow productivity.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.700]   Working with good focus and good organization
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.940]   on things that matter consistently
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.380]   and systematically over time.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.180]   This can produce work of real impact, of real meaning.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.140]   It can open up all sorts of interesting opportunities
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.980]   in your life.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.820]   It can allow you to do
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.660]   and accomplish very competitive things.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.660]   And it's compatible with a well-rounded life.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.620]   And it's compatible with, I don't just work all the time.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.060]   I'm not just always stressed out.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.980]   I'm not just always overwhelmed and trying to keep up
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.380]   or compete with someone else.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.100]   It often also produces, in a lot of fields, better results.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.740]   You don't see the very best novelists
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.980]   that are winning all the awards
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.580]   getting there because they spend more hours
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.940]   working on their novel every day.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.100]   No, it's this sort of slow and steady work on their writing.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.540]   They're very careful and intentional about their time.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.060]   They think, they read, they walk, they integrate,
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.900]   and they come back and write.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.340]   And you get really great,
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.180]   you know, it's where you're gonna get
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.020]   a sort of wholesome whitehead,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.740]   is out of the slow development of real talent,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.260]   not out of, I wrote 12 hours each day
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.500]   and the other writers are only writing six hours each day.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.740]   Now, I think there's a comfort in this
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.380]   for very ambitious young people,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.580]   because it makes you think,
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.780]   it gives you a very simple framework.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.700]   I turn this knob of hours.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.300]   The higher the knob you turn up on hours,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.900]   the more successful you'll be.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.900]   Most people aren't gonna turn the knob past this point
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.860]   because they're weak.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.740]   I'm not weak.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.180]   If I'm willing to take the pain,
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.580]   it's very simple what I need to do.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.420]   It's just hard.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.580]   It's just keeping my hand in a metaphorical ice bucket
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   longer than you did.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.140]   I like this.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.140]   I'm gonna do 10 hours.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.300]   You're only gonna do four.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.260]   I'll be more successful.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.780]   So it makes success seem much more controllable.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.540]   It's just a matter of raw will.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.380]   But again, that's not the reality.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.940]   Great work, innovative work in academia,
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.580]   in the arts, in business or business strategy
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.180]   has its busy periods, but is not built upon,
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.660]   I have to be working all the time.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.140]   So I just think it's no real way to live.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.300]   I just say, this is why I come back
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.860]   to my original question, to what end?
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.500]   What comes next after your 10 hours a day as a student?
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.420]   What comes next after your 10 hours a day
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.460]   as the investment banker junior associate?
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.300]   Because you took that job
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.300]   because it was the most competitive,
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.460]   the hardest one to get.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.540]   What comes next after you get managing director
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.740]   at the investment bank?
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.620]   What comes next after you go off
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.660]   to start your own hedge fund?
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.340]   What comes next after you hit the billion dollar valuation?
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.900]   I mean, there's always things
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.060]   you could be overworking yourself towards,
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.340]   but again, to what end?
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.180]   What comes next?
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.260]   These are the questions I always come back to.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.580]   So I think it's a stunt
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.900]   what these productivity YouTubers are doing.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.060]   I've spent my entire life in professional academia.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.060]   The smartest people don't do that.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.660]   They work hard, and undergraduate, they don't, right?
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.340]   I mean, because it's not that hard.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.900]   They work hard in periods and other periods.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.820]   They're in thinking periods.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.660]   They have other types of things going on.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.700]   So I'm just not, this idea that you're gonna somehow just,
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.740]   I love the simplicity of it,
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.860]   but this idea that you're gonna somehow
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.540]   just out-raw number everyone else
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.980]   and that's where your success is gonna come from.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.260]   It just is not sustainable.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.580]   It goes against the deep life that we talk about here.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.940]   It's way out of balance, over the top,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.900]   and really not the right way in my mind
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.500]   to build a life of intentionality and depth.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.180]   All that's new, Jesse, this like work 10 hours thing,
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.420]   it's because it worked on YouTube.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.260]   - Yeah.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.020]   - And I think for young people, they see it,
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.140]   they don't realize how new it is.
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.860]   If someone just figured this out a few years ago,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.460]   that it's very compelling content to be like,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.100]   man, I just studied 10 hours.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.060]   You watch them doing it, you're like, man, they did it.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.900]   They stuck with it.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.700]   And look at, that's great.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.700]   It just seems so simple.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.540]   I don't know.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.100]   It's like the productivity equivalent of David Goggins
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.100]   doing, just ran all day long
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.020]   or did pushups till my arm fell off.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.620]   - It's like when we heard Mr. Beast talk about,
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.740]   if you want a compelling video
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.580]   and you don't have a lot of money,
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.260]   you can put together paperclips
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.900]   for multiple football fields and people will watch it.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.740]   - Yep.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.660]   Or what was his, how high can he count?
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.500]   - Yeah.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.820]   - He counted to like a million or something
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.700]   and it took him 12 hours.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.620]   Yeah, it works on YouTube.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.380]   It's not actually a strategy for productivity.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.820]   It's a strategy for getting good views on a YouTube video.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.660]   So I don't know.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.380]   Maybe our YouTube videos will be the counterpoint
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.500]   for the youth out there or old man videos.
