[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   It's a sad state of affairs when some of the most influential voices in our country
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.200]   will label someone a lover or supporter of dictators simply because you're saying, "Hey,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.760]   we shouldn't be going to war." There is another way.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.680]   The following is a conversation with Tulsi Gabbard, who was a longtime Democrat,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.320]   including being the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. She endorsed Bernie in 2016
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.520]   and Biden in 2020. She has been both loved and heavily criticized for her independent thinking
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   and bold political stances, especially on topics of war and the military-industrial complex.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.720]   She served in the U.S. military for many years, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.040]   and now she is the author of a new book called For Love of Country. This is the Lex Friedman
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.840]   podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.880]   dear friends, here's Tulsi Gabbard. You've served in the U.S. military for many years,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.120]   achieving rank of lieutenant colonel. You were deployed in Iraq in 2004 and '05, Kuwait in 2008
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.800]   and '09. What lessons about life and about country have you learned from that experience of war?
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:33.520]   So many. Central to those lessons learned was having my eyes open to the very real cost of war.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   Of course, I served in a medical unit during that first deployment to Iraq. It was 2005 during the
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.480]   height of that war. And unfortunately, we took a lot of casualties, we across the entire U.S.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.720]   military. My brigade that I deployed with was from the Hawaii National Guard. We had approximately
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.320]   3,000 soldiers who were operating in four different areas of Iraq. And my first task every
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.160]   day was to go through a list of every injury, combat-related injury that had occurred the day
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:20.240]   before in the country. And I went through that list name by name, looking to see if any one of
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.160]   our nearly 3,000 soldiers from Hawaii had been hurt in the line of duty. And then if seeing them
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.080]   on the list, tracking them down, where were they? Were they getting the care they needed? Would they
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.520]   be able to get sufficient care to stay in country and return to duty? Did I need to get them
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.440]   evacuated? Usually it would be to military hospitals that at that time were in Landstuhl
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   and Ramstein in Germany. And then from there, getting them to either Brook Army Medical Center,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.920]   which is here in Texas that specialized in burn-related injuries or to Walter Reed,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.160]   and tracking them and their care until they were finally home with their families.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.760]   And it never became a routine task. It never became like,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.080]   "Okay, cool. Check the list." You know, kind of dot the I's, cross the T's. It was that daily
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.160]   confrontation with the reality of the cost of war. Friends of mine were killed in combat.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.720]   Experiencing firsthand that high human cost of war caused me, you know, 20-something-year-old
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   from Hawaii. I'd left my seat in the state legislature to volunteer to deploy with my
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.160]   brothers and sisters in my unit to Iraq. And so recognize the cost of war, I think,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.640]   in two fundamental ways. Number one is the high human cost of war on our troops
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.720]   and on the people in the country where this war was being waged, and also the cost on American
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.960]   taxpayers. Seeing then back, again, 2005 and recognizing KBR Halliburton, one of the biggest
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.040]   defense contracting companies then, and I know that they are still very much in that business now,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.400]   Dick Cheney being connected with that company at one point or another.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.240]   But in our camp specifically, which was one of the larger ones in Iraq at that time,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.360]   there wasn't anything that happened in our camp that didn't have the KBR Halliburton
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.800]   logo imprinted on it. We had a big shack-looking place where we ate our meals. They call it a
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.880]   dining facility, a DFAC in the military. And they serve four meals a day. They brought in,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.600]   and they being KBR Halliburton, they imported workers in from places like Nepal and Sri Lanka
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   and the Philippines to come in and cook food and work at this dining facility. I got curious about
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   how much it cost us as taxpayers. And so I started asking around some of the people,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.920]   and I think at that time it was like, "Well, every time a soldier or a service member walks
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.200]   through the door, if I were to go in for breakfast and grab a banana and walk out,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.880]   that's an automatic $35 per head, per meal, four times a day, thousands and thousands of people."
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.240]   And then we made friends. There's a pretty large Filipino community in Hawaii,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.760]   a lot of Filipino soldiers from Hawaii. We made friends with the Filipino workers who were there.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.640]   They would often go in the back of the tents and set up their own rice cookers and cook their own
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.840]   meals, which is where the real good food was. But just started talking to them and getting to know
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   them and ask like, "Hey, how much do you get paid?" And on average, it was like, "Oh, I get paid like
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   500 bucks a month. 500 bucks a month to go and do this work of either cleaning out porta-potties,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.240]   picking up trash, the dining facility, doing laundry, all of these different tasks,"
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.480]   because the military wanted soldiers to be out doing things that only soldiers could do.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.680]   Understandable. But when I started putting two and two together and knowing that this company,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.360]   one company alone, was making trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars, and yet this
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.640]   Filipino mom is making 500 bucks a month, maybe getting one day off a week,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.960]   maybe working 12 hours a day otherwise. I said, "How often are you able to go home to your family?"
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.240]   "Well, they'll let us go home a couple of weeks every other year." It was an eye-opening experience
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:36.000]   that growing up in Hawaii, I frankly hadn't given much thought to before. But it's what led me
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   ultimately coming back from that first deployment. There was no way that I could go back to the life
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   that I had left behind. And I knew somehow, someway, I needed to find a way to use those
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:58.720]   experiences to try to make a positive impact, to try to influence those, frankly, the politicians
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.280]   who were making decisions to go and launch these regime change wars and send our men and women in
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.880]   uniform into war. And to what end, ultimately? - If we can just go back to that list.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.800]   - Yeah. - So the list is just
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.280]   name and injury, name and injury. - Name, unit, potentially location,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.320]   if someone had documented that, and their injury. - And it's just pages and pages of that.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:34.800]   - Yeah, yeah. And I knew, I didn't get to call home every day, but when I called home and talked
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   to my parents, I felt the tension in their voice. And they didn't want me to worry about anything at
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.480]   home, and so they were always like, "Hey, how are you? What can we send you?" And this and that.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.800]   But it wasn't like I was calling them from down the street and saying, "Hey, how's it going? Let's
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:03.360]   go have lunch," or whatever. And so I knew that the reason for that tension was they were terrified
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.840]   of getting a phone call delivering the worst possible news. And that was what I thought of
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:17.760]   as I went through that list of how it is the reality of war. Behind every one of those names
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:26.880]   on that list was a husband or a wife, parents, sons and daughters, family members, who had no
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.240]   idea what we were dealing with, really. All they knew was what they saw on the news. And what my
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.960]   dad told me later when I got home after that deployment was that every time they saw the news
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:49.200]   and they saw a helicopter shot down or crashed or some IED, they held their breath until they saw
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.600]   or heard the news of who it was or what it was. What can you say about what the soldiers had to
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:05.280]   go through physically and psychologically when they get injured? The physical, I mean, some
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:13.440]   injuries appeared to be minor up front. At that time, traumatic brain injury was not something
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:22.960]   that was talked about much, if at all. And so many had visible wounds. Others are now what we know
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:30.080]   appeared like, "All right, cool, you checked out," but had invisible wounds. Those who were injured
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:37.280]   in a way that did not allow them to get back to work found it emotionally very difficult
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   to be put on a plane and evacuated out of there, feeling guilty that they were leaving their
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:53.120]   friends behind and not thinking about themselves or not feeling bad for themselves, but instead
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   feeling bad for being forced to be in a position to leave. For soldiers, of course, we all have
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.480]   our own political opinions on things, but when it comes right down to it in a war zone, it's about
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.800]   your friends. It's about your brothers and sisters that you're serving alongside. It's not about the
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:22.000]   politicians or whatever insanity is going on in Washington. It's about getting up and going out,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.560]   getting the job done, and coming back home together. I had friends of mine who were from
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.840]   Hawaii, who were from American Samoa, very culturally tight-knit community, who confided
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:42.240]   in me throughout that year that we were there. Some of the infantry soldiers who were going out
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:51.280]   on security patrols and doing raids every day, just some of the very traumatic experiences
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:11:01.680]   that they went through, no physical injury, but creating a kind of emotional stress and trauma
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   that as human beings they were struggling in dealing with.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.840]   On a positive note, Polynesian culture especially, but also Asian culture and other cultures around
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.640]   the world, our guys found that shortly after we got there, the unit that we were replacing,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.440]   we're taking the guys out on patrol and saying, "Hey, here's this village. Here's where we found
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.840]   friendlies, or here's where we know that there are insurgents operating, and they've got
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.800]   allies and lookouts," and showing them the lay of the land, basically. What our guys found
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.440]   was that as they were doing these ride-alongs, they call it a left seat, right seat when you're
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:50.960]   coming in and taking over, that there was a bit of a tense, even adversarial type of relationship
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.880]   where on the military side there was an assumption of suspicion or lack of trust,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.360]   just with the local Iraqi people who lived around the base that we were at.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.120]   Without anybody telling them to culturally, our guys began trying to build relationships.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:22.080]   For Hawaii and Samoa, and we had soldiers from Guam and Saipan, little things like you're riding
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.680]   down in a Humvee, you've got a gunner in the turret with a .50 cal or a machine gun of some
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   sort, little things like pointing the muzzle to the sky as you're riding through a town rather
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.000]   than pointing it directly at where people are walking down the street was a huge gesture of
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.320]   an assumption of, "Hey, let's actually talk and become friends." We had our guys riding down the
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.800]   street and throwing shakas out to the local people there, breaking bread, sharing tea,
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.520]   and building those relationships. Again, I served in a medical unit, and what we saw was
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:06.720]   a downward shift in casualties from the unit that had been there before us simply because of that
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.120]   basic human connection that our guys sought to make, and then gradually finding like, "Hey,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.240]   local people who lived in the town right next to us are saying, 'Hey, you guys should really...'"
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.400]   Somebody was digging a big hole a mile down the road. You might want to bypass that or check that
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.440]   out and finding weapons caches and IEDs, improvised explosive devices, and other things
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:38.000]   that helped save people's lives. On the cost side of things, how is it possible for a company like
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.320]   Halliburton or others to get away with $40 bananas or however much it was, so the overhead costs?
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:52.240]   Look, what they will claim is that it's expensive to move logistics through a country at war,
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:03.120]   but they get away with it ultimately, this insane war profiteering, and they're not alone.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   Obviously, there are other companies that this is their business model. They get away with it
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   because of their political connections and the lobbyists that they have, the relationships they
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.560]   have with politicians, and ultimately what President Eisenhower warned against with regard
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.520]   to that cozy relationship between Congress and even what he called then the military-industrial
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.320]   complex. It's been alive and well. He warned us against it, and I would say it's thriving
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:41.680]   more now than ever before. How powerful is the military-industrial complex as a thing?
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.640]   Is it a machine that can be slowed down, can be stopped, can be reversed?
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.840]   It can be. It's powerful. I don't think you can overstate the powerful nature of it
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:01.440]   because it extends so deeply within our government. It's not just those in these
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   specific big defense contracting companies that benefit from it. You look at the revolving door
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.280]   within the Pentagon, for example, where you have both high-ranking people who wear military
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:20.880]   uniforms as well as those who serve as high-ranking Department of Defense civilians who are literally
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.520]   working their way into a big payout when they leave that job. We see it with our own Secretary
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:35.200]   of Defense now. He retired as a general officer, went and served on one of the boards for one of
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.280]   the big defense contractors, and then now back as the Secretary of Defense. We see the same thing in
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.600]   Congress with members of Congress and senior professional staffers in Congress. Same exact
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.160]   revolving door where you have people, whether they're writing contracts for the Department of
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.600]   Defense for the company that then wins the bid for that contract and then going and working for
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   that company, or those in Congress who are writing policies and doing exactly the same thing.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.720]   You have been both a war hawk and a war dove
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.400]   at times. What is your philosophy on when war is justified and when it is not?
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.200]   War is justified when it is in the best interest of our national security
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:31.520]   and when it is the last resort, when all diplomatic efforts have been completed and exhausted
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.960]   and war is the last possible route that must be taken to ensure the safety, security,
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.920]   and freedom of the American people. That's a high-level, beautiful idea,
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:51.360]   but there's messy details. Terrorism, for example. Yes. The United States' involvement in the war in
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:17:01.200]   Iraq and Afghanistan was in part the big umbrella of the war on terrorism. When you decide whether
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   something's justified or not and whether something can be defeated or not, how hard is it? Is it even
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:16.080]   possible? To what degree is it possible to defeat terrorism? Well, first of all, part of the problem
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:24.320]   of our foreign policy has been how many conflicts, wars, military actions have been waged in the name
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:30.800]   of this quote-unquote war on terrorism, in the name of national security. Legislation like the
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.440]   Patriot Act that violates civil liberties, our civil liberties and freedoms in the name of the
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:42.800]   war on terrorism and national security when it's not justified. And so I'll use Afghanistan as an
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:50.240]   example. I support the initial mission that lifted off shortly after the attack on 9/11,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:59.360]   the Islamist terrorist attack on 9/11. It was a relatively small group of U.S. military launched
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   to go after those al-Qaeda cells and Osama bin Laden in the wake of that attack.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.120]   That is the mission that should have been supported and focused on in its execution.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:20.720]   Instead, as you know, attention was diverted very quickly to the regime change war in Iraq
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:29.360]   that was waged on false pretenses and the resources and focus was taken away from that initial
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:38.560]   mission that went to Afghanistan. And the war in Afghanistan blew up into something that became
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:46.000]   about regime change and governance and the Taliban and less focus on al-Qaeda and Osama
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.160]   bin Laden. And it became this thing that even general officers had a hard time
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:57.440]   articulating. What is the objective here? What are we trying to accomplish? What does winning
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:06.000]   look like? At what point do we know it's time to exit and get out? And as you look at things like
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.440]   the Afghanistan files and others, the answers to these simple and essential questions shifted and
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:22.400]   changed over time, over a very long time. Similarly, in Iraq. I bought into a lot of
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.920]   what was being sold by the administration and by Democrats and Republicans and Congress at the time,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.520]   and very quickly, even as I was on the ground there, started to have my eyes opened up into
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:42.160]   how we had been lied to tremendously and how that protracted war went on for a very,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.720]   very long time with decisions being made that ultimately served to strengthen
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:54.400]   terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, the creation of ISIS, and others, really undermining our
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.320]   national security interests in the meantime. Understanding the enemy that you are trying to
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:10.240]   defeat is essential to being able to build a strategy. The declaration of President Biden,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.320]   for example, saying, "Well, the war on terror is over. The war on terror is over." What does
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:23.360]   that mean? Or, "The forever wars are over." What does that actually mean? I served on my last,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:31.040]   most recent deployment in 2021 to East Africa and Somalia, where al-Shabaab is one of those
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.800]   Islamist terrorist groups that follows the same ideology as al-Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, and others.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.120]   This group has been allowed to grow and be strengthened, even though they are one of
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.120]   the main groups that provides funding to al-Qaeda in that entire region. So, any president or
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:58.160]   politician can declare a war to be over. But when you have an enemy like these Islamist terrorist
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:05.920]   groups who are still intent on their goal and their objective, which is to ultimately establish
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:14.080]   their Islamic caliphate and destroy Israel and exterminate the Jewish people and basically
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.960]   kill or convert anyone who doesn't adhere to their ideology, that continues on.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.560]   They will only become stronger the longer our leaders put their heads in the sand and pretend
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.960]   like, "Oh no, this doesn't exist." This kind of war, this war specifically, is one that has to
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:39.200]   be waged militarily and ideologically. And the ideological component to this, which is defeating
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.480]   their ideology with a superior one, is one that I pointed out in Congress during the Obama
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:53.760]   administration. We, the collective, we were failing at. The Obama administration was failing
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.120]   at because they were so afraid of being labeled Islamophobes that they refused to accurately
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.800]   identify the ideology driving these terrorist groups and instead said, "Oh, we are countering
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.200]   violent extremism," was the term that the Obama administration started to use and was coined and
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.160]   kind of mandated across the U.S. government. Well, you have to know, again, you have to know the
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.200]   enemy that threatens you and why they're doing what they're doing if you have any hope of actually
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:30.480]   preventing their attack, both militarily and as we're seeing now with Hamas's actions,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:38.480]   not only directly in the assault on Israel, but how they, Hamas, achieved their objectives
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:45.920]   in spreading their ideology around the world. If you look at the lessons learned from
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:53.840]   the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, how do you fight terrorism? Clearly understanding
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.680]   who they are and where they are and why they're doing what they're doing is essential, first of
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.640]   all. And obviously there are different groups, different names. They have morphed and changed
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:13.360]   based on their locale and how they operate, building relationships with people in other
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.920]   countries, both state leaders as well as religious leaders and others who share that same objective
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.040]   of defeating these Islamist terrorists on both fronts and acting as a united front
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:34.480]   in taking that action. What exactly that action looks like, details on the ground dictate that,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:39.200]   details about these different groups will dictate that. But we've seen examples of this before,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:46.480]   and I saw this in Somalia. We saw it in some cases in Iraq where, for example, you have
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:54.080]   imams who recognize the threat that these terrorist groups pose to their own people
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:02.880]   and their own communities and exerting their influence in defeating the terrorist Islamist
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:10.000]   ideology with their own teachings of Islam and preaching peace amongst their people.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:18.720]   War is ugly and it is messy. It is also an unfortunate reality of the world we live in.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:29.120]   So while I firmly believe that we must always pursue peace, I'm not a pacifist, I'm a realist,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   and recognize that where there are these threats, we must do what we can to work towards that safety,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.560]   that security, that freedom and peace that we all want. If we look at the perspective of Israel
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:56.800]   in the Israel-Gaza war going on now, what do you do with the fact that the death of a civilian
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:07.920]   serves as a catalyst, gives birth to hate, potentially generational hate? So in Israel's
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:16.320]   stated goal of destroying Hamas, they are creating immeasurable hate. What do you do with that?
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.200]   From a perspective of Israel, what is the correct action to take in response to October 7th?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.480]   It's a complex question with a complex answer. I think Israel's approach
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:36.160]   has to be in recognizing that delineation as far as possible. And I know it's tough when you have
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:45.280]   a terrorist group like Hamas that is so interwoven within the community of people
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:53.440]   in Gaza, but to recognize that there should be and there is a shared purpose there for the
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:01.200]   Palestinian people to be able to live free and in peace and not under the oppression of this
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.000]   terrorist group, just as the people of Israel would like to live in peace and free from the
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.960]   threat of attack from a terrorist group that wants to exterminate them. The complexities of what's
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.760]   going on in Israeli politics is, I think, a different conversation, but also one that is
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.560]   directly intertwined with the answer to this question. When you have some people in the
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.640]   Israeli government who don't want the Palestinian people in Gaza at all and want them to go and
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:36.080]   repatriate in other countries, I think that's a big problem. And that further exacerbates
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:45.760]   this hatred and resentment that continues to grow there. This is a generations-long challenge,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:55.040]   unfortunately, of the resentment and tension that exists between many Israelis and many Palestinians
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:04.400]   that can only be resolved when there's strong leadership representing both peoples who are able
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:11.680]   and willing to come together and recognize that the only way forward is to let the past be in the
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:18.640]   past and find a way towards peace in the future. How do you think, how do you hope the war in
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.240]   Ukraine will end? The only way that this war ends is to do exactly what we're talking about.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   There has to be a brokered dialogue and conversation about peace that has to occur
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:43.360]   with representatives from Russia and Ukraine. It is really, truly heartbreaking to see both
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:51.840]   how efforts that began just weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine to do exactly this were thwarted
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:01.120]   by the Biden-Harris administration and other Western powers has cost so many innocent people's
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:08.000]   lives. And this is where I get, I have friends in Ukraine. I've been there more than a few times.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.760]   I've enjoyed and appreciated the time that I've spent there. When I hear from my friends about
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:23.920]   how afraid they are of their husbands being conscripted and feeling like they have to hide
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:30.000]   for fear of being yanked off the streets, their friends and family members who've been killed in
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:39.120]   this war, the only way this ends is when both sides come to the table and find an agreement
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.920]   that neither side is going to be completely happy with, both sides being forced to make some
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:50.080]   concessions, but one where they will both walk away and this war can end.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:56.640]   What's the role of the U.S. President, perhaps, to bring everybody to the table?
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.800]   Do you think that the U.S. President should sit down with Zelensky and Putin together?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:10.720]   Yes. Yes. In an ideal world, yes. This should have happened long ago. The question of whether or not
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:19.200]   President Biden is the right person to do that at this time, when all of the statements and comments
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.920]   that they have made, the Biden-Harris administration has made from the beginning of this war,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:32.160]   essentially point to their objective being to basically destroy Russia. That's one of the
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.720]   reasons why they have supported both the continuation of this war for as long as it's
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:46.640]   lasted, as well as why they have thwarted efforts towards peace. Whoever that most effective,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:55.040]   neutral broker is, that's the best person to do this. The Biden-Harris administration,
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.080]   I think the role that they have to take is actually encouraging Zelensky
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.360]   to sit down and begin this process. Those kinds of engagements are, to me, the most powerful
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:16.640]   exercises of diplomacy that can't be matched, especially when our President's foremost role
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.000]   and responsibility is to serve as Commander-in-Chief. I wish that we had leaders who were
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.200]   more willing to engage because I think we'd make a lot more progress more quickly and to find areas,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:38.240]   both of mutual interest as well as to help de-conflict and de-escalate areas where there
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.440]   is tension or disagreement or adversarial interests. Some of it is basic human camaraderie.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:50.720]   People call me naive for this, but sometimes just knowing that there's a human on the other side,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.480]   even like when it's in private, if you look at Zelensky and Putin, for example,
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:08.560]   just humor. Both are very intelligent, witty, at times even funny people. Yes, this is wartime.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:15.280]   Yes, a lot of civilians and soldiers are dying. There's hate. But if you can look above it all
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:21.040]   and think about the future of the countries, the flourishing of a people, and the stopping
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:27.040]   of the death of civilians and soldiers, then in that place, you can have that basic human
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.160]   connection. I agree. I don't think that's naive at all. And I think there are so many examples
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:42.640]   through history that point to the power of that, the real power in that. In the Cuban Missile
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:49.600]   Crisis, how JFK had to literally find a secret way to communicate with Khrushchev to try to
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:56.240]   go around the backs of the military commanders who were urging him to take military action and instead
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.320]   find, "Hey, we both ultimately want the same thing. Neither of us wants to launch a
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.800]   catastrophic nuclear war, so let's figure this out." Of course, there's examples throughout
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.520]   history. Leaders are complicated people. They're manipulative people. So you have
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.880]   Hitler and Chamberlain meeting and Chamberlain kind of getting hoodwinked by Hitler's charisma
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.000]   and being convinced that Hitler doesn't have any interest in invading and destroying the rest of
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.200]   the world. So you have to- Be smart. Don't be hoodwinked.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.440]   You've met, you've been criticized for this, you've met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   And as part of the campaign, you know, running for president, got criticized for not calling
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.680]   him a war criminal. What's the right way to meet and communicate with these kinds of leaders?
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:56.240]   We, as I just stated, we need leaders who have the courage to meet not just with allies but
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:04.320]   with adversaries in the pursuit of peace, in the pursuit of increased understanding.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:12.560]   If policies are being made through the lenses and the barriers of bureaucrats
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:19.040]   and the media and others who have or may have their own interests,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.080]   our president, a leader, can't make, even members of Congress, can't make decisions
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:33.920]   with the kind of clarity that we, the American people, need them to make. I think that these
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.120]   kinds of engagements are weaponized and politicized, as they were against me,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:49.440]   by those who have their own interests, whether it be the military-industrial complex or
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.640]   in Washington. If you're not part of the official narrative of the U.S. government,
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:05.360]   which was intent on a regime change war in Syria, then you're an outcast. And
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:17.120]   it was unfortunate because, you know, people levied all kinds of accusations and, you know,
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:24.400]   smears against me for going and having the audacity to go and learn more, try to seek the truth,
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:32.000]   in the hopes of preventing more needless war, and in the hopes of preventing yet another quagmire
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:43.200]   and disastrous war in the Middle East. And simply for going and, yes, meeting with Assad, also
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.840]   meeting with religious leaders in Syria, also meeting and talking with people on the streets
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.640]   of Damascus, talking with college students, talking with people from the opposition party
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   who would like to see Assad replaced, you know, talking with a whole host of people over the
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:09.200]   course of a few days. You know, the accusation was levied like, "Oh, she loves dictators."
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.440]   It's a sad state of affairs when some of the most influential voices in our country
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:23.520]   will label someone a lover or supporter of dictators simply because you're saying, "Hey,
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.400]   we shouldn't be going to war. There is another way." And I'm not alone in this. You know,
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:39.280]   people who were against the war in Iraq were given similar labels until it became, you know,
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.240]   popular in our politics to have been against the Iraq War. We see the same thing now with people
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.800]   like Tucker, myself, and others who are saying, "We should not be waging this proxy war against
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.000]   Russia via Ukraine and using the Ukrainian people's lives in this war." Well, now all
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.560]   of a sudden, you're a Putin lover, a Putin puppet, or whatever, you know, the traitor,
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.280]   treason, all of these accusations that are used ultimately by people who are not interested in
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:14.400]   having a substantive conversation about the truth, about looking at these wars and conflicts,
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:20.880]   you know, with a comprehensive view on exactly all the dynamics that are at play. And that's
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   what I found when I came back. I went to Syria looking forward to coming back and shedding light
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:33.680]   on different perspectives, experiences, and stories that I found that would give people a
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:42.000]   more broad understanding of what was happening in that country. And what I found was there was
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.760]   zero interest in the mainstream media or in Congress in hearing any other perspective other
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.000]   than their own, which was, "We need to launch this regime change war through the use of arming and
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.080]   equipping known terrorists within Syria to overthrow the regime," without any idea, without
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:11.920]   them stating any realistic idea of who would take control once Assad was overthrown. But the reality
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:17.440]   actually being that no matter which opposition group they might try to prop up, they would not
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:24.960]   have the power to withstand the terrorist groups whose stated goal it was to go and take over power
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:33.040]   from Assad. They had no interest in trying to gain true understanding. And it was very
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.560]   disheartening. It was very disheartening, and a big lesson learned about where their interests
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:45.840]   really were focused. Yeah, it's a simplistic narrative template that's fit into every single
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:52.800]   situation. A lot of stuff is not talked about in the Russia-Ukraine war. One of the things that's
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.000]   not talked about is, "Okay, so Putin is overthrown, then who do you think will come into power?"
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.720]   Exactly.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.800]   Now, one of the things I talk about with Aristotle is that Putin, and he gets criticized for this,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   that Putin, out of all the people that might take power, is the most liberal, is the most
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:19.520]   dovish. In fact, every indication shows that he really hates this war. And so everybody that
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:28.000]   will step in, if he steps down, or if he is overthrown, is just going to accelerate this war
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.520]   and the expansionism and the thirst for empire and all that kind of stuff that the U.S. military
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:41.120]   industrial complex will feed into. So you have to think about what the future holds and what
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:49.360]   the different power players are, and what the level of corruption there is, and the realistic
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.960]   view of the situation versus the idealistic view of the situation.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:58.720]   Just on that note real quick, I think that was exposed in broad daylight when it appeared that
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:05.040]   the former head of the Wagner Group was about to try to launch a coup, and how that was
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:14.640]   so celebrated, even on MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and others touting that this was somehow going
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:20.000]   to be a great thing without looking at who is this guy really, what has he been doing
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.080]   in different countries around the world, and what would be his ruling philosophy and how that would
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:34.560]   differ or benefit American interests or the interest of security and peace.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.880]   But also the interest of Ukraine and Russia and humanity overall, just the flourishing of nations,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:47.440]   which is great for everybody, and collaborations with nations. Friendly competition. One of the
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.840]   things I love about the 20th century is the friendly, sometimes not so friendly, competition
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.200]   between the Soviet Union and the United States in space, in the space race. It's created some
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.400]   incredible engineering and scientific breakthroughs and all of this, and also made people dream about
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:09.200]   reaching out to the stars. War destroys all of that, or damages it, hopefully just damages it.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.920]   Hopefully the phoenix will rise again. Well, let me ask you about the criticism you've mentioned.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.960]   It's probably the most common criticism of you, that you love Putin.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.480]   So just to linger on it, what do you think is the foundation of this criticism?
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:38.480]   Well, I'll tell you when it began. My first day in Congress was January 3rd,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:44.720]   2013. I believe it was the 3rd, 4th, 5th, somewhere around there. And my last day was January 3rd,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:54.560]   2021. I had been given my experience of serving as a soldier in the Middle East, and
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.880]   the motivation that really drove me to run for Congress in the first place. I served on the
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.960]   Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee for almost eight years, the eight years
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:12.480]   that I was there, with my drive and motivation to actually be in a position to challenge the
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.920]   influence of the military-industrial complex, to try to prevent us from needlessly going to war.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:26.400]   And so, you know, the likes of Hillary Clinton and the cabal of warmongers in Washington,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.240]   they weren't fans of mine, to say the least. I can't say it was a total surprise,
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.360]   but it was disheartening nonetheless, that the very day that I announced my candidacy,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.680]   that I was running for president, which was in February 2019,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.200]   the hour that I walked up onto that stage to announce my candidacy, it was in Hawaii,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:55.920]   and I gave my announcement speech, NBC News published a hit piece that planted the seeds
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:04.400]   of suspicion in voters' minds that somehow I was a darling of Putin and Russia and whatever. It was
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:13.200]   baseless, all of it baseless. And that continued like a steady drumbeat throughout my candidacy,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.840]   but that really was escalated when, in a podcast with David Axelrod, Hillary Clinton said, "Oh,
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   well, the Russians are grooming her." And this is not -- I mean, this came from a very influential
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.480]   person. She was the former Secretary of State, former U.S. Senator, former First Lady, someone
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:41.520]   who wielded and continues to wield a lot of power in the Democratic Party and amongst voters.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:51.120]   And that took it to a whole new level. What is the basis for this? Nothing. It is a tired
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:58.160]   yet dependable playbook that is used not only by people like Hillary Clinton, but also people like
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:08.880]   Mitt Romney and others to try to smear, discredit, and destroy the reputations of people who have the
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:19.920]   audacity to question their objectives as they call for one war or another, or have the audacity to
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:26.880]   say that this is not in the best interest of peace or in our country and our national security.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:35.280]   They keep going back to this playbook, as they do today, because, again, they're not willing to
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:40.720]   debate the substance of one position versus another, which is what we should have. If people
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:46.160]   feel so strong that we should be going and waging this war or that war, okay, great. Go make your
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.280]   case to the American people. Go stand on the floor of the United States House and actually have this
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:57.600]   debate. Allow those who are saying, "No, this is not a good idea," to also stand freely and make
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:07.040]   that argument. Instead, they resort to the kind of name-calling that tells voters, "Hey, you can't
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:14.000]   trust this person or anything that they say." Myself and some of my other colleagues got the
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.040]   same treatment when we tried to pass legislation in Congress that would have taken out provisions
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.240]   from the Patriot Act that are most egregiously violating our Fourth Amendment rights and civil
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.920]   liberties, authorities that have allowed our government to illegally surveil Americans without
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:39.280]   a warrant. As we did so, we're called traitors. We had other members of Congress on the House
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.120]   floor saying that, "If you pass this legislation, you will be responsible for another 9/11-style
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:53.920]   attack on our soil." These are all distraction tactics to try to divert our attention away from
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.520]   what's actually happening and instead just tell voters, "Hey, you can't trust these people."
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.040]   Obviously, this has happened to Trump. It's happened to Bobby Kennedy. It's happened to
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   people like Rand Paul and others. There's a small group, but a growing number,
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.600]   at least on the Republican side at this point, people who are actually willing to stand up and
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:21.440]   challenge the military-industrial complex, challenge the warmongers in both parties.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.800]   Well, people on the left have challenged the warmongers as well throughout the last few decades.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:34.640]   Less so recently. I agree with you, but less so recently. This is one of the reasons why I left
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:45.440]   the Democratic Party, one of the foremost reasons. I devote an entire chapter to this issue in my
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:52.720]   book, For Love of Country, Leave the Democrat Party Behind, going into the detail of some of
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.960]   the things we've talked about, about my own experiences, about what I have learned along
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:04.640]   the way, but also how even in the last year or two years, certainly under this administration,
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:10.400]   people who I worked with in Congress who were Democrats, dependable voices for civil liberties,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:18.240]   dependable voices speaking out against the insanity of people who wanted to wage war for
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:28.080]   the sake of war, they're largely silent now. Unfortunately, within the Democratic Party in
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:36.240]   Washington, there is no room for debate. If you challenge the Biden administration's position on
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:44.960]   foreign policy, you're gonna hear about it, and what we have seen is that that's exactly what's
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:51.120]   happened, and people have retracted statements or just fallen silent, or whatever the case may be.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.800]   This debate that should be existent within both parties on the Democrat side, unfortunately,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:03.440]   it just doesn't exist anymore. There seems to be some kind of
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:10.960]   mass hysteria over the war in Ukraine. It was strange to watch that the nuance aspect of the
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:20.880]   discussion was lost very quickly. It was Putin bad. It was a war between good and evil, and in
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:27.520]   that, if you bring up any kind of nuanced discussion of how do we actually achieve peace in this
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:35.280]   situation, you're immediately put on the side of evil. Yeah, which is pretty sick when you think
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.960]   about it. I mean, it's, you know, the cynical view is, of course, it's the military industrial
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.280]   complex machine. The war profiteers just driving this kind of conversation. Yeah. You know, I hope
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.160]   that's not, I hope they don't have that much power. I hope they just have incentives, and they
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:57.280]   push people, and they kind of use people's natural desire to divide the world into good and evil,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:04.400]   and fight for the side of good. You know, people just have a natural proclivity for that,
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:09.200]   and that's a good thing, that we want to fight for the side of good, but then that gets captured.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:18.320]   And manipulated. Yeah. Yes. I admire your hopefulness. I am hopeful, also,
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:26.800]   because of the goodness in people, and the naturally compassionate nature of people.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:34.720]   However, I will tell you from firsthand experience that what we talk about is the
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:40.960]   national security state, and the military industrial complex, this cabal of warmongers
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:48.880]   that extends not only within government, but outside of government, extends to many powerful
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:49:00.400]   media outlets. They are incredibly powerful, and don't have any qualms at destroying those who try
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.640]   to get in the way of their power. And they've got a lot of tools. They've got a lot of tools to do
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:12.400]   that, which I think is why President Eisenhower chose to include this in his farewell address,
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:22.720]   as a warning, because the only recourse, the only real power that has the ability to destroy them,
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:29.680]   and stand up against them, is a free people, living in a free society, exercising the rights
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:35.040]   that we have enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I just talked to Annie Jacobs,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.840]   and she wrote a book on nuclear war, a scenario of how a nuclear war will happen second by second,
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:49.120]   minute by minute. I apologize. If it happens, how it would happen. It's terrifying. It's terrifying
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.400]   how easy it is to start, that one person could start it, first of all, and then there's no way
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:04.160]   to stop it. Even potentially with tactical nuclear weapons. The machinery of it, how
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:10.320]   clueless everybody is, combined with the machinery of it, it's just impossible to stop. And it's just
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:17.680]   between rushing the United States especially, and then all of a sudden you have nuclear winter and
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:25.520]   five billion people are dead. And they die through just essentially torture, slowly.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:31.840]   How do we avoid that? How do we avoid a nuclear war? That's something that you talk about and
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.360]   think about. How do we avoid this kind of escalation of a hot war?
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.480]   I think the most essential thing, first of all, is
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:54.880]   understanding exactly what you have just detailed. We are in this very strange and absurd time where
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:01.840]   we have talking heads and so-called pundits on TV, we have politicians, we have people who
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:12.800]   are talking about a nuclear war as though it is a war that can be won, period, and a war that
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:22.640]   can be waged somehow without that risk of escalation to the point of destruction of
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:31.520]   human civilization. And so they talk about this as though it's just another war, and especially
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.760]   as they talk about the use of tactical nuclear weapons. "Oh, well, this is small and we think
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:44.400]   it'll send a message without actually escalating to the point where we're dealing with the kind of
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:52.960]   destruction that we witnessed in World War II." That's a dangerous thing when it becomes
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:52:00.800]   normalized as, "Well, we've got this new missile that'll go, and it's targeted, and it's strategic,
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:09.360]   and it'll only harm this 'military target.'" Ronald Reagan was 100% correct when he said,
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.840]   "A nuclear war cannot be won and should never be waged." It was true then, and it's true now,
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.440]   no matter how much these guys who are producing these weapons or those who are benefiting from
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:29.200]   that industry try to tell us, "Oh, no, it'll never happen." So to me, that's an important
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:38.320]   first step to continue to inform and educate and sound the alarms to people, "Don't buy this crap
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:44.720]   because it's not true." And I look forward to listening to your podcast, but the PSA that was
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.160]   put out by New York City's emergency management office about what to do in the event of a nuclear
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:56.960]   attack, you would find it funny if it wasn't so deeply disturbing. How they created this public
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.360]   service announcement, they distributed it everywhere across the city, on the internet,
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:09.760]   I think it was on the radio, where you had a woman who appeared to be an actor coming in and saying,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:19.600]   "Hey, in the event of when the big one hits, here's what you should do. Focus on doing these
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.760]   three things." And I'm paraphrasing, but I encourage you to watch it. I'm paraphrasing,
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:36.240]   but she said, "Get inside, stay inside, and stay tuned." That was it. And you know, "Get inside,
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:42.160]   go away from the windows. Stay inside, don't go outside until you get the all clear. And stay
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:51.040]   tuned. Follow our account on Instagram and Twitter." And at the very end of this short PSA,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:54:01.600]   she said, her closing words were, "We've got this." And it was so disturbing in that
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:09.360]   it was so completely out of touch with reality. It creates this kind of false sense of security
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:15.200]   that, okay, well, it's kind of like, here's what you do when a tornado hits or when a big storm
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   hits, and categorizing the big one, a nuclear attack, within that same kind of preparedness
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:28.560]   that you would want people to have in the event of a natural disaster of some sort.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:37.440]   And it is reflective of the carelessness with which people in our government,
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:44.160]   that careless attitude that people in our government have towards nuclear war and a
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:52.320]   nuclear attack, even as they set us up for failure in pushing us closer and closer to the brink of a
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:58.720]   nuclear war occurring, whether it be an intentional attack or, as we saw during the last Cold War,
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:10.320]   one that could be launched unintentionally. How many near misses were there during the last Cold
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:16.960]   War? I saw this documentary called The Man Who Saved the World, and it was some mid-level
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:24.800]   officer who happened to be on duty and who didn't do what he was told in launching the nuclear
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.280]   missiles because of what they thought was an incoming attack. And it turned out to be a
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.840]   complete mistake or misread on the radar, but that's what we're facing.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.800]   But by the way, there's so many things to say there, but one of the things that
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:44.240]   Annie Jacobson details is just how organized the machinery of all of this is, where the humans
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:51.840]   involved don't have to think. They just follow orders. There's a very clear set of steps you
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.560]   take, and there's very few places where you can inject your humanity and be like, "Wait a minute,
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:04.400]   what's the big picture of this?" The only person that can think is the President of the United
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:10.800]   States. The President of the United States gets six minutes after the warning. The early warning
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:17.200]   system says, whether it's false or not, says that we believe that there's been a nuclear
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:26.720]   weapon launched. You have six minutes before you can make the decision of launch back, initiate.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:38.320]   And to me, that's what I'm voting based on in the current situation. You really have to see that as
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:44.160]   one of the most important aspects of the United States President, is who do you trust in those
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:53.520]   six minutes to sit there? And I'm not really sure, looking at Biden and Trump. Boy, I don't know,
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:00.880]   but I do know that I would like somebody who is thinking independently, and not part of the
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:11.360]   machinery of warmongers. I don't want to make it sound cynical or dramatic, but sometimes in such
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:17.760]   scary situations, in such dramatic situations, you kind of follow the momentum. When the right
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:24.400]   thing to do, the right thing for a leader to do, is to step back and look of all of human history,
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:33.200]   and ignore all the people in the room that are saying stuff. Because most likely what they're
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:40.480]   going to be saying is warmongery type of things. That's one of the things why I also get criticized
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.240]   for. I still think Zelensky is a hero for staying in Kiev. Everybody was telling him to flee.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:54.800]   It was all the information was telling, basically saying the world's second biggest military is like
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:03.280]   coming at Kiev. It's just dumb on all fronts to stay in Kiev. But that's what a great leader does,
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:09.840]   is ignores everybody and stays. Screw it. I'm going to die for my country. I'm going to die
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.400]   as a leader. And that's the right thing for a leader to do.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:21.040]   It's sad that... To me, that's what we should expect of our leaders, is exactly that. And it's
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:29.520]   sad that having a leader in that position fulfill their responsibility and the oath that they take
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:40.800]   is seen as a heroic act. That's your job. That's what we elect our leaders to do. And yet,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:52.320]   so many have failed. But to your point, it's not cynical at all to know that in those rooms,
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:59.280]   especially in these moments of crisis, unfortunately, the predominant and prevailing
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:08.400]   opinion of this warmongering establishment that's not specific to one party is the knee-jerk
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:21.440]   reaction, which is to go to war or to execute an act of war. And this is one of the biggest costs
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:29.200]   of this establishment, destroying the reputations of and smearing and trying to cancel and censor
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:35.280]   those who are voices of peace, or just those who take a contrarian position and say, "Well, hey,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.960]   why don't we just pause for a moment and actually think this through? Why don't we talk through
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:45.680]   what happens if we take this course of action? What happens if we go down a different path?
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:52.400]   Let's actually be thoughtful about what our options are for A, B, and C, and then make the
[00:59:52.400 --> 01:00:00.640]   decision in a thoughtful manner based on that." Even advocating for that is seen as a kind of
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:10.720]   heresy in the warmongering establishment in Washington. And the cost of their retaliation
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.480]   against those who are reasonable voices, who look at the world as it is, not some fantasy that they
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.600]   wish existed, is in those rooms during those critical moments, people will, even if they know
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:32.800]   in their heart or their mind that this could end really badly, their instinct is to self-censor
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.480]   and not speak up because they don't want to experience the wrath and ire, whether it be
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:45.520]   coming from four-star generals or the secretaries of state or defense or these high-ranking people
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.240]   in positions of power and influence. They don't want to be the one guy in the room who's just
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.960]   like, "Hey, guys, let's just take a breath and actually think this through. What will happen?"
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.280]   Not just in the immediate response of this action that you're advocating for,
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.080]   but what are all of the other people, other actors, stakeholders in the world, how will
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.360]   they respond? And then how will we respond to them? How will they respond to us? Actually go
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:19.840]   through this exercise of, in the military, this is commonly referred to as what are the second,
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.040]   third, fourth order of effects that will occur as a result of pursuing a specific course of action.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.200]   It's weird how difficult it is to be that person in the room.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.960]   It requires courage. Which is sad, but it requires courage.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.680]   But why does it require? Even just to ask, "Okay, we've been in Afghanistan and Iraq
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.960]   for this number of years. What's the exit plan?"
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:50.400]   Just bring that up every day at a meeting. What's the exit plan? It's strange that that gets
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.200]   criticized, the war in Iraq and so on. But I just remember there was this pressure you can't
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.040]   quite criticize or ask dumb questions about, "Wait, what? Why are we going into Iraq again?"
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.800]   They're not dumb questions.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.680]   In retrospect, you're like, "Oh, they're not dumb questions at all." But it actually required a lot
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:13.360]   of courage to ask them while still working within the institution. It's easier if you're an activist
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:19.200]   from the outside saying, "No war," this kind of stuff. But within the institution, in the position
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:27.760]   of power, to ask the questions like, "Maybe let's not." It seems really difficult. The same kind of
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.760]   thing in the war in Ukraine and just any kind of military involvement. Again, I guess the cynical
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:41.680]   interpretation is that it's the military-industrial complex that permeates the halls of power.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.880]   It does. And what is behind the military-industrial complex? And there are different examples of this.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.080]   You can look at the pharmaceutical industry as well. There's a huge amount of money and a huge
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:03:01.120]   amount of power that wields tremendous influence over members of Congress. There are different
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:09.680]   examples of this across different sectors of our society. But I think the military-industrial
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:19.840]   complex over time has proven itself to be the most powerful and influential. And that's what
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:27.520]   is behind it, is this is why they try to destroy anyone who dares to ask the most obvious questions,
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:34.560]   is because it is about power and wielding power. Well, the cool thing about United States
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.600]   presidents, they have the power to say a few to everybody in the room, I think.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.800]   They do. It just seems like
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.000]   they don't quite take that power. People will say, "Yeah, the U.S. president doesn't have that much
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   power." I don't know about that. If you look at the law, especially in military, when you're talking
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:00.320]   about war and the military, they have a lot of power. Yes. So they can fire everybody. They have
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.720]   a lot of power. They can stop wars. They can start wars. They have a lot of power.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.280]   The position of the presidency certainly does. Unfortunately,
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:19.120]   we have people too often who assume the presidency from a position of weakness because they're afraid
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:29.680]   of losing power. And so they make those calculated decisions not based on what is right or for the
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:37.760]   right reasons, but instead driven by fear of loss of power and loss of influence. And that's where,
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:46.880]   especially given all that we are facing, we need leaders in the presidency and in Congress
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.720]   who have courage to be that voice in the room, to ask about,
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.400]   to remain mindful of and rooted in the Constitution. Even as we are seeing this
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   legislation being billed as the anti-TikTok bill, that's really not about TikTok. It's about
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.200]   freedom of speech. Can you actually explain that, Bill?
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.400]   Yes. This is another--I guess the bottom line up front is this is another piece of legislation
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:30.000]   being expedited through Congress with strong bipartisan support
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:39.680]   in the name of national security interests that is essentially a power grab and an assault on
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:48.160]   freedom and liberty. And I'll just say this in, I think, probably like the top three things that
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:55.440]   they're not actually telling us that's in the bill. Freedom of speech. It's our ability to be
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:01.920]   able to express ourselves, whether it be in person, on a podcast, on a social media platform,
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   in a newspaper, whatever the platform may be. This legislation gives the executive the power
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:19.600]   to decide which platforms are acceptable for us to be able to use. TikTok itself--the word TikTok
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:27.920]   is not actually in the bill, but it gives the power to the president to decide who is a foreign
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:34.640]   adversary single-handedly, no consultation with or agreement from members of Congress or anyone
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:41.760]   else. It actually gives the power to a cabinet secretary to designate who is a foreign adversary
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:50.880]   and if a social media platform has at least 20 percent ownership in a social media platform,
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:07:01.760]   that platform may be banned from doing business in America, essentially. But it's not just a
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:07.520]   foreign state actor that could be named as a foreign adversary. It also includes a line in
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:15.520]   the legislation that if, let's say a person has at least 25 percent financial interest or ownership
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:24.000]   in a social media platform, they're an American citizen who may be working or living in some
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.360]   other country, or working or living here but doing business with other countries.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:38.320]   If the executive branch of our government decides that this individual is under the influence of
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:45.760]   or controlled by someone that they deem a foreign adversary, then that platform
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:53.200]   must not do business in America. And that person, obviously, even an American citizen,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:01.440]   is banned from conducting that business. They must divest, essentially.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.880]   So when you look at--and this is where there's been a lot of chat around this--when you look at
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.520]   Elon Musk, for example, well, you already have people in the Biden administration,
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.800]   even President Biden himself, implying that Elon Musk's activities need to be investigated.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.920]   Well, he is someone with Tesla who does business in a lot of countries, including China,
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:28.080]   and therefore he must be investigated. It is not at all a stretch of imagination to say that
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:34.880]   X could be the next platform that the executive branch decides, "Nope, we've designated this
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.840]   person to be a foreign adversary, and therefore his business interest cannot be allowed for this
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.480]   social media platform, cannot be allowed to exist." We've seen this already with people
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:54.320]   accusing him and X of interfering in our elections. Again, it's ironic that it's coming
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:00.720]   from the Democratic Party, that they are claiming that a guy who has said himself he's committed to
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.520]   free speech and is allowing free speech on his platform and is not allowing the federal government
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:15.040]   to manipulate his platform by deeming which accounts are okay to post their content and
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.720]   which accounts are not because of disinformation or whatever they claim it to be. It's not an
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:28.480]   accident that the social media platforms that have been proven to take action at the behest
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.960]   of the federal government and the White House to censor certain voices, they are not included
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:44.240]   with or being targeted at all in this legislation or outside of it. Yet other platforms that are not
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:53.200]   cooperating or collaborating somehow are. So the underlying issue here, this is being sold
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:59.600]   as TikTok and national security, but ultimately, even as Ron Paul said, this is legislation that's
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.000]   the greatest assault on liberty since the Patriot Act was passed. Yeah, it's quite dark that it's
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.680]   just a graph of power. It is. I mean, it's not just with Elon, it's probably with Zuck,
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:20.080]   with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. It puts pressure. It's not just about banning,
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:28.320]   but it puts pressure for them to kind of moderate behavior, which is a slippery slope.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:35.040]   Of course, it's a beautiful dance of power because you don't want tech companies to have too much
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:42.560]   power either, or individuals at the top of those tech companies have too much power. But then do
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.880]   you want that power in the hands of government? No. The history of this nation is a fascinatingly
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:58.080]   effective journey towards the balance of power. And it does seem like this sneaky little thing,
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.360]   as much as I hate TikTok on all fronts, my brain rots every time I use TikTok. I know it's also
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.440]   like the national security dangers of China and so on, but it's just like TikTok, man.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:17.120]   It's so addicting. It's so addicting. So when I first saw this TikTok bill, I was like, "Yes."
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.280]   But then they got me. The Trojan horse got me.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:29.920]   And this is like the Social Dilemma documentary, I think exposed a lot that there is so much
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:40.080]   that these algorithms do in these various social media platforms that's problematic,
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:48.160]   to say the least. Data security and privacy is a serious issue. These are serious things.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:55.760]   And so let's have a conversation about these serious things and cease these attempts to
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:03.120]   have our government try to tell us what we are and aren't allowed to see, where we are and aren't
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:09.120]   allowed to say what we want to say. That's really what it comes down to. Yeah. More and more trust
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.920]   people to, whenever social media companies do bullshitty things, for the people to make
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:21.520]   documentaries about it, to discover it, for great journalists to do great journalism and find the
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:26.640]   flaws and the hypocrisy and the call for transparency, all those kinds of things. I don't
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:33.120]   trust, in most cases, government regulation of technology companies because they seem to be
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.880]   really out of touch. One, they want power. They're really intimidated by the power that the tech
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.800]   companies have. And two, they don't seem to get it, the technology at all. So they're hindering
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.240]   innovation and they're just greedy for power. It's a bad combination. It's a bad combination.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:57.600]   The thing here, too, though, is this extends far beyond social media companies.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.920]   This is a very specific example, but it's one example of many how
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:14.160]   those who are greedy for power are continuing to try to find ways to tell us how to live our lives.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.000]   They're increasingly trying to tell us, again, what we're allowed to see and hear,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.240]   whether it be social media companies or what shows up in a Google search engine, for example.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:35.840]   If they're not finding a willing and compliant social media company or big tech company, then
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.400]   they're looking for ways to reach their hand into those tech companies and force compliance.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:51.760]   In the age of disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, all of the excuses that are given
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:59.280]   for government, either directly or indirectly through big tech, to try to censor certain
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:09.920]   voices, it really undermines the truth, which is the way to defeat bad speech
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.160]   is with better speech and more speech. Whether it's hate speech or things that
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.920]   you might be offended by or things that you might disagree with, the answer is not
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:28.480]   to have some entity with the power of censorship and being the "authority" to decide what is good
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.560]   speech and acceptable and what is bad speech and unacceptable. It's what you said. Let's encourage
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:41.920]   this debate and encourage people who are inspired by, "No, man. I saw this thing or this thing is
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.080]   happening, and it's pissing me off, so I'm going to bring a superior argument. I'm going to show
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:54.800]   what the right way is." Gosh, this is what our founders envisioned for us as a society in this
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:02.080]   country. We would be so much stronger with a more engaged people and a more informed people
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.920]   if we had this and had it supported.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.080]   Do you think, what are the chances that the TikTok ban bill passes?
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.760]   The way that it passed through the House of Representatives with such an overwhelming
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.040]   bipartisan support and so quickly, and President Biden saying that if it comes across his desk,
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:28.960]   he'll sign it, I thought it would pass through very quickly. I'm only slightly encouraged by
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.720]   the fact that the Senate at least appears to be saying, "Hey, there are serious free speech
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.840]   concerns around this bill, serious civil liberties concerns around this bill. We need to do our due
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:48.720]   diligence." I won't say I'm cautiously optimistic because I understand how that place works,
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:56.480]   but their pause at least gives people the opportunity to continue to kind of sound the
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:03.360]   alarm and for people to call their senators and express their concerns with this, that are very
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.800]   real, valid concerns. Yeah, this is really messed up. Just in case we didn't make it clear, I think
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:14.880]   this is a really, really big danger if this thing passes. Even if you hate Elon Musk or whatever,
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.240]   this is really, really, really dangerous. If the government gets say over the platforms
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.440]   on which we communicate with each other, it's a huge problem.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:30.880]   And there's a section in there as well, just kind of the last piece on this is if you use a VPN
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:39.680]   and you try to use a VPN to access this, you could have problems with the law. And you take that a
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:47.120]   step further and say, "Well, how would they know?" There's a surveillance aspect to that. So once you
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:56.000]   start peeling back the layers of this really toxic onion, it really leads seriously to a pretty dark
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:05.200]   and dangerous and oppressive place. You were a longtime Democrat. You were the vice chair of the
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:11.760]   Democratic National Committee until you resigned in 2016 to endorse Bernie. I should say I love
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:19.280]   Bernie. I loved him before he was cool. All right. Anyway, can you go through what happened
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.560]   in that situation? Yeah.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:25.920]   And with the Democratic National Committee and with Bernie and why you resigned?
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:33.280]   As a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, one of the things that the rules of
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:40.080]   the DNC required was that officers of the DNC, of which we were as I think there were five or six
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.320]   of us who were vice chairs at the time, you have to remain neutral in a Democratic primary.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:53.200]   So you're not as a party supposed to be tipping the scales in any direction for any candidate
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:18:06.480]   during a primary election. And so I had no plans to get involved for any candidate or against any
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:09.920]   candidate during that primary in just the hopes of like, all right, we got to make sure that this
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:18.160]   is a fair and balanced primary so that voters have the best opportunity to vote for the candidate of
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:24.400]   their choosing. I saw a couple of things pretty quickly. Number one is that the chair of the DNC
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.720]   at the time was a woman named Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman out of Florida.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:40.880]   And she made very serious decisions unilaterally that many times we found out about via tweet or
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:48.320]   press release that showed she was tilting the scales in the favor of Hillary Clinton in that
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:58.720]   2016 primary. The other thing that I saw was how the mainstream media and those who are supposed
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.400]   to be in a position to be neutral arbiters to facilitate debates and forums and conversations
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:10.800]   so that voters can be best informed in who they want to vote for were calling Hillary Clinton the
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.880]   most qualified person ever to run for president in the history of our country because of the
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.840]   positions that she had held as Secretary of State, as a U.S. Senator, as First Lady.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:29.760]   And yet they glossed over those titles without ever holding her, asking questions even, or holding
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:37.520]   her to account for her record, especially in the area of foreign policy. The job she was running
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:44.880]   for was to be Commander in Chief, to be the President of the United States. That responsibility
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:51.680]   to serve as Commander in Chief is the foremost responsibility a president has. It's essentially
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:20:01.760]   the one area where the president can unilaterally make decisions without education, health care,
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   immigration. Congress has to actually pass legislation. The president can come through
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.000]   and say, "Hey, here's the policies that I want. Here's legislation that I'll propose." But those
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:17.520]   changes can't be made without Congress working with Congress to pass them. So she was essentially
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:23.440]   being let off the hook for her record. As an American, as a soldier, as a veteran,
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.920]   that was a big problem for me. And so I made the decision to resign as Vice Chair of the DNC
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:37.040]   so that I could endorse Bernie Sanders, who largely at heart, I believe, is a non-interventionist.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:46.240]   He hasn't focused a lot on foreign policy. It's not at the heart of what his focus has been for
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:53.760]   decades. But he was certainly far more of a non-interventionist than Hillary Clinton,
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:59.920]   who has shown through her record to be the queen of warmongers in Washington.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:07.920]   I wanted to be in a position where I would have a platform to inform voters
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:13.840]   about her record so that they could make that decision for themselves, so that they could see,
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:20.560]   "Hey, in this area, on this issue, which is incredibly important, there is a clear contrast
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.840]   between these two candidates running in the Democratic primary." And that's what drove my
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:31.760]   decision to resign and to endorse Bernie Sanders. And that's what I went on to do throughout the
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.600]   rest of that primary election. What do you like most about Bernie,
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:43.840]   the positive? You know, what I like most about him is he is who he is, unapologetically so,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:52.640]   both in personality but also in what he advocates for and what he's advocated for for a long time.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:59.760]   So you can agree or disagree with his positions, but he is who he is.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.560]   Like I said, you were a long-time Democrat. You ran for President in 2020 as a Democrat.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:15.360]   Now you're an Independent, and you're in an excellent book describing your journey
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   ideologically, philosophically, through that.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.560]   Why did you choose to leave the Democratic Party?
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:35.840]   In the book, I go into a number of the central reasons why I made that choice. But fundamental
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:45.680]   to them is that the Democratic Party has become a party that is opposed to freedom,
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:53.760]   that is opposed to the central and foundational principles that exist within our founding
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:23:01.040]   documents and that serve as the identity of who we are as Americans and what this
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:10.560]   country is supposed to be about. It has become a party that is controlled by this elitist cabal
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:21.920]   of warmongers who are driving forward this "woke" agenda. And we see it through their
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.000]   racializing of everything. We see this through their "defund the police"
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.720]   mission. We see this through their open border policies. We see this through
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:43.040]   how in their education policy they are failing our kids and how they are pushing
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:50.720]   this narrative that ultimately is a rejection of objective truth.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:59.200]   The fact that it's a question up for debate about whether or not – well,
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.240]   actually, it's not a question up for debate for them. They are actively pushing for
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:17.040]   boys who identify as girls to compete against girls in sports, changing our language so that
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:24.160]   the word "woman," the identity of being a woman, is essentially being erased from our society.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:33.680]   And it is the height of hypocrisy and, frankly, an act of hatred towards women that they are so
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.720]   intent on doing this. And ironic that it's coming from the party that for so long
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:47.600]   proclaimed themselves to be the greatest feminist and the most pro-woman party in the country.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:57.520]   I go into detail around each of these issues and more in the book, but you will see as we
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:02.960]   go through each of these issues, fundamental and foundational to every one of them is that,
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.680]   sadly, the Democratic Party has become a party that is so consumed by their desire for power,
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:20.080]   this insatiable hunger for power, that they are willing to destroy our republic, our democracy,
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:26.080]   our freedom, just so that they can try to hold on to power and gain more power.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:32.000]   So these are just different mechanisms for power. The identity politics and the warmongering are
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.520]   related to each other in that they're mechanisms to attain more power.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:35.760]   Yes.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:42.640]   You know, you're making it sound like only the Democratic Party are full of power-hungry people.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.200]   So to you, you know, the Republican Party, I don't know if you've met those folks,
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:47.920]   but some of them--
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.480]   Couple of them.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.000]   --are also in love with power--
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.240]   Yes.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.320]   --and are, you know, at times, to some degree, politicians in general are corrupt,
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.520]   sometimes within the legal bounds, sometimes slightly outside of the legal bounds.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.760]   And so to you, to what degree is sort of the Democratic Party is worse than the Republican
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.960]   Party? So I don't want to paint a picture of like this kind of beautiful vision of the Republican
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.920]   Party that they're somehow not power-hungry.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:26.240]   Yeah, I'm glad you brought this up. You know, the book details why after 20 or so years,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.080]   as a member of the Democratic Party, I decided to leave.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:37.760]   But also, and it goes through my experiences and things that I have seen and learned along the way,
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:44.720]   but I also point out exactly that fact in the book. But from the very beginning with the prologue is
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.560]   we should not be naive to think that this only exists within the Democratic Party.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.920]   There are very serious problems within both of our political parties,
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:02.880]   specifically coming from politicians who are driven by this desire for power and who are
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.560]   so afraid of losing that power that they're willing to do whatever they feel they need to do,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.560]   which centers around taking away our freedom. Because the more free we are to make our own
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.560]   decisions, even if they may end up being the wrong decisions, but to learn from those things and
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:26.400]   know that we've got to live with the consequences, the beauty and messiness of what a free society
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:33.200]   looks like. They're so afraid of us because they see us as the people and our freedom as
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:40.320]   the central threat to their ability to remain in power. I think the difference that we're seeing
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.960]   today is that unfortunately, we talked about this a little bit, how the Democratic Party
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:55.440]   has become a party where you must walk in lockstep with the leadership of that party or risk
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:04.080]   being faced with your reputation being destroyed and smeared and all of these different attacks.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.560]   And the reason why they do that is to put people like me and Bobby Kennedy and others up as an
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.080]   example of saying, "Hey, if you step out of line, if you challenge us, this is what we're going to
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:22.720]   do to you." The Republican Party has also done that, and they also have politicians and leaders
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:30.080]   who are more interested in feeding the thriving system in the Washington establishment.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:39.200]   But we're also seeing that the Republican Party also has some voices, and I would say increasing
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:46.320]   voices of people, and I would put Donald Trump in this category, who are challenging the "norms"
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:52.400]   of the Republican Party that are represented by people like Nikki Haley or Mike Pence,
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:29:01.280]   for example. The Republican Party is not a monolithic entity, and it means different
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.720]   things to different people. And that's where I think the real challenge in this next election is
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:18.080]   less—it's really less about one political party over another, and it's more about our opportunity
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:27.120]   as voters to select leaders, first of all, to fire those who are against freedom and who are
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:34.080]   warmongers who, by their essence, are willing to take away our freedom in the name of national
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.640]   security and vote for people—nobody's perfect, we shouldn't hold anybody up on a pedestal—but
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:48.000]   vote for those who are committed to the Constitution and who hold those values
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.760]   that represent the interests of the people. I'm not a fan of this choice, but here we are,
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:02.720]   Biden versus Trump. So let me ask you sort of a challenging question of pros and cons.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:08.240]   Can you give me pros and cons of each? What's the biggest strength and biggest limitation of,
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:18.560]   let's say, Biden? This is a tough question. I've known President Biden for a lot of years.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:24.240]   I knew his son, Beau, who served in the National Guard the same time that I did.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:32.000]   I consider Joe Biden a friend. He is someone over the years that I have talked to
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.040]   and shared laughs with and spent time with in different situations.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:44.400]   The positive characteristics that drew me to Joe Biden of the past,
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:51.360]   they are not represented in how he has led as president.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:59.520]   And, you know, I'll let the pundits theorize as to how that is or why that is, but the truth
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:12.720]   that I know exists, which points to his weakness, is that instead of listening to his better angels,
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:21.360]   he has instead at every turn, if you go back and you, you know, I look back to his inauguration
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.480]   speech where he promised to be a president for all Americans. And, you know, during his campaign,
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.880]   promised to be the uniter in chief, to bring a country together that was deeply divided.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:37.840]   That's the Joe Biden that I've known for many years, a guy who has, you know, worked with
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:45.200]   different people with different backgrounds and different political views, but tried to find at
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:54.000]   different points in time a way to work together. At every turn, he has done the exact opposite
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   of what he spoke about during his inauguration speech and has left us as the American people
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:11.440]   today, more divided, less secure, both from an economic standpoint as well as a national security
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:18.080]   or safety and security standpoint, and less free as a society and as a people.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:27.360]   So the biggest criticism would be he divided us or continued the division that's been there. Who
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:34.400]   do you be the greatest uniter? Like to me, over the past few decades, to me, Obama. You've been
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:43.440]   very critical of Obama on the foreign policy side on many fronts. But to me, that guy did really
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:48.800]   good. Maybe some people say just rhetoric, but I think rhetoric matters when you're president.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.120]   I think he was, out of all the presidents we had, is probably the most effective uniter of
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:04.400]   the people. Would that be fair to say? During his 2008 campaign, yes. I think that his message
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:12.480]   resonated with so many people across generations and across, you know, different views, different
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.960]   backgrounds to where, you know, people cried on the night that he was elected because they felt
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:27.840]   so hopeful. I talk to people, and I know people who set aside their entire lives to work on his
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:37.360]   campaign to be a part of this hope and change mission that he laid out that would bring us
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:44.320]   together. You know, some of the people that I know personally, they gave up their lives during
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:49.600]   the campaign, and after he won, they went to Washington, D.C. because they wanted to be able
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:56.160]   to do the work that he had laid out and continue to be a part of this mission that they expected
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:03.760]   would extend beyond the campaign. And they've expressed to me personally how heartbroken they
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:11.600]   were because so quickly after he was elected, instead of bringing in a new generation of fresh
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:18.160]   leadership that was not a part of the Washington establishment, he instead immediately chose to
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:24.640]   surround himself with people who were more of the same old, same old, who were essentially part of
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:38.640]   the problem. And many of his actions after that proved that fear and that broken heartedness that
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:44.000]   they felt to be true. And I'll mention one example related to civil liberties that we
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.880]   talked about. He was someone as a U.S. Senator who gave some pretty powerful speeches on the
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:57.680]   Senate floor about his concerns with the Patriot Act, his concerns with surveillance from the NSA,
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.400]   his concerns with a violation of our Fourth Amendment rights and civil liberties.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.640]   But when as president, he was confronted with leaked information about the surveillance occurring
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:17.360]   under those authorities in his presidency, he sided, he took the side of the national security
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:25.440]   state and did not take action to right the wrongs that he correctly pointed out as senator and
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:31.840]   during his campaign for the presidency, which is unfortunate because he really did build this
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:39.280]   um unifying momentum throughout his campaign. What do you think that is? Why is it so hard
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:46.640]   as a president to kind of act on the promises of the campaign, but also just, I mean, his speech,
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.520]   his basically anti-war speech, that really resonated to me, the fact that he was against
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:57.040]   the war in Iraq, I believe, early on. And that was a huge point of distinction between him and
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:03.920]   Hillary Clinton, probably one of the biggest. Why is it so hard when you step into the office
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:10.880]   of president to sort of act on your ideals? I think it goes back to what we talked about
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.720]   a little bit, which is, you know, what are you driven by and what are you afraid of?
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:23.920]   And if you are concerned for whether or not you can get reelected,
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:34.240]   who's going to fund that reelection effort? Who's going to fund the presidential library
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:42.320]   and your legacy that will follow? There have been some documented examples around how he promised
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:50.320]   to crack down on big pharma, but when push came to shove, his Department of Justice campaign funding
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:58.320]   was threatened and they chose not to take action, even when they had a very, very strong case to
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:07.360]   make. This was with regard to the opioid crisis in the country. And, you know, this just goes back
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:15.280]   to the heart of why it's so essential that we have leaders who have courage and who are focused on
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:25.680]   doing what we elect them to do. Who are resistant to the love of money and power. Yes.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:32.320]   It's hard. And we are human. We are fallible. We are flawed by nature.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:40.320]   And I'll go into kind of the next one you asked about Trump. The weakness side and the lessons
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:49.680]   that I hope have been learned from 2016 for him and his team is you have to be in a position where
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:56.960]   you are surrounding yourselves with other people of courage who aren't just thinking about their
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:03.840]   next political job or their next job getting a cable news contract or looking for fame themselves
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.600]   or looking at how they can monetize their position for whatever their next financial
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:18.000]   interest might be, but people of courage who know what they're up against to really seriously clean
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.520]   house across the federal government and the corruption and rot that is so deeply entrenched
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:34.080]   in order to truly be effective. And if he is reelected, that is my hope that he sees
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.440]   that he's learned from what went wrong in 2016 that, you know, he went in, you know,
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:49.280]   with a largely non-interventionist, more focused on peace agenda. And yet he surrounded himself
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:55.360]   with people who are at the heart of the warmongers in Washington and who directly
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:02.960]   went against the policies that he advocated for. On the strength side, I think it's
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:10.480]   easy to point out because it's also what has caused him to be so
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.120]   attacked in ways that we haven't seen before, certainly not in my lifetime,
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:25.040]   by the Democrats, by the Biden administration, not only in now, but, you know, something that
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:32.720]   started back in 2016 when he was a candidate. He's a guy who, you know, by all measures has
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:39.920]   been successful in his own life. And because of that, he's not coming in with this desire to
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:48.000]   please Washington that many other politicians have. And because he is so willing to challenge
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.560]   the "norms," and these are not norms that serve the interests of the American people. These are
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:01.680]   norms that serve the interests of the most powerful. He is a direct threat. And so that
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:08.800]   attitude and that mindset of not coming in with the kind of caution that too many politicians come
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.640]   in with, of wanting to be the popular one at the parties or whatever it is that they want,
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:23.280]   that is the strength that he brings. Yeah, I just had a conversation with Dana White, and he's good
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:29.760]   friends with Trump, and he talks to the fact that he seems to be resistant to the attacks.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.600]   And some aspect of that is it's just the psychology of being able to withstand the attacks that are
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:43.120]   there in the political game. And that can break people. Like, you just don't want the headaches.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.680]   So to withstand the attacks is tough. And something about his psychology allows
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:53.280]   for that. I mean, I guess a question for you also, in your own psychology,
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:58.080]   you've been attacked quite a bit. We've mentioned some of that, sort of misrepresentations, and
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.440]   how do you deal with that by yourself? Like, how do you not become cynical or
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.200]   overcompensate the other direction, that kind of stuff?
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:16.400]   It really stems from having a clear sense of purpose. I never saw, you know, I've served in
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:21.680]   state government, I've served on our city council in Honolulu, and served in Congress,
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:32.320]   but at no time have I seen this as a "political career." I don't have that
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:40.960]   ladder-climbing ambition that a lot of politicians have. My sense of purpose is deeply rooted in my
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:52.320]   dedication and my desire in my life to be pleasing to God and to live a life of service.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:42:00.160]   And what better way to be pleasing to God than to try to do my best to work for the well-being of
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:08.240]   God's children? Being rooted in that has made it so that as the attacks are coming from different
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:14.720]   directions, even as people who I was friends with, former colleagues of mine, others,
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:22.560]   even family members, even as they have turned away or become attackers against me themselves
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:30.880]   because of different reasons related to politics, of course it's a sad thing, especially when it's
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.120]   someone that, you know, you know personally and have had a personal friendship or relationship
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:46.080]   with, but I don't live my life trying to please politicians or please the people who show up on
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:55.360]   TV or anyone else. As long as I am doing my best to be pleasing to God, that is where I draw my
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.000]   happiness from and my fulfillment and contentment and strength.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.920]   So you've spoken about the value of religious faith in your life, of your Hindu faith, and
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:12.160]   seeing the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritual guide. So what role does faith in God play in your life?
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.840]   It's everything. It is central to who I am, what inspires me, what motivates me,
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:27.920]   where I find strength, where I find peace, where I find shelter, and where I find happiness.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:38.160]   And this has been a constant throughout, you know, times of challenge, times of darkness,
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:50.160]   times of heartbreak, times of happiness, in always feeling very secure in knowing that
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:57.120]   God's unconditional love is ever-present. And no matter what else is happening in my life,
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:07.680]   that God is my best friend, and remaining centered and grounded in always remembering
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:15.280]   that and meditating upon that truth is everything to me.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:23.280]   The interesting thing about the Hindu God is how welcoming the religion is of other religions.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.040]   It's true.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:33.280]   How accepting it is. In that way, in many ways, it's one of the most beautiful religions
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:46.720]   on Earth. So who do you think God is to you? In specifically the texts, but also you personally,
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:59.600]   what does he represent? So for Hinduism, there's also an aspect where it's a part of all of us.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.440]   There's a uniting thing, not a singular figure outside of us.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.560]   I think one of the things that's most commonly misunderstood about Hinduism
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:16.880]   that people don't know is that Hinduism is truly a monotheistic religion; that there is one God,
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.000]   and he goes by many names that describe his different qualities and characteristics.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:32.080]   And as you pointed out, Hinduism is uniquely of a non-sectarian spiritual practice,
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:40.000]   essentially. It's not a "religion" that you convert into or you leave behind or whatever
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:48.800]   the case may be. Bhagavad Gita, a central scripture and text that comes from India,
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:58.400]   literally means "song of God," and the principles that are conveyed throughout the Bhagavad Gita
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:06.640]   are applicable to all of us. They are timeless truths that whether you consider yourself
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:18.720]   Christian or Catholic or Muslim or Jewish or Hindu, these truths are eternal and relevant
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:29.200]   through all time. So for us as kids growing up, we learned from and had bedtime stories that came
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:35.440]   from both the Bhagavad Gita and the New Testament. My dad was raised Catholic, my mom was raised
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:42.400]   Episcopalian, and both of them were attracted to the Bhagavad Gita as they were in their own lives
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:49.920]   searching for a more personal relationship with God than they had been able to find elsewhere
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:47:00.480]   in their own spiritual journeys. And that's where the application of, you know, there are teachings
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:06.320]   in the Bhagavad Gita, for example, that talk about bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga essentially translates
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:16.640]   into dedicating your life, striving to develop a loving relationship with God. Karma-yoga,
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.800]   there's a chapter in the Bhagavad Gita that speaks about karma-yoga. Karma is a word that
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:26.320]   has become a part of the, you know, both karma and yoga have become very common terms,
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:37.520]   but what it really means is trying to dedicate your actions in a way that have a positive impact
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:45.200]   on others, being of service to others. And so for me growing up, I never really understood as a kid
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:51.520]   the idea of sectarianism, of one religion battling against another, because I knew and understood and
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:48:01.200]   experienced that the real meaning of religion was love for God. No matter what name you worship
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:08.880]   him by or how you worship, that is the real meaning of religion. And the application of that
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:19.680]   in your life is, you know, you ask how do I see God in a personal way? I know that God is my best
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:27.920]   friend. God is my confidant. When I am struggling with a problem in my life or, you know, during
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:40.480]   those quiet moments by myself where I am anxious or I'm sad, I turn to God for that solace,
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:49.040]   for that clarity, for that strength to both know what the right thing to do is and the strength
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:58.640]   to act accordingly and to constantly strive to further develop that very personal,
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:04.320]   loving relationship with God. - Tulsi, this is an honor to finally meet you, to talk to you. This
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.720]   was amazing. Thank you. - Thank you, Lex. It's so wonderful to be here. Thank you for the opportunity.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.520]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tulsi Gabbard. To support this podcast,
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:18.960]   please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:27.360]   Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address. "A vital element in keeping the peace is our
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:34.400]   military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action so that no potential
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:41.360]   aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction. American makers of plowshares could
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:48.160]   with time and as required make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.880]   of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent ornaments industry
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:02.320]   of vast proportions. This conjunction of immense military establishment and a large arms industry
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:09.280]   is new in the American experience, yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.960]   In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:20.640]   influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:28.160]   The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.800]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:33.040]   you
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:34.080]   you
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:34.580]   you
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:35.620]   you
