[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.120]   technology law transactions, and litigation since 2008.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:27.720]   Hello, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   In this episode I want to talk about the one cure for staying retired if you retire early.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.640]   Because I've been going through my archives and I stumbled upon a post talking about a
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.040]   master plan to re-retire by September 1st, 2022.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.640]   I made this plan, I wrote this post in January 2020 because I was thinking to myself, well,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.080]   my daughter was just born, I might as well grind, the pandemic hit, there's nowhere to
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.880]   go, might as well make some more money and take care of my family.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.720]   And what I realize now that it's the end of 2023 is that it's very hard to stay retired
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840]   once you retire early.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.960]   And one of the things I didn't realize until after I wrote the post and after I went on
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.880]   a play date and talked to a dad was the power of FOMO and just being in an area where there's
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.740]   so much going on.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.240]   So what is the hot investment theme right now?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.460]   It's artificial intelligence.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.320]   And which city has some of the most artificial intelligence companies and jobs?
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.100]   Well, that's San Francisco.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.140]   So what's happening is everywhere I go, whether it's to play pickleball or to go on a play
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.180]   date or to go on a birthday party with the kids, I'm always running into people who are
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.320]   either working in artificial intelligence or who are investing in artificial intelligence.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.000]   So anybody who's tried to lose weight knows that one of the keys to losing weight is to
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.920]   not have all those yummy sugary cookies and baked goods in your house.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.780]   You throw all that bad stuff out of your refrigerator and just don't buy it.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.040]   Because if it's not in the refrigerator, if it's out of sight, out of mind, you won't
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.860]   eat those cookies and all that bad stuff that's going to make you gain weight.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.140]   So simple solution to a difficult problem, but it works.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.020]   So I got to thinking, well, the simple solution to staying retired is to actually get out
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.180]   of those cities, those cities that have so much going on.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.700]   New York City, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Austin.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.220]   A lot of these cities are attracting a lot of go-getters, right?
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.420]   They're people who want to build wealth, grow their careers, gain national attention, whatever
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.420]   it is.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.300]   They're some of the most hungry go-getting people around.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.880]   And so what happens is you can't help but run into a lot of go-getters out there and
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.900]   a lot of successful people out there.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.060]   So if you're trying to kick back, relax more, not think about money, just enjoy the remaining
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.820]   time left you have on earth, or maybe spend more time with your children, being in one
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.340]   of these cities is not conducive to staying retired and relaxing.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.900]   For example, just the other day I went on a three-hour play date, lovely day in San
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.020]   Francisco on the West Side, and a father was talking about his Y Combinator reunion.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.100]   He is an alumni.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.800]   Y Combinator is a tier one startup incubator that invests in all these companies, such
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.580]   as Airbnb, and it's been very successful.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.220]   It's made a lot of people a lot of money, and it's one of the mainstays here in San
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.220]   Francisco.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.780]   And he was saying the other week they had a reunion, and so many people showed up, and
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.420]   they talked business, they talked clients, and he noticed that 60 to 70% of the latest
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.860]   YC batch are all AI companies.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.260]   They either started as AI companies or they pivoted to AI.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.260]   60 to 70%.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.660]   So if you were to invest in that vintage of the fund, well, you're going to get 60 to
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.300]   70% of companies exposed or completely exposed to AI.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.940]   And so I immediately got to thinking, "Wow, I would like to invest in that fund, that
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.420]   vintage of fund."
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.420]   And then I started thinking, "Well, surely a lot of these companies must be hiring, whether
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.180]   it's engineers or business development people or communications people.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.340]   Why not, instead of just investing in artificial intelligence funds or funds that invest in
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.380]   artificial companies, why not also try to get a job at one of these high-growth artificial
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.820]   intelligence companies?"
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.620]   Because if you can see the future, why not go all in, all in with your investment dollars
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.400]   and all in with your time by working at a company that you believe in?
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.500]   A company could be using AI to find or assist in cures for diseases in several ways through
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.860]   drug discovery, protein folding, gene editing, epidemic prediction, early diagnosis, drug
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.300]   testing, treatment optimization, and so forth.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.220]   The possibilities are endless.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.060]   And what's more important than helping people live longer and better lives?
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.760]   I think it's wonderful.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.220]   So to be a part of a company that can do that and also grow and make you money, that sounds
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.020]   like a triple win to me.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.540]   And that's something that I think I would like to be a part of and many other people
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.140]   would like to be a part of.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.340]   So just imagine you have a lot of free time.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.460]   You have enough passive income or semi-passive income to cover your basic or desired living
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.720]   expenses.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.020]   You exercise three to four times a week.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.280]   Maybe you're playing pickleball for two hours each time.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.060]   And then you get to go swim in the bay and you're feeling physically healthy.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.680]   But mentally, you're not being very productive.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.780]   Maybe you could do some writing.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.960]   Maybe you can write a book.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.340]   But after a while, it's a lonely endeavor and you want to be a part of a community.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.020]   And meanwhile, you're living in a city where almost 70% of the people you meet is involved
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.220]   in AI and in this revolution somewhere and you just can't escape it.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.500]   So you will naturally feel like, "Man, maybe you should be a part of that revolution as
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   well.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.980]   Maybe you should get involved.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.400]   Maybe you should eat that cookie, that toffee crunch cookie that just came out of the oven.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   Why not?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   It smells so good.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   It tastes so good."
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   What's the big deal?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.500]   You just can't help but take a bite.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.840]   And that's the same thing with living in a city that has a lot going on, so much going
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.280]   on that you just can't help but get off your bum and try to get involved because you see
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.760]   other people involved and we're social and human creatures who want to get involved as
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   well.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.880]   So if you'd like to stay retired once you retire early, if you want to get rid of all
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.160]   that FOMO, then relocate to a slower-paced city.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.240]   And it's not just early retirement.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.160]   It's any retiree who wants to just get away from all the mania involved and the go-getting
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.800]   involved.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.280]   Relocate to a slower-paced city.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.620]   For me, that city is Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.960]   It comes as close to a better-balanced city that I found in America.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.600]   Whenever I go to Europe, it's very slow-paced and people really work to live.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.140]   That's what I feel when I step off the plane in Honolulu is people are just more chill
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.000]   and that stress level just declines one or two notches.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.660]   It's probably the weather, the flowers, the plumerias.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.620]   It's just a wonderful city.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.720]   You'll certainly find your people and fun things to do in a slower-paced city.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.760]   You just won't be constantly bombarded with the urge to do more.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.520]   If you'd like to get deeper into this topic, click over to the show notes and you can read
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.320]   my post on why it's so hard to stay retired once you retire early.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.880]   To summarize that post, here are the main points.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.480]   One, after a lifetime of work, it's hard to completely stop doing anything productive.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.280]   Two, there's this perpetual fear of losing money in a bear market, which is hard to predict
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.080]   when it'll happen.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.640]   Three, unexpected financial variables pop up all the time that need to be paid.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   Four, if your investments lose money, there is this inherent desire to try and make back
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.800]   your losses by taking action.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   Five, unless your mind is gone, you'll naturally find new passions in retirement to fill the
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.640]   void and some of that can include work, paid work.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   Six, boredom and loneliness.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.080]   We are social creatures and you've seen since the pandemic that there's been an explosion
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.680]   in loneliness and that's not good for your health.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:50.200]   And then finally, as I said, being in a city that is surrounding you by an explosion of
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:57.560]   go-getters because of some exciting new technology, it just makes you want to get involved.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.260]   Thank you everyone for listening.
