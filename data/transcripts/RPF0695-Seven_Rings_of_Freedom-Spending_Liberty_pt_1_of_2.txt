[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.720]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today we continue our
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.320]   7 Rings of Freedom series. These are 7 specific actions you can take that will enhance your
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280]   personal liberty as you work your way toward financial independence.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.160]   Today is Ring #4, where we're going to talk about spending liberty, the value of being debt-free,
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.320]   and having some savings. By way of review, Ring #1 was Spiritual Liberty. I talked about how
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.440]   if you as an individual possess spiritual liberty, then no matter how difficult or constraining your
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.920]   external circumstances can be, you as an individual can live a life of peace and joy and contentment
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.800]   in the middle of those circumstances. Whereas if you don't, as an individual, possess spiritual
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.400]   liberty, no matter how externally great your circumstances are, you can be bound as a slave
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.560]   in the middle of those circumstances. That was show #1, where I talked about spiritual liberty.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.400]   Show #2, I talked about Spousal Liberty. I talked about how much benefit I've received in my family
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.840]   and how much freedom I've enjoyed from having a stay-at-home wife and having a stay-at-home mom,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.920]   and how that's brought tremendous freedom and liberty to our family unit and how we value that.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.800]   So I talked about the value of Spousal Liberty. Show #3, I talked about Family Liberty. I talked
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   about the value of home education, having your children involved in your family enterprises
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.960]   rather than institutionalized, and how that gives you tremendous freedom and flexibility in your
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.520]   lifestyle, and how much I've come to appreciate the freedom that comes with that decision.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.360]   Now today we're going to talk about Spending Liberty, and here's where we need to introduce
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.560]   some of the more financial topics, because these topics are extremely important. I didn't exactly
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.600]   know what order to put them in. I don't think that these have to be done in order. I think you can
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.920]   pick and choose, and each person might choose different ones of these to do. But from my
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.600]   experience, if I were going back 10 years and I were approaching my life, and let's say that I
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.560]   were caught in a lifestyle of no liberty and I wanted to achieve liberty, this is the order that
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.520]   I would do things. So that's all I can say. Your mileage may vary, but this is the order that I
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   would pursue these things. The great thing is, of course, that most of these are fairly simple.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.120]   Spiritual liberty, that's a very quick process. Spousal liberty might take a little bit longer,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   but still I think it's primarily just a decision and a quick process. Family liberty,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.480]   fairly quick. Knowing what I know now, if I woke up in a situation where I didn't have that,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.360]   I would immediately move into that. Now this is the pivot point, though, where this process can
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.160]   take a little bit of time. And I want to talk about debt-free and having some savings.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.160]   Now you'll notice that these â€“ I'm going to define these words, but I want to talk about
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:28.240]   the value of being debt-free. There are some very compelling reasons for you to be debt-free.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.400]   You say, "Well, Joshua, obviously I would know that. It's fairly clear." But I think the reasons
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.360]   go a little bit deeper than most people experience. It's been my observation that
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.640]   although many people would say they'd like to be out of debt, they just simply don't do what
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.120]   it takes to get out of debt. And they never experience the freedom of being debt-free.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.280]   And so I want to talk to you and share with you, hopefully, some ideas that will help you to give
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.400]   a vision of it so you'd be willing to put in the hard work of becoming debt-free. The number one
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.160]   reason why I value being debt-free so highly is that if you don't owe anybody any money,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:23.120]   you have total freedom in your future choices. If you're out of debt, you have almost total freedom
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.520]   in your future choices. You can make any decision that you want to make,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.480]   even the most radical life-changing decisions, if you are out of debt.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.200]   Immediately prior to recording the show, as an example, I was reading an article on how few
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.520]   Americans are choosing to marry and how many Americans are waiting until they've paid off
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.000]   their student loans in order to marry. Now, certainly you can consider whether you want
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.960]   to be debt-free when you marry. It's fine. I wouldn't. I would make the decision based
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.720]   on whether I wanted to marry or not, and I would make the money fit to that. But I understand what
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.760]   people are going for when they're saying, "I want to pay off these student loans."
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.920]   And I think it's a good example of how many people's lives are put on hold because of debt.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.640]   You're told, "Go and take student loans out so you can get a good job," and people go and get
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.480]   a good job. But then what they do is they find that their life decisions are constrained by the
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.200]   fact that they owe student loans. Recently, I was talking to a student, graduated from university,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.280]   got a master's degree, has $30,000 in debt, and isn't really sure what she wants to do with her
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.440]   career, isn't really sure what she wants to do with her life, but she's got this $30,000 of
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.000]   student loan debt hanging over her head. And it limits the fun of any decision she could make.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.760]   She's totally free. She could go and live on an organic farm or work in a communal,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.800]   a commune somewhere, or she could go to the big city and get a big job.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.040]   And any of these life choices are available to her. She could go and build a big career,
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.800]   she could go and live in a van in the woods and write novels for a living.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.480]   Anything is there except for the debt. And until she pays off the student loan debt,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.120]   she won't have that total freedom of choice because she knows that she's got to go and service
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.200]   her debt. She's the kind of person who would do really well in some of those not so normal
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.520]   lifestyles, but she's stuck. She's got to go and get a job that's a high paying job so she can pay
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.800]   back her student loans. Now in her situation, she's not even, there's no marriage prospects in
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   the future and not particularly interesting to her, but you could see how she's stuck because
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.520]   of her past decisions. If you don't owe anybody any money, then almost any decision that you want
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.600]   to make can be made. If you don't owe anybody money, you can change careers fairly easily.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.400]   If I have somebody who is debt free and I'm coaching them and they say, "I don't really
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.080]   like my job, don't really like my work, I'd like to change to something else." I don't even have
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:17.440]   to ask about the financial impact. I just encourage them, "Go for it." But it's not so
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.600]   simple if someone is in debt because if you're in debt, you've obligated yourself to fulfill your
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.040]   word and pay back your debt, which means that you may or may not be able to afford it.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.440]   Similar things about starting a business. If you're not in debt, you can start almost any
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.720]   business. Some businesses lend themselves more to a lean startup approach, some businesses you
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.680]   need a lot of money. But if you're not in debt, you can open yourself up to almost any business.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.440]   If you don't owe anybody any money, you can work almost any job and have enough money to pay your
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.160]   bills while starting a business. So, it completely, radically frees up your future.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.920]   If you don't owe any debt, you can make the most radical of life decisions and you can do
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.720]   almost anything you want. Decide that you're tired of living in Atlanta, Georgia, and the
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.680]   south of France is calling your name. If you don't owe any debt, if you don't owe any money,
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.760]   you can go to the south of France and you can find a way to provide an income for yourself.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.000]   There's plenty of ways to work for room and board and to get a job and you can go live in the south
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.800]   of France. But when you have debt, it requires a whole different level of planning. I can't promise
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.200]   somebody with $100,000 of student loans that they're going to be able to service their student
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   loan debt in the south of France. I can promise that person that, "Hey, you can go there and let's
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.480]   figure out a way for you to get room and board so you can survive and let's figure out a way for you
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.920]   to make a little bit of spending money. You can go do it. Let's make it happen fast, quickly."
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:55.600]   I can do that if they don't have any debt. You can't do that if you have obligations.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.240]   So being debt-free gives you almost total freedom in your future. Now, this should be obvious. This
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.720]   should be sensible because after all, what is debt? Well, debt is a promise
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   to pay a certain series of payments and money back in the future. Somebody gives you money and you
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   say, "Thank you for this money. I'm going to use this money to do something that I want to do.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.960]   It could be buy a new computer, could be buy a new car, could be buy a college degree. I'm
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.800]   going to use this money and I promise to make you a series of payments in the future."
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.040]   So it should be obvious that you have less freedom because you've made promises in the future.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.120]   But it's only once people get into debt that they start to realize, "Hey, my future is pretty
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.360]   constrained." So I would encourage you as a financial planner, I have coached,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.560]   I think I could say safely thousands of people at this point, but let's just keep it modest,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:01.200]   hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. And you can't bring me a goal
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.800]   that I can't tell you how to achieve in a reasonable time if you're out of debt.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.520]   But when you're in debt, some goals become much more difficult to achieve.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.360]   Being debt-free gives you total freedom in your future.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:30.560]   The next big benefit of being debt-free is that it removes almost all fear from the present.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:39.520]   Being debt-free removes almost all fear from the present. Here's why.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.280]   In order to have this total freedom, you often need to pair it with some frugal living skills.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.640]   But a man who has the ability to live well on little,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:00.080]   possesses a sense of confidence and a sense of ability and a sense of possibility about the
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.120]   future that somebody who has to pay a lot of money all the time just simply can't imagine.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:15.600]   Those skills are important, but you can't employ those skills if you've already committed to a
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:24.720]   massive outflow. If you've already committed to an outflow, a monthly outflow of $1,500 per month
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.640]   that you have to pay, you can't apply frugal living skills to make that number go down.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   In theory, maybe some negotiation skills, you can renegotiate that to some degree,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.680]   but you can't apply frugal living skills to it. You can make all the coffee you want at home. You
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.280]   can buy all the cheap on-sale food that you want at home. And at the end of the day, you still got
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.840]   to make that $1,500 payment out. But if you don't have any debt, if you don't have any guaranteed
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:57.200]   payments that go out from you, it removes almost all fear from the present. Because you can stop
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:04.640]   almost any financial outflow from your life except a debt payment. If you don't have any debt,
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:12.080]   but you lose your job, you can tighten your financial belt to nothing very quickly,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.480]   or very close to nothing. If you don't have any debt on your car, and you lose your job,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.920]   and you have no source of income, and you don't have a little bit of savings, you can simply park
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   your car, you can drop the insurance from it, and you can let your car sit there. And now your car
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.600]   is no longer consuming money from you. You can turn your car expenses from normally, say, $300
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.080]   per month to zero. But you cannot do that if you have debt. If you have debt, let's say you have
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   a car payment, you have to make that monthly payment. If you don't make the monthly payment,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.480]   they come and take your car. And you may have to sell the car. So you could say, "Well, I have debt,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.320]   and I could always sell the car." Yes, but if you sell the car, now you can't just turn it on
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   quickly again. If you need another car, you have to go and buy a car. Whereas if you're debt-free,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.800]   and you have a $20,000 car sitting in your driveway, and for some reason your cash flow
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.400]   drives up, you can park the car, drop the insurance, not put any gas in it, and ride a bicycle.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:17.440]   Immediately, you can remove massive levels of spending from your life.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.280]   What about something like having debt on a cell phone? You go and you buy a cell phone,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:31.760]   and it's a $1,000 new cell phone. And you set it up on an Apple Pay loan. Well, no matter what,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.840]   you've got to pay that monthly payment. If you don't, it'll be reflected on your credit payment.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.080]   If you just simply pay cash for your phone, and if you use a prepaid phone plan,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   then if you run out of cash flow, and that $40 a month or $30 a month or $20 a month is a problem
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:55.040]   for you, you just simply stop paying your bill. And as soon as you haven't broken your word on
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.160]   anything, you just don't renew your prepaid contract, and boom, at the end of the month,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.920]   you lose your cell service. But you don't lose the functionality of your phone. You can still
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.800]   go and use it at the local free Wi-Fi. So now, if your cash flow dried up, you ride your bicycle
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:16.080]   to the local library, and you use the free Wi-Fi to do your email and send WhatsApp messages, etc.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.480]   Which, by the way, is one of the reasons why I find it very convenient to move communications
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:27.200]   away from phone numbers over to messaging platforms, be it Wire, Signal, WhatsApp,
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.600]   Facebook Messenger, whatever your... even iMessaging, whatever your messaging platform
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.560]   of choice is, it's very convenient. Because then you can just simply stop paying.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   But you can only do that if you haven't borrowed money.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.560]   Now, when we move to bigger bills, I'm using some little ones, but if you move to bigger bills,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.040]   like housing, things do become a little bit more complex. But it's a lot easier
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.480]   if you don't have a mortgage. Let's talk about if you own a house. If you own a house,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.160]   and you have a mortgage on that house, if you stop paying the mortgage, fairly quickly,
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.960]   your mortgage company can foreclose on you and forcibly eject you from the house.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.200]   Now, if you don't have a mortgage, you have additional layers of safety.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.040]   It's not possible to remove all housing expenses, at the very least, unfortunately,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.640]   in the United States. Although you can move to a country where you don't have
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.400]   property taxes, unfortunately, in the United States, you always have to deal with property
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   taxes. It's impossible in the United States to ever own your house. But it's at least possible
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.600]   if you don't own a mortgage... sorry, if you don't have a mortgage, if you don't owe a mortgage,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.440]   it's at least possible to not be kicked out of your house. Let's say that you own a $300,000
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.840]   house and you live there, and your property taxes are $3,000 per year. Well, if you don't make that
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.400]   $3,000 per year property tax payment, they are not going to evict you from the house. It's just
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   simply a lien accumulates against the house. But at least you can live in that house and stay there
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.000]   for the rest of your life. So you're dramatically safer if you don't have a mortgage. It'd be nice
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.760]   if we didn't have property taxes. I'm not going to die on that hill, but at least they're not
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.280]   going to evict you. Now, you do want to be careful. This is one of the reasons why I don't
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   like homeowners associations, because one of the most dangerous institutions is a homeowners
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.120]   association. If you live in a community, at least in Florida law, I'm not sure about every state law,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.560]   but if you live in a community that has a homeowners association and you don't pay your
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.840]   homeowners dues, then they can foreclose and evict you from your house, even if you have no
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.240]   mortgage on the property. So I consider homeowners associations to be extremely dangerous from a
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.440]   financial perspective. It's like a mortgage. So be cautious about them. The point is though,
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.000]   that if you don't have a mortgage, you can at least stay in the house. And then if you need
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.720]   to do something dramatic to pay your property tax bill, you could do something fairly simple,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.080]   like take on one part-time boarder, rent out one room of your house, and that could provide enough
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.520]   income for you to cover your property taxes. Or you're going to simply let the lien accrue on
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.120]   the property until your cash flow comes back in, and then go ahead and pay off the tax lien.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.440]   So if you don't have a mortgage, you have tremendous safety and you can drop your
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.880]   expenses to almost zero. Now, what about if you're renting? Well, if you don't have a mortgage,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.280]   if you're renting an apartment, one of the nice things is the time horizon of your decisions is
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.800]   much smaller. If you're renting an apartment and you need to go now, you can go now. If you need
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.200]   to move to a tent in the woods or to a camper parked on some government land, or if you need
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   to move to the spare bedroom at your mom and dad's house or the garage or move into the mother-in-law
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.240]   quarters out back of grandma's house or something like that, you can do that. You can just simply
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.320]   leave the apartment. You'll probably forfeit a certain security deposit. You may break a contract
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:03.360]   and impose a fee, but it's a lot simpler to do if you don't have any debt. But if you have to
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.920]   do that when you have debt, it's a lot tougher. So I think that's enough examples. The point is that
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:18.080]   because you can stop almost any outflow except debt, you can remove almost all fear from the
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:25.200]   present. What about outflows that you can't stop? Things such as food. You can cut those things
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:32.400]   pretty deep if you've got frugal skills. If I had to, I could feed my family of six on
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:39.920]   one to two hundred dollars a month, if I had to. Now, I don't think we'd have the most varied diet.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:46.960]   I don't think we would necessarily have the most nutritious diet long term, but we would do it.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.440]   If I were in a situation, and let's say that I lived in the United States, I had no debt.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.960]   Pretend that I live in a house that has no mortgage on it, no homeowners association,
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.880]   the only thing I have is property taxes, and I have no debt. And I go into dire financial
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.120]   circumstances. For some reason, my business fails, I'm disabled, etc. What would I do
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:14.240]   in that situation? First thing I would do, I would park the car or the cars. Assuming that I can't
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.840]   make money with them in some way, I'm going to immediately stop that liability. So I'm going to
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.600]   park the car, remove the insurance from the car, stop putting gas in the car, put it up on blocks,
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.080]   do whatever needs to be done, but I'm going to park the car. That removes a huge expense from
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.360]   many people's budget. Certainly limits their lifestyle and their mobility, but a bicycle
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.000]   can get me there eventually, or figure something else out. But maintaining that hundred dollar a
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.120]   month insurance payments is oftentimes expensive for people who are in dire financial circumstances.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:50.720]   I don't have a house payment, so I'm going to be pretty good there. If I don't have the money to
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.240]   pay my property taxes, I'll let them accrue and they can put a lien against the property,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.000]   but I'll just stay on the property. What about utilities? Well, I can change my usage.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I can unscrew everything electric in the house, and if everything in the house that's electric
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   is unscrewed, then my electric bill goes to practically zero. Now, obviously, I would want
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.880]   to maintain that ability, but because in many modern houses you can't live in them safely.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.520]   You live in Florida and you turn off the AC, all of a sudden you start to have mold problems based
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.760]   on the way the houses are designed, but depending on the house, you could look at it. You know,
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.320]   turn off your air conditioning, you turn off your heater, and you put on a coat,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.400]   you go jump in the pool at the midday, and you get a fan, or you open the windows, you do something.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.720]   You don't use the lights at night or use very small lights, right? If we're getting, and I'm
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.280]   just being hardcore just for the fun of the thought experiment, but maybe I have to harvest some
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.040]   electricity from somewhere. Maybe if I'm riding back and forth in somebody's car, I
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.320]   charge my phone or charge a flashlight or a lantern or some batteries. I mean,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.160]   you can harvest electricity from other places.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:03.840]   Many ways to do that. I could give example after example of how you could live without
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.720]   electricity. You can do it if you have the right equipment. It makes it fairly doable.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.880]   But you can build a solar oven to cook with, right? Build a solar oven to make your daily food.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:21.120]   Now, I'm going to skip because it just gets too weird to do all the weird ways of living
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.000]   without things, but you could do it. You could drop your utility expenses from $100 a month to
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.920]   $10 a month by dropping your usage. Those things aren't debt. They're declines in usage, and so
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:38.320]   you could affect your usage. What about food? Well, I would buy some flour. I'd buy some oil,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.360]   and I'd buy some sugar and some salt, and I'd be eating pancakes. I'd try to get some butter and
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.080]   things like that. I'd go to the food pantry if I could and try to do that to get some fresh
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.960]   vegetables or some kind of canned vegetables to supplement that a little bit. I'd get some rice,
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.920]   and we'd be eating rice and white flour. I mean, that stuff is so cheap, but at least our bellies
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.760]   would be full. Supplement some peanut butter and jelly and add some beans and a little bit of meat
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.720]   if I could get some from time to time. I'd be dumpster diving for food, depending on what
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:14.640]   context I was in. If you're in a rural context, then you can go and glean from the fields or go
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.320]   and wildcraft in the woods. There might be a lake that you could fish in if you're capable of
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.480]   fishing. If you're in a rural context, there's food available on the land. If you're in an urban
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.120]   context, there's food that's constantly thrown away. And so in either case, you could supplement
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:36.960]   your food and have food available to you. So in those dire circumstances, even the most dire
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:45.200]   circumstance can be overcome with debt, without debt, if you don't have debt. That gives confidence.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:51.920]   To me, that gives me confidence because if I need, I can get a job and cover some money. Obviously,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.720]   nobody wants to live without turning on their electricity. You don't want to unscrew all the
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.080]   light bulbs. And you can run a light bulb in your house at night for probably 50 cents a month.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.000]   It's just simply not... Most of us are not at that scraping by level, but there are some of us who
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.720]   are. And so I think at least just having the skills or going through the extreme thinking to
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.960]   say, "How would I live on nothing?" is worth considering. And then on the business side,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.640]   though, when you can cut your expenses so low, then it leads to more opportunities.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.600]   I've read a bunch of books written by homeless people. I try to read their stories. I talk to
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:36.000]   them sometimes and you can talk to them. But I'm interested in the ways that people live on nothing
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.440]   and the ways that people generate income on nothing. It fits my radical personality just
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.640]   to go to the hardcore extreme. And one of the things I've observed is that there are so many,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.920]   there's so much abundance where most of us live that if you're a person of skills and if you can
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:58.000]   maintain a sound mind and a sound body, even in one of those radical situations, you could do it
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.200]   if you didn't have debt. I could start a business at the library. The library system in many places
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.560]   have things like media studios. I could use a camera that the library has. I could use fancy
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.600]   computers that the library has. I could create media. I could build a business using the internet
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.520]   and the computers in the library every day. And the books are right there. Everything is there
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.440]   to start a business online. The books are there. The instruction is there. The computers are there.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.120]   The equipment's there. Everything is there where most of us live. We live in a world of
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:33.200]   possibilities. I could go and do day labor and be hired out there. And so when you don't have debt
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.480]   and you say, "I've got to live on $1,000 a month," you can do that and pursue a dream. Whether that
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.960]   dream is a business, whether that dream is something else, the fact that you don't have debt
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:53.520]   means you have total control of your expenses. That removes fear from the present. To me,
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:59.920]   that's always been powerful. That's why debtlessness is worth pursuing, because it
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:07.280]   gives you freedom of choice. You can change quickly. You don't have to make a three-year
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.840]   plan unless you decide you want to. There's no reason to run away from a job if you don't
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.920]   want to. But you don't have to make a three-year plan. If you have a business idea and you say,
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.160]   "This is a business idea I want to do," or, "This is a place I want to go," or, "This is a thing I
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:30.800]   want to do," you can pivot quickly. I have found that sense of freedom, that lack of fear, to be
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:38.400]   so valuable in my personal psychology. I've found it to give me tremendous optimism over the future,
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.520]   to give me a sense of resilience, to give me a sense of unlimited possibilities.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.440]   I look at the world and I say, "There's almost nothing that I can't do."
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.560]   And being out of debt is a key, key part of it.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.640]   Now, what else? Being out of debt gives you total control over your income.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:07.440]   When you don't have debt, then whatever your income is, you can just simply allocate it as
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:16.320]   you like. And what happens is that most of our desires are fairly modest. But when all of your
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.760]   income is pre-committed, even your modest desires sometimes become difficult to indulge.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.920]   If you've got a median income of $4,000 or $5,000 per month, but you have no debt,
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.560]   you can fulfill on a regular basis almost any impulse purchase that you'd like to make.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   Want to buy a new barbecue grill? Buy a fancy $600 smoker? No big deal. It's a tiny fraction
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:49.280]   of your income. Want to take a trip? Spend $1,500 on a nice vacation? You can do it.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.800]   Want to spend $5,000 on a nice vacation? You can do it. You need a few months probably,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:00.720]   but you can do it. Need a new car? Well, you can buy a new car or another car, right? You can buy
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.800]   a couple thousand dollar car any month that you want to. Need to buy a new set of tires? Well,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.680]   it's a thousand bucks. And a thousand bucks for a new set of tires for a lot of people
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.600]   is a lot of money, but not when you're debt-free, even if you have a median income of $4,000.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:24.160]   $5,000. And so when you don't have any payments and you have the ability on a monthly basis to
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.360]   have full control over your income, it makes a lot of things really doable for you.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.560]   What about kids' college education? Let's say you're a median household earner,
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.600]   but you can make a plan to where you're debt-free, completely debt-free, including
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:47.120]   your mortgage, and you earn $5,000 per month, but you've got three or four or five children
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.280]   and you want to help support them in a college education. You can do that. If you don't have
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.680]   any debt, you can easily commit a thousand, $2,000 per month to college educations, which is more
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.960]   than enough, if they're frugal in their college choices, more than enough to simply pay for
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:11.120]   college educations, thus perhaps helping your children avoid debt. As long as everything else
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.640]   in your life is in line, you can adjust everything else down as long as you avoid debt. That ability
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.760]   to have total control is really, really fantastic, because when you have total control over your
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.720]   income, it gives you the ability to make the decisions in the present that you believe are
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.720]   right, and you don't have to spend a lot of time thinking about them. You don't have to spend a lot
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.920]   of time worrying about them. You frankly just have less buyer's remorse. The times in my life where
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:43.520]   I've had the most buyer's remorse is when I have borrowed money to do something. Let's say that you
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   want to go on a trip, and you say, "I'm going to go to Egypt and see the pyramids of Egypt,
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:56.560]   and I'm going to spend $5,000 on it." You put the $5,000 on a credit card, go to Egypt and come back.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.800]   You're probably happy with the trip, but if a year later you're still paying off the balance
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:08.960]   of that credit card, the trip starts to feel a little bit more sour. Whereas if you just simply
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:15.280]   pay the $5,000 out of your cash flow, even if you come back and you say, "You know, that was a little
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:21.600]   bit more money than I would have liked to have spent," that regret is fairly short-lived. Then
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.920]   you say, "It was a nice time," and you start saving for your next goal. When you have total
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:34.160]   control over your income, even if your income is modest, you generally have choices. Now, certainly,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.640]   we're all going to have some bills, and so it's hard to get always to the point where you have
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.600]   total control. In addition to no debt, you also want to just simply balance the commitments that
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.840]   you make. It's nice to have modest rent payments if possible where you live. It's nice to have just
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   a modestly priced lifestyle. But no debt gives you total control over your income. In any given
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   month, any given week, any given day, you have the ability to make the choices that are best for you
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:13.440]   right now. I, in addition, greatly value the sense of personal independence that comes with being
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:20.960]   debt-free. Many people complain about their job, their work. Some people feel like they're being
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.800]   abused at their work. If you don't have any debt, and if you have those frugal living skills that I
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:34.160]   described, the ability to live on very little, and if you have a little bit of savings, of course,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.320]   it makes it easier. But if you don't have any debt and you're being abused, you stand up,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.960]   you walk into your boss's office, you say, "I quit," and you leave.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:50.640]   I'd like to see you give some notice. I'd like to see you keep your options open. One of my goals
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.720]   that I encourage people is try to make sure that anytime you leave a job, they'd hire you back. But
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.880]   if you're truly in an abusive job situation you're being taken advantage of, you walk out.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:08.320]   Or what about if something is happening at your workplace that is morally wrong or ethically
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:16.560]   questionable? You don't have to think too much about it. You simply stand up, you say, "This is
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:23.680]   wrong," and you leave. And you might walk right into a newspaper reporter's office or publish it
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.200]   immediately online. You don't have so many obligations. But those are the kinds of decisions
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:35.680]   that are a little bit harder to make if there's going to be a cascade of bad consequences in your
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.560]   life. If you've got a mortgage payment of $2,000 a month, and you've got a student loan payment of
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.040]   $1,500 a month, and you've got a car payment of $500 a month, and you've got $30,000 on a credit
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.960]   card, you know that if you get up and you walk out of this job, there's a good chance that all
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.920]   those things will collapse. You know that there's a good chance if you stand up and you say, "No,
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   what you're doing in this company is wrong," and you walk out of that office, that you might find
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.280]   yourself on the street without a car, with the creditors calling, behind on everything.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:18.000]   It's a lot harder to do the right thing that you should do when you know in your personal life
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.600]   everything can collapse. But if you're out of debt, you know you can go and get another job.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.360]   You know you can live on nothing. And there are so many people who I think would be more willing
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:37.760]   to speak up for what is right, even though there's a risk for them if they were out of debt.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.360]   There are so many people who sit when they know they should leave because they're in debt,
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   and that's not a way to live. One of the most important things for you to maintain
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:58.320]   is your self-respect, your personal integrity, your ability to look yourself in the mirror in
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:06.080]   the morning and be proud of the man you see in front of you. You can't be proud of yourself
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:12.160]   if you're not doing the right thing. You can't do that if you're sacrificing your integrity on a
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:23.120]   daily basis. And it's a lot easier to stand up and say what you believe to be right, what you
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.520]   know to be true, if you know that your life is not going to collapse around you.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:42.400]   Important. In addition, being completely debt-free helps you to avoid the moral hazard of debt.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:49.520]   One thing that many people wrestle with is, "Is it wrong for me to borrow money? Is it immoral
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:56.800]   for me to borrow money?" Now, as I've wrestled with that question, my answer is no. Usually,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.160]   a lot of Christians who wrestle with that question, they do it based upon a comment that's
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:08.400]   written in the Book of Romans where Paul says, "Owe no man anything except love." And there are
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:14.240]   some people who take a very hard-line stance and say that that means don't owe anybody any money,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:20.880]   and so thus, no debt. I sympathize with that position. I don't personally believe that that
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.480]   one statement, when looked at in the totality of commentary on debt and borrowing money,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:33.280]   etc., in the Scripture, is enough to say that it's morally wrong to have a series of time payments.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:39.600]   Where I've come to in wrestling that through is that it's not morally wrong to make an agreement
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.360]   to borrow money from somebody and then to pay them back as agreed. What is morally wrong is
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:54.480]   to not pay them back as agreed because that is theft. So if I come to you and I say, "Will you
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.800]   please lend me $1,000?" It's your $1,000 and you have the ability to give it to me if you want to.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.520]   It's your money. You can do what you want with it. And so as long as I'm not threatening you,
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.160]   as long as I'm not coercing you, I'm not pointing a gun at you and saying, "Give me $1,000," if I
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.760]   come to you and I simply ask you and say, "Will you give me or lend me $1,000?" and you have your
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:24.480]   $1,000, you have the ability to give that to me entirely free, thus it's entirely right, no moral,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.280]   there's no moral problem here. And so if you give it to me and you say, "I'll give you $1,000,
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.720]   but starting one month from today, you're going to pay me, Joshua's going to pay you back $100
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.800]   per month for 10 months." Well, if I agree to do that and then I show up every single month and I
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:47.840]   give you the $100, everything is fine. This was our agreement, or let's say that you charged me
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.880]   some interest and so you say, "I'll lend you $1,000 and you pay me $100 for 11 months." And
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.520]   so I show up in the first month and I give you $100, second month, $100, third month, $100,
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:05.920]   fourth month, $100, thus everything is fine. Now, the problem comes in the sixth month when
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:11.760]   my child is sick and instead of being able to bring the $100 to you, I use the $100 to pay for
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:20.800]   medicine and a physician to check out my child. Well, now we have a problem because I have
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:29.360]   promised to return your $100 to you, but now I'm unable to fulfill my word. And so what I've done
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.640]   here is I've committed a sin of stealing from you because I said I would bring the $100,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:42.800]   it's your $100, you owe it, and now I'm not able to pay it as agreed and it's a form of theft.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.200]   Now, certainly it's a different form of theft, a less morally repugnant form of theft than if I
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.720]   stuck a gun in your ribs and just took the $100,000 and et cetera, but it is a form of theft.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:01.200]   And so when I've considered the morality of the situation, that's my conviction, is that it's not
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:07.680]   immoral, it's not sin for me to make an arrangement with you where you give me $1,000 and I agree to
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.880]   pay you $100, but it puts me in a situation where I may commit sin in the future if I'm unable to
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:23.760]   pay. And since I don't know what the future holds, that's a significant risk. And that's why it's
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:30.480]   very important to be very cautious before you ever strike your hand in a pledge. Maybe one thing for
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.800]   me to have $1,000 and to say, "I'd like to borrow $1,000 from you, but I know in the back of my
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.120]   head that I can pay the $1,000 back." That's less of a problem. And so there's a lot less danger,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.440]   let's say that I go and I'm looking and I'm shopping for a car and I've decided I need to
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.280]   buy a new car, I've got $100,000 in the bank, but the new car dealership will give me a better deal
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.400]   if I go ahead and borrow $20,000 at 0% interest, they'll give me a better deal on the car than if
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.880]   I just simply pay them cash. And I know that I've got the money in the bank, I know that thus I'm
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:08.320]   never going to wind up stealing from them, stealing the monthly payment, because I've got the money.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.800]   That's less risky than if I have no money and I go and buy the $20,000 car and I just simply sign
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.040]   my name knowing that I have no money and I'm presuming on the future to have the income.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.960]   So I don't see this as a black and white area, I think it's shades here that you've got to be
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.160]   cautious and prudent and conservative, but the farther you are away from that line, the farther
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.080]   you are away from ever borrowing money, the farther you are from ever breaking your word,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:45.040]   from ever stealing from another person. Now, obviously you can renegotiate debts,
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:50.160]   sometimes you can renegotiate payments and it's always your right to forgive a debt.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.800]   In addition, you have to deal with a contract. So for example, I'm much more comfortable
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.280]   whenever I, if I ever have to borrow money, although from a financial perspective, it's less
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   safe. When I've lent money, let's go to the different perspective. When I've lent money
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:11.440]   to people, for example, one time I sold a vehicle to somebody and I agreed for them to make a series
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.240]   of payments. What I've tried to do is structure the contract in a way that we can avoid the moral
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:21.360]   hazard and it has simply made it clear that I would simply repossess the vehicle if they didn't
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.480]   make a payment. And that's the way that a lot of times that auto loans can be satisfied, is that
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.920]   they're just simply going to repossess the vehicle if no payments are made. So if I'm in a situation
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.120]   and I make a pledge, I make a commitment, I'm going to borrow $20,000 from you, I'm going to
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:43.840]   use it to buy a car, but I'm going to pledge this car as collateral for the loan, then I can feel
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:50.400]   morally clear where if I'm unable to pay it, they repossess the vehicle and thus maybe I come out
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.080]   the worst because I had equity in the vehicle, but I'm in a position where I've had a sense of,
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:02.000]   I've not stolen from somebody. The agreement that we made was for you to repossess the car,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.480]   or the agreement was that you would foreclose on the house and thus when you foreclose on the house,
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.280]   if I'm unable to pay, at least I can walk away free and not wind up owing you money.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.920]   So those, whenever, if I'm ever in that situation, if I'm lending money, I try to structure it in
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.480]   some way that I don't, that we can have an out that satisfies the necessary terms and that
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:27.280]   satisfies the moral difficulty. Then of course we need to come in and you talk about things like
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   bankruptcy. And in the United States where you have bankruptcy laws, everybody knows those bankruptcy
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.400]   laws, and so things like bankruptcy laws, I don't view them as immoral because they're known whenever
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.680]   you lend money, whenever you borrow money. I think they're difficult and I think that that's where,
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:50.160]   as an individual, you have to question the intent of your heart. It's one thing if you, as an
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:56.400]   individual, are caught in a situation where you borrowed money, you took out money on a credit
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   card, and then some series of circumstances happened and you wind up declaring bankruptcy
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.360]   because of these circumstances that were relatively unforeseen. That's different than my making a plan
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:13.200]   to intentionally defraud somebody. And I go and I build a big line of credit cards, and then I
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.320]   borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit cards, and then I declare bankruptcy, but I've
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.240]   concealed or otherwise protected the hundred thousand dollars and taking advantage of the laws.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.800]   Well now we've got a situation where it's immoral, not because it's illegal, well that situation
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   probably would be, but not necessarily because it's illegal, it's just immoral. The intent to
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.120]   defraud is something that should weigh on your conscience. So I think there are ways to work
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.680]   through it in those situations, but the farther you are away from that line, the easier it is
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:46.960]   to maintain your integrity and to fulfill your word. And the most valuable thing that you possess
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.120]   is your word. And so word of caution to you, if you're ever in a situation where you wind up
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   borrowing money, make sure that you create an out for yourself, or that you discuss what would
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.600]   happen so that you can satisfy your word. This is especially important with individuals. If I'm
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.400]   going to go and borrow money from somebody, I'm going to say, "I'm going to borrow the money,
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.640]   here's what I'm going to do, but if I can't pay this back as agreed, I want to talk about what's
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.360]   going to happen and how we're going to satisfy this to make sure that we can maintain our
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:22.720]   integrity in this situation." So consider those things. All right, by way of review,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.320]   being debt-free gives you total freedom in your future. Being debt-free removes almost all fear
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:34.160]   or all fear from the present. Being debt-free gives you total control over your income. Being
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.040]   debt-free allows you to maintain your personal independence and makes it easier for you to keep
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:47.040]   your integrity and your good moral standing intact. These are compelling reasons, but what
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:55.760]   about some of the other sides? First, is it possible to avoid all debt? My answer is no.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:02.240]   It is possible to avoid all commitments of payment, but if we think about the full meaning of debt,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.280]   it's impossible to avoid all debt. So I'm not saying that you can't buy a car without a car
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.800]   loan. Of course you can. I'm not saying you can't buy a house without a house loan. Of course you
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.480]   can. But at the end of the day, there's always some form of debt, even if it's temporary.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.600]   For example, technically speaking, if we're going to think about this technically speaking,
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:31.360]   you agree to pay your electric bill after every month of usage. So you're using electricity today.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:37.120]   Well, you now owe an electric company money for the bill. You can't avoid that. You can do
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.560]   prepaid to some degree. You can give them a deposit. There are things that you could do,
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.160]   but at the end of the day, there's always going to be some forms of debt. And that's not even
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.040]   getting into personal debt, government debt, some of the other obligations and things that are
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:56.480]   imposed upon you. So it's technically not possible to avoid all forms of debt, but I see debtlessness
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:06.080]   as a scale. The closer you are to zero, the better the results and the returns. The less, the better.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.480]   But you don't have to get to zero to start enjoying the benefits. In a moment, we'll talk
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.800]   about good debt, bad debt, et cetera. But the closer you are to zero, the better. Because
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:25.680]   every step towards zero gives you increased levels of freedom. So let's use an example here.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:35.920]   Let's assume that you are a deeply indebted family. You have a house mortgage, you have
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:44.640]   a car loan, you have student loans, and you have a credit card debt. You don't have a lot of freedom
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.600]   because you're deeply indebted, but you decide, "I'm going to make progress on this debt."
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:57.120]   And so the first thing that you tackle is your car loan, because you don't need a $50,000 car
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.440]   that you owe $30,000 on. So you decide, "I'm going to go ahead and sell the $50,000 car
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.600]   and buy a $5,000 car." Well, that gets rid of one payment. Then you take that excess payment
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.320]   and you use it to reduce your credit card debt. And so now you're left with simply your student
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:18.640]   loans and your mortgage payments. Then you get a new job offer. And the new job offer is going to
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:25.920]   pay you less money than you're currently making, but it has much higher long-term potential for you.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.280]   And it's in a career direction that you're more interested in.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:34.880]   Previously, you couldn't have taken a pay cut because you were pretty well maxed out. You had
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.720]   to make that car payment, you had to make those credit card payments. But because you sold the car,
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:43.200]   thus reducing your cash outflow needs by the amount of your car payment, and because you
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.960]   paid off or paid down your credit card debt, now you can take a reduction in cash. So you bought
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:55.440]   yourself freedom by lowering the amount of debt that you owed. So fast forward, you move into the
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   new job and you're in a situation where you keep on paying and now you get rid of the student loans.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.120]   So the only thing that you owe now is a mortgage on your property. But you decide, "This new job
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.840]   is not for me and what I actually want to do is I actually want to move to the south of France."
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:18.640]   Well, are you totally debt-free? No, you still owe a mortgage. But you can sell the house,
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.520]   pay off the mortgage, and then go. Or you can rent the house, pay the mortgage on a monthly
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.840]   basis, and go. And so even if you don't get to completely debt-free, every step towards lower
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:38.640]   and lower debt buys you freedom. Every single step of the way helps you. And so don't think
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.920]   that it has to be all or nothing. Think that there's a scale here. And the closer I get to
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.280]   complete debt freedom, the more and more personal freedom I'm going to enjoy. But there is
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.960]   a scale. The less the debt, the better. But you don't have to get to zero to start enjoying the
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:04.000]   benefits. Let's talk about some questions. Will you get lower long-term returns without debt?
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.840]   Or will you have less money without debt? For example, if you're going to buy a house,
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:18.080]   should you just simply rent for $1,500 a month until you can save enough money to pay cash for
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:25.520]   a house? Or should you buy a house and take out a $1,500 a month mortgage so that you can be
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:31.920]   building equity in the property over time? Well, I think the answer to that is pretty clearly that,
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   yes, you will get lower long-term returns and/or have less money by avoiding all debt.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:47.440]   If you put two exact circumstances together, circumstance one, person lived in a rental
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:54.720]   house for $1,500 a month until they could save, let's say they had $2,000 a month of excess cash
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.040]   flow. And option one is to live in a rental house for $1,500 a month and save $500 a month towards
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:07.440]   the purchase of a house. And option two is for them to get a mortgage of $1,500 a month and then
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.320]   put an extra $500 a month towards the pay down to the mortgage. The numbers every single time are
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.640]   going to come out in favor of the person taking out the mortgage. It's just simply going to result
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.200]   in their having more money in the long term through buying the house. The question is,
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.120]   are they going to have more freedom? I'm unconvinced the answer is yes on that.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:32.480]   What you see, where you saw it most dramatically was in a time like 2008, where so many people were
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:38.560]   underwater on their mortgage that they just didn't have the ability to go where there was work. They
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.440]   didn't have the ability to go quickly. And so the job market had high-paying jobs on one side of
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.880]   the country, but people who were in a low-paying job often couldn't leave because their house was
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.000]   underwater and they couldn't sell it for what they owed and they couldn't get out of it.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.240]   And so although I think you can make the argument that often debt will enhance your returns,
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   debt will result in your having more money, I don't think you can make the argument that debt
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.080]   is going to lead to more personal freedom, which is why I said there's a scale here.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:15.200]   The scale would be if you only had the mortgage, well, you can often rent the house out. So
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:23.040]   is it wise to always avoid all debt? I'm not sure that it's, I don't know, I don't think it's always
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.600]   wise to always avoid all debt. I do think that always avoiding all debt will lead you to higher
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:35.360]   freedom. Another way to think about it though is to look and say, are there things that I could do?
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   So in that scenario, I said, which was very simple, you got $2,000 a month of cash flow,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.720]   you could pay $1,500 a month of rent, save $500 for the house. Yes, you're going to come out every
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.720]   time better to buy the house if that's the only circumstance. But are there other things that you
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:57.360]   could do that would keep your freedom and move you in a different direction? Could you rent for $500
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.720]   a month while saving the $1,500 a month? Could you buy a house for $70,000 as a starter house
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.800]   so that you could avoid the debt while you're saving for the bigger house? And would somebody
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.600]   doing that come out in a better situation? I think a lot of times if you change those variables,
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:22.560]   somebody who's committed completely to avoiding all debt can often come out ahead, both financially
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.160]   and in terms of freedom. I can't make that argument if it's a direct comparison, but if you
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:37.840]   say, I want the freedom and I want the freedom to avoid the debt, but I also want the financial
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.800]   returns and I'm willing to change my lifestyle, to change the variables, I think you can create
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.480]   really compelling financial plans that work. And that's why I think people often miss the long-term
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:57.760]   planning opportunities. They often look and say, they undervalue the ability to move for a job
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:04.080]   quickly, to pivot. Example, let's go back to our $2,000 a month example. You're in option A,
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.160]   you're earning $50,000, but all of a sudden, if you can move right away, you can get a job
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:14.080]   making $100,000 a year. Well, I bet if we put all that into a financial plan and I could boost your
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:19.920]   income by keeping you mobile enough to move fast, you could do it. So just think about that and
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:27.280]   recognize that life is not only one variable. Your only variable is not either renting or buying a
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:32.480]   house. There are many variables and in the midst of those, you can find a plan that satisfies the
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:40.800]   circumstances of your particular situation. What about things like debt for investments?
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:50.160]   Again, if we create two scenarios, scenario A is you're going to be an investor and you're going to
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.040]   invest using other people's money or scenario B is you're going to be an investor, but only using
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:01.280]   money that you've saved. Well, if everything goes well in both investments, the debt will usually
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:09.360]   increase your returns markedly. I can't go to somebody who wants to buy houses and say,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:15.200]   "You're going to get better returns by not borrowing money." I just don't see any way to
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.840]   make that mathematically work. The returns are going to be better with borrowed money.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.240]   But what I can say is if you desire the freedom of debtlessness,
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.440]   then you can adjust your decisions in a different direction. So for example,
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:37.600]   if I were speaking to somebody in the United States and they're thinking about investing in
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:42.720]   real estate in the United States, I have to advise them to use some amount of other people's money,
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.800]   just simply because the money is given away at basically free interest rates.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.200]   And it is a robust lending market. There's tons of money available to do that.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:59.520]   But the returns are also pretty limited because of that. So yes, the returns are possible,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:04.560]   but the returns are often not nearly as exciting as some other place. Whereas if somebody says,
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   "I don't want to borrow money because I want to keep freedom," I advise them to invest outside
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:15.280]   the United States. All of a sudden, if you move from the United States to a developing country,
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.920]   $20,000 in the United States is hard to get started in real estate investment. $20,000
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.240]   in a developing country can often make a big difference as a real estate investor.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.160]   And often in a developing country, there just simply isn't the money available.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.080]   And so you can make higher returns and you can start to boost your profits more quickly. So you
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:37.520]   can adjust your investment portfolio and your investment plans in a way that satisfies your
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:44.800]   desire for freedom. Don't ever think of it as just one variable. So my answer to the question,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:51.120]   will you get lower long-term returns without debt? Probably. But will you maintain your freedom?
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:59.040]   Will you sleep better at night? In a lot of cases, yes. Best plan is probably some middle-of-the-road
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:07.040]   plan, but you don't have to view your desire for freedom as something that's automatically going to
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:16.640]   impoverish you. You can have both. What about good debt and bad debt? Is there good debt and bad debt?
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:23.520]   Usually when people talk about it, they would say that bad debt is for something like a consumption
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:30.000]   debt. A consumption debt would be you go and you put a new TV on a credit card. That's a
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.520]   consumption debt. And so they would say that's bad debt. You bought an asset that plummets in
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.400]   value the moment you take it out of the box and you put it on a credit card. That's bad debt.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.880]   Whereas people say good debt is debt that helps you make more money. So it might be debt for
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:53.280]   student loans or debt for a new piece of equipment that you can leverage in your business or a house.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:55:00.880]   That might go up in value. I think that that is a sound method of analyzing debt. I certainly think
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:07.280]   that one should never borrow money for a depreciating asset. That's simply foolish.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:13.120]   It's consumption. It's foolish. And if something is a consumption expense, there's no way to make
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:21.680]   that a good decision. And that there is good debt. You can take debt and you can leverage it for
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:27.520]   increased gains, especially if you follow some of those rules. So you can use other people's money
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.480]   or use the bank's money to buy a house that you then rent out and make money on. That's powerful.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:38.320]   And the results grow quickly. I frequently advise people to do that. It is certainly true that if
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:44.560]   you borrow money on student loans, that might work out because it qualifies you for a career
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.720]   that can be a very high earning career. If you look at this as some of the extreme examples,
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.960]   somebody who incurs large student loans for a medical degree, a law degree, or a fancy
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:01.280]   certification or credential of some kind that does later qualify them for a very high earning income,
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:08.800]   it works out financially in a lot of situations. But even in those situations, it does limit
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:17.600]   freedom. It does limit choices. I have counseled many high earning professionals who have been
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:23.840]   frustrated with how they're stuck because of their student loans. It's difficult. Let's say you've got
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.720]   two doctors who marry each other and they each have $300,000 of student loans and they're trying
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.800]   to figure out how do we do this. I've talked to a lot of people that want to make a different change.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   And so you will have to consider for yourself. What I would say is that there's probably some
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:46.000]   balance that would be wise to consider. Being somebody who prioritizes freedom,
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:53.120]   I can't imagine I would ever commit myself to a six-figure student loan. I just can't imagine it.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:57:01.520]   I would do a military contract. I would go to medical school in Mexico. I would do a self-study
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:07.440]   legal license or something like that. Some way of avoiding the significant amount because what I've
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.800]   observed is oftentimes I don't like to follow through on stuff. And so if I did really have
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.320]   a lot of experience, maybe I went and worked as a paralegal and I said, "Yeah, I really like this
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.960]   legal stuff. I've been studying on my own. I'm really sure." Fine. There's a place for it. But
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.280]   anything you can do to maintain your freedom is going to... to minimize your debt is going to
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:31.040]   maximize your freedom. And I've known a lot of some people, I've talked to people again and again
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:39.120]   and again who say, "You know, I started this path and now I'm stuck in it." And what I despise as
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:44.240]   somebody who enjoys freedom is I despise that feeling of stuckness. Because when I'm stuck,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.560]   my creativity dries up, my joy dries up. I just start to feel frustrated and it's a matter of
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:56.800]   getting out as quick as possible. I don't like that feeling. And so for me, I'm going to minimize
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:03.120]   the debt. So is there good debt and is there bad debt? Yeah, I think so. So what are some rules
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   that you can do to put in place? Number one is that if you're going to borrow money, try to have
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:14.400]   an out. Try to have an asset that you can sell and try to make sure that you're conservative.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:19.680]   So if you borrow money for a rental house, you borrow $200,000 but you buy a house and the house
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:26.960]   is worth $205,000 or $220,000 so we can pay real estate commissions. If you decide you don't want
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:32.160]   to be a landlord at some time, you're not generally stuck. As long as you've got a house that's not
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.520]   some weird monolithic dome that you can't sell, as long as you've got a cookie cutter house that
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:41.840]   you can sell and you can sell it for $220,000, then you can get out. And so you can get out
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.480]   fairly quickly. So if you're going to borrow money, try to make sure that you're borrowing
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.600]   money for an asset that's going to back it up. That's going to be one of your best ways out.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.200]   If you're going to borrow money for a business, make sure that you're only borrowing in a way
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.120]   that you'll be able to sell it. It's one thing to borrow money for an excavator to start an
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.960]   excavating business, but you can always sell the excavator. That's different than borrowing
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:06.160]   $30,000 on credit cards to start a business that has no tangible value that you can't sell.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.880]   And so in those situations, be careful. If you are going to borrow money,
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:15.360]   try to borrow money in a way that keeps more freedom. So for example, if you're going to
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:21.280]   borrow money for a business, I'd rather borrow money from my customers by pre-selling something
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:26.560]   than borrow on a credit card by committing myself to something else. I'd rather set up
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.200]   an arrangement where I pay somebody based on commission and profits rather than committing
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.560]   to pay salaries that I'm taking out from an SBA loan. And so if you think about the things that
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:41.840]   you strike your hand to, you can structure things in a way that keeps maximum levels of freedom for
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:53.360]   you. And when you're setting up loans and such, make sure that you clearly understand the creditor
[00:59:53.360 --> 01:00:00.480]   protection laws and bankruptcy laws that apply to you and use those laws to your favor. Make sure
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:08.960]   that you always structure something in a way that, "Hey, if I couldn't pay this, at least I would be
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.920]   able to discharge it in bankruptcy. If I can't pay this, at least I can sell the asset and not be
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:21.680]   owing a difference. At least there's a non-recourse loan if possible." Understand the laws and always
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:28.080]   set things up in a way where you're protected so you can maintain your freedom. That's why I teach
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.760]   so much technical financial planning, because if you can empower somebody with the knowledge of the
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:40.960]   laws, then you're in much better situations. It may not always be possible for you to avoid debt.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:47.120]   You could be the most committed person in the history of the world to avoiding debt,
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.400]   and then you wind up with a medical emergency, with bills that aren't covered by insurance,
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.880]   and you wind up owing debt, owing medical debt. You could be in that situation. And again,
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:08.560]   probably every single listener to this show, you owe debt. Your governments have borrowed
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.040]   huge amounts of money from your children and grandchildren. They've done it in your name,
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.560]   and they're going to try to collect their tax dollars every single day to owe your debt.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:24.640]   So you can't avoid all debt, but you can eschew debt. You can minimize debt. And the closer you
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:32.480]   get to zero, the more personal freedom you will enjoy. Very, very important.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.320]   If... Maybe I'll do this at some point, but I want to do a show at some point called
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.160]   basically The World's Simplest Financial Plan. And I'll just simply tell you this.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.840]   If I could give one advice to anybody, if you just simply avoid debt, you avoid the vast majority of
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.640]   problems that people... that worry people, that stress people, that wind up ruining people's
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:03.440]   lives. So avoid debt. The closer you can get to owing zero dollars, the more you will enjoy
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.400]   personal freedom. There is another component of this. You need to have some money and some savings,
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.640]   and that's also part of my fourth ring. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to end today's show
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.560]   here, and I'm going to talk about savings as a separate show, part two of this fourth ring.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.320]   Because simply being out of debt, there are cases where, yes, you're debt-free, but having no money,
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.880]   that does actually get you less freedom. If you have $100 a month that you owe, you have a $10,000
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:36.560]   credit card debt, and you have $10,000 in the bank, and your credit card wants $100 a month
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.880]   from you. You have more freedom, more choices, more freedom of choices to have the $10,000 in
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.760]   the bank and simply to owe $100 a month in the credit card than you do if you have zero dollars
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.560]   of credit card debt and zero dollars of savings. There are things that you could do in the $10,000
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:00.640]   in the bank situation that you can't do if you have no savings. Simple example, you want to move
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.200]   for a job. Well, if you have $10,000 of credit card debt, but you have $10,000 of savings, you
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.440]   need to make a security deposit and a first month's rent payment on a new house to live. And you can
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.680]   do that if you got $10,000, but you can't do that if you have zero dollars in credit card debt
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.600]   without going back into credit card debt. So next, we'll talk about savings in part two of this show.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:26.320]   Now, as I close today's show, when I did this show, I wanted to launch a... I want to do a
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.840]   course on getting out of debt. In some ways, it's obvious that there's nothing, there's no magic to
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.040]   it. You just pay extra on the debt. That's it. There's no magic to it. But there's a whole lot
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.600]   of techniques that in the years that I've gone in and out of debt, I've found and I've studied that
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.040]   can get much faster results. I'm not ready to launch that today because I'm doing the preparedness
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.320]   course. So I decided I'd go ahead and finish the series off and we'll launch that. But hopefully,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.080]   in the next few weeks, I'll be able to launch that out. For today, remember that I'm teaching
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:01.120]   a preparedness course starting on Monday, February 3. So go to radicalpreparedness.com.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.640]   And in the meantime, what I'll tell you is this. I've done a lot of consulting over the last few
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:14.080]   months. And many times, I have been able to do something. I'm able to do something now that I
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.960]   wasn't able to do when I was a professional financial advisor. And that is to give people
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:25.680]   a plan that leads to good financial results and good lifestyle results. And to have somebody leave
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.520]   a consulting call happy. It used to bother me when I was a financial advisor and all I had was a
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.520]   financial planning software. And people would come into my office and they'd say, "I want to
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.960]   accomplish these certain goals." And I'd put the numbers in and they never had enough money. They
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.560]   were never saving enough money. They never had enough money. And I'd put this chart in front
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.920]   of them about how much money they needed to save for retirement. It was just filled with red
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   everywhere indicating a shortfall. And in hindsight, they would always leave my office less
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:59.040]   excited than they were when they came in. Part of that was my youth naivete, my lack of skill.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.400]   But part of it is just the system, the mainstream financial system that says that the only solution
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.640]   is to save more money for retirement. I don't buy it. I'm done. I don't buy it. You should have a
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.800]   life now that you don't want to retire from. And you can have that quickly. And certainly, I used
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:23.440]   to tell people, "Get out of debt." Of course I did. There's lots of ways to do it. But what I have
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:30.320]   found is that now in doing financial planning for people, I can usually find a plan that results in
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:38.240]   pretty quick results. And most people leave a consulting call with Joshua feeling encouraged
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.080]   about the future. Even if there's some work involved, even if they know they got 10 months
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.720]   or a year of work, they leave encouraged. And I want that for you. So if you're in debt,
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   keep your ear out. First, recognize that you're going to have to pay it off.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:58.320]   You pledged your hand. You said you would pay it. So pay it. And there's not any secret other than
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.720]   making money, not spending it, and paying it in debt. That's what you're going to have to do.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.160]   But there are some things that you can do. So keep an eye out for my course. I'm going to try
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.280]   to do it as a low-priced course. I don't like doing low-priced courses, but I want to do it
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.200]   on this subject just to help people who get out of debt. Because I would love to have thousands
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.040]   and thousands of people around the world get out of debt and experience the freedom that comes from
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.080]   being debt-free. So I want that for you. But in the meantime, reach out to me for a consulting call.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:31.760]   Email me at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. And I'll help you. I'll help you. I'll charge you for
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.920]   it. I'm not going to work for you for free. But email me at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.800]   If you need help and you can't afford my consulting fees, your best deal is join as a patron of the
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.920]   show. Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance and sign up there and join me on a Friday call.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.280]   And on a Friday call, we'll talk through it and we'll work through your situation. So that's going
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:54.720]   to be your cheapest option as well. But do one of those things and make a goal that this is the year
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:00.960]   that you get out of debt. Once you experience the control of your income, once you experience the
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:08.080]   sense of freedom in your future, once the fear flows out of your present, you're going to have
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:15.280]   a major increase in the amount of your personal freedom. Set it as a goal. Make this the year
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.640]   that you get out of debt. If it takes you two years, it's still worth it. Make this the next
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:24.560]   two years that you get out of debt. And generally, you shouldn't need more than two years to get out
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.160]   of debt. There are potential situations in which you do, but the vast majority of people just need
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.840]   a plan that results in you're getting out of debt in less than two years and you can do it. So make
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.440]   this the year. Make it a goal. You won't regret it. The LA Kings holiday pack is back. The perfect
