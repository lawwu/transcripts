I talked about the value of home education, having your children involved in your family enterprises, rather than institutionalized, and how that gives you tremendous freedom and flexibility in your lifestyle. And how much I've come to appreciate the freedom that comes with that decision. Now, today we're going to talk about spending liberty. And here's where we need to introduce some of the more financial topics.

[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:38.380]   If you don't have any debt on your car and you lose your job and you have no source of income and you only have a little bit of savings, you can simply park your car.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:45.380]   You can drop the insurance from it and you can let your car sit there and now your car is no longer consuming money from you.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.380]   You can turn your car expenses from normally say $300 per month to zero.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.380]   But you cannot do that if you have debt.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you have debt, let's say you have a car payment.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   You have to make that monthly payment.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you don't make that monthly payment, you have to pay your car.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you don't make that monthly payment, you have to pay your car.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you don't make that monthly payment, you have to pay your car.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you don't make that monthly payment, you have to pay your car.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   If you don't make that monthly payment, you have to pay your car.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:25.780]  , and you may have to sell the car.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   So you could say, "Well, I have debt and I could always sell the car."
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   Yes, but if you sell the car, now you can't just turn it on quickly again.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   If you need another car, you have to go and buy a car.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   Whereas if you're debt-free and you have a $20,000 car sitting in your driveway,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   and for some reason your cash flow drives up, you can park the car, drop the insurance, not put any gas in it, and ride a bicycle.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.820]   Immediately, you can remove massive levels of spending from your life.

[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   You go and you buy a cell phone, and it's a $1,000 new cell phone, and you set it up on an Apple Pay loan.

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:24.820]   and you have a mortgage on the house. If you stop paying the mortgage fairly quickly, your mortgage company can foreclose on you and forcibly eject you from the house.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:30.820]   Now, if you don't have a mortgage, you have additional layers of safety.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   It's not possible to remove all housing expenses. At the very least, unfortunately, in the United States, although you can move to a country where you don't have property taxes, unfortunately, in the United States, you always have to deal with property taxes.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:16:14.700]  ,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:44.720]  ,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   and you have to deal with property taxes.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   So, you're dramatically safer if you don't have a mortgage.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   It'd be nice if we didn't have property taxes. I'm not going to die on that hill, but it's, but at least they're not going to evict you. Now, you do want to be careful. This is one of the reasons why I don't like homeowners associations because one of the most dangerous institutions is a homeowners association. If you live in a community, at least in Florida law, I'm not sure about every state law, but if you live in a community that has a homeowners association and you don't pay your homeowners association, you don't pay your homeowner's money,
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:17:14.740]   then they can foreclose and evict you from your house, even if you have no mortgage on the property. So, I consider homeowners associations to be extremely dangerous from a financial perspective. It's like a mortgage. So, be cautious about them. The point is, though, that if you don't have a mortgage, you can at least stay in the house. And then, if you need to do something dramatic to pay your property tax bill, you could do something fairly simple, like take on one part-time boarder, rent out one room of your house, and that could provide enough income for you to cover your house.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:14.740]   You could rent out one room of your house, and that could provide enough income for you to cover your house.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:14.740]   You could rent out one room of your house, and that could provide enough income for you to cover your house.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:14.740]   You could rent out one room of your house, and that could provide enough income for you to cover your house.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   Or, you're going to simply let the lien accrue on the property until your cash flow comes back in, and then go ahead and pay off the tax lien.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   If you don't have a mortgage, you have tremendous safety, and you can drop your expenses to almost zero.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   Now, what about if you're renting?
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   Well, if you don't have a mortgage, if you're renting an apartment, one of the nice things is the time horizon of your decisions is much smaller.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   If you're renting an apartment, you're renting an apartment, you're renting an apartment,
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:18:14.780]   and you need to go now, you can go now.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   If you need to move to a tent in the woods, or to a camper parked on some government land,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   or if you need to move to the spare bedroom at your mom and dad's house or the garage or move into the mother-in-law quarters out back of grandma's house or something like that,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   you can do that. You can just simply leave the apartment. You'll probably forfeit a security deposit. You may break a contract and impose a fee, but it's a lot simpler to do if you don't have any debt.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   You can do that. You can just simply leave the apartment. You'll probably forfeit a security deposit. You may break a contract and impose a fee, but it's a lot simpler to do if you don't have any debt.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:14.780]  , but it's a lot simpler to do if you don't have any debt.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   I'm not a lot simpler to do if you don't have any debt.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:22.720]   But if you have to do that when you have debt, it's a lot tougher.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.900]   So I think that's enough examples.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:34.140]   The point is that because you can stop almost any outflow except debt, you can remove almost all fear from the present.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.580]   What about outflows that you can't stop?
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.020]   Things such as food.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:43.780]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.800]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   You can cut those things pretty deep if you've got frugal skills.

[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:05.820]   and then go. Or you can rent the house, pay the mortgage on a monthly basis and go. And so even if you don't get to completely debt free, every step towards lower and lower debt buys you freedom. Every single step of the way helps you. And so don't think that it has to be all or nothing. Think that there's a scale here. And the closer I get to complete debt freedom, the more and more personal freedom I'm going to enjoy. But there is a scale.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:04.140]   I think that's a good question.

[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:45.760]  obed all debt I'm not sure that it's I don't know I don't think it's always wise to always avoid all debt I do think that always avoiding all debt lead you to hire freedom.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:56.500]   hear
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:13.460]   S Got Ð’ÑÐµ in,,,,,
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:43.400]  berger: Could you buy a house for $70,000 as a starter house so that you could avoid the debt while you're saving for the bigger house? And would somebody doing that come out in a better situation? I think a lot of times if you change those variables, somebody who's committed completely to avoiding all debt can often come out ahead, both financially and in terms of freedom. I can't make that argument if it's a direct comparison.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:21.640]   nine
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:30.980]   are don

[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:50.860]   that satisfies the circumstances of your particular situation.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:56.500]   What about things like debt for investments?
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:02.900]   Again, if we create two scenarios, scenario A is you're going to be an investor.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:08.100]   And you're going to invest using other people's money.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.700]   Or scenario B is you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.200]   Well,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Well, you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Well, you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Well, you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Well, you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Well, you're going to be an investor, but only using money that you've saved.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.580]   think

[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   So you can have both.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:11.440]   And you can leverage in your business or a house that might go up in value. I think it's important to consider the two.

[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.760]   In some ways it's obvious that there's nothing, there's no magic to it.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.600]   You just pay extra on the debt.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.140]   That's it.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:58.920]   There's no magic to it, but there was a whole lot of techniques that in the years that I've gone in and out of debt, I've, I've found, and I've studied that can get much faster results.

[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:28.940]   So I decided I'd go ahead and finish the series off and we'll launch that, but hopefully in the next few weeks, I'll be able to launch that out for today.
