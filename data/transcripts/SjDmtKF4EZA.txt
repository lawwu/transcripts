[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Is your startup burning too much cash? Here's a good way to measure it. I call it the burn multiple.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.440]   The formula looks like this. Burn multiple equals net burn divided by net new ARR. And you want to
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   measure this for a given period. For example, if you burn three million dollars in a quarter and
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.120]   you generate one million dollars of net new ARR, that's a burn multiple of three. Once you measure
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.360]   your burn multiple, you can assess whether it's good or not. I have some rules of thumb around
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.360]   this. If your burn multiple is under one, that is amazing efficiency. If your burn multiple is
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.000]   in the one to one and a half range, that's great. If you're at one and a half to two, that's good.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.200]   Two to three, you're getting a little bit iffy. It's suspect and over three is bad. Every company
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.760]   that's successful that wants to become profitable will eventually have to reduce their burn multiple
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.240]   so low that it hits zero. So that's the goal. Start with a burn multiple that's high in the
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.000]   early days and gradually get it down over time. That's how I think about how to manage your burn
