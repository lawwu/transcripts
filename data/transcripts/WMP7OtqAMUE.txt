[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   In order that we may know how to obtain that heaven below and heaven above, I call your
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   attention to the words to be found in the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 3
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.240]   and verse 8.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.840]   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof; but canst not tell
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.680]   whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.880]   Now here we are given the key, I say, to that type of life depicted in that hymn by Augustus
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.880]   Toplady.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.840]   And what a hymn it is, and what a profound expression.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.440]   Christians think that that tune prevents some of us, particularly, from realizing the fullness
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.920]   of what is there offered us and what is possible to us in the Gospel.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.720]   Now here I say in this third chapter of John's Gospel, especially in this incident in connection
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.920]   with Nicodemus, we are given the key to this whole order of life.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.800]   That was, as we have been seeing, the whole trouble with Nicodemus.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.520]   He would persist in thinking religiously instead of spiritually.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   What a tragedy it is that one has to make such a contrast, and yet we constantly have
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.160]   to do so.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.200]   Religion should never be the greatest enemy of the true Christian faith, but it is.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.340]   In practice it is, and it has been so throughout the centuries.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.640]   That is where we see the effects of the fall and of sin in men, that he will even degrade
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.040]   the very things of God and turn them into the very opposite of that for which they were
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.080]   intended.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.720]   Now the answer to all that is that therefore we must be born again.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.800]   As we are by nature, we have no understanding at all of the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.320]   Jesus thought he had, we all tend to think we have, but we haven't.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.280]   And so our Lord makes it abundantly clear.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.820]   He must be born again.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.120]   We need a new mind, a new heart, a new everything.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.920]   And what we are doing now, as you know, most of you, is to consider whether we have this
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.280]   new life in us, whether this great thing has taken place in us, that by the Spirit of God
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.800]   we have been born again, born of the Spirit.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   And there are many, many ways in which we can test that.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.400]   The one test we are dealing with at the moment is one of the most wonderful of all, and that
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.680]   is our relationship to God and our knowledge of God.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.600]   You see, this is something, as I must keep on reminding you and myself, this is something
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   which is internal.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.400]   Our Christian faith is not something outside us that's true of morality, that's true
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.960]   of law always, but this is inside us, something spiritual, something living, not only for
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.600]   the mind but for the heart, the whole of man is engaged and is involved.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.240]   And as we've been seeing, one of the leading characteristics, therefore, of this life is
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   this increasing desire for a personal knowledge of God.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.000]   There it is expressed in that hymn of Toplitz, "Object of my first desire" – that's
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.480]   it, Jesus crucified for me.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.840]   And all that he goes on to express that.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.640]   Now, I've been trying to show that this is one of the most wonderful proofs of all
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.680]   of the fact that we are born again, that we desire this personal knowledge of God – God
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.280]   the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit – more than anything else, more than
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.160]   we desire a knowledge of theology, a knowledge of the scriptures, more than we desire to
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.720]   be moral and good, more than we desire even experiences as such.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.440]   It is this concentration upon the person.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.760]   Let me sum it up in order that we may move on by putting it like this.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.240]   This is, of course, the thing that one sees so clearly in the human analogy.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.220]   The child, without understanding why or how, desires the parent, particularly in times
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.300]   of grief or sorrow or trouble.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.400]   Everything else is thrown aside and nothing will do but the person.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.320]   I remember once this being brought home very forcibly to me by an old friend of mine who
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.800]   was also a great saint.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.240]   He and I were talking and a little child was with us and was tending to disturb the conversation.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.320]   I turned rather impatiently to the child and I said, "What do you want?"
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.640]   The child answered, "I want mother."
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.760]   The old saint rebuked me and reprimanded me.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.360]   He said, "There you are, you see."
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.600]   He said, "You say, 'What do you want?'"
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.800]   The answer is, "A person."
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.000]   Not what, but the person, the mother.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.960]   Well now that's the whole thing I say that is being put before us here.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.880]   And this is therefore one of the most delicate tests we can ever apply to ourselves.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.280]   You see, we can become involved in a routine.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.840]   That's always the danger with religion.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.360]   We can be content with church membership and things like that.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.240]   But this is the ultimate test.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.440]   When there is life, it cries out for life.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.360]   And the true Christian cries out for this intimate knowledge of the Father and of the
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.080]   Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.480]   Now we've considered in a very general way our desire for the Father and our knowledge
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.360]   of him in that way and likewise the Son.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.200]   I took them in the other order.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.600]   We started with the Son because we're dealing with this matter experimentally.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.560]   And then we arrived at the knowledge of the Father.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.320]   And that brings us now to consideration of this knowledge that is possible to us of the
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.960]   Holy Spirit.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.200]   I don't want to go into this in too much detail, but I've already reminded you that
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.760]   the saints have testified to this, that it is possible to have this separate knowledge
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.600]   of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.920]   Well now, in connection with our knowledge of the Holy Spirit, there is a term that is
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   used in the New Testament itself, which gives us the key to the understanding of this matter.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.240]   It talks about the communion of the Holy Spirit, or the communion of the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.480]   Take what is called the apostolic benediction, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:09.240]   love of God and the fellowship or the communion of the Holy Spirit abide with you.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.200]   Now that's, I say, the key to the understanding of this matter.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.480]   It means fellowship, communion, cooperation.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.720]   These are all the meanings of the term that was used by the apostle there in that benediction.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.040]   But it also includes communications from, communication with.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.560]   It's all in this word that we translate as fellowship or communion.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.720]   It sometimes can also be used for a kind of partnership.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.280]   It's often used in that sense in the New Testament, a kind of partnership.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.460]   We read that some of these disciples were partners together with their father in fishing
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.880]   and in tent making and things of that kind.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.240]   Well now, here is the term that is used to describe our relationship with the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   The apostle can wish nothing greater than that to the Corinthians, and so he puts it
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.880]   there at the end of his second epistle to them, that they may know of the grace of the
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and this communion, this fellowship, this communication
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.640]   with, this partnership with the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.920]   And what we must try to do this morning is to discover something itinerant of the content
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.640]   of this great term.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.320]   How may we know this?
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.800]   How may we know whether we really are enjoying the fellowship, the communion of the Holy
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   Spirit?
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.520]   Well I suggest that we can know it in the following way.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:50.200]   The first is that we are definitely aware that in our, to use the term in general, religious
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.920]   life, we are not doing everything ourselves.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.440]   Now what I mean by that of course is this, that the religious man does everything himself.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.680]   He is in charge, and he takes up his religion and puts it down again.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.200]   The religious man is not aware of anything apart from himself and his own activity.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.400]   He believes it's a good thing to worship God on Sunday morning, well he does so.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.240]   But if he feels he won't do so on a Sunday morning, well he doesn't do so.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.480]   He is in charge, he does everything.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.640]   He believes in a certain amount of religion, he misinterprets a text which says "be not
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.720]   righteous over much", which he interprets as meaning you mustn't take these things
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.680]   too seriously.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.600]   He is in charge of these things and in control.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.340]   That is always the characteristic of the religious man.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.120]   And he believes therefore that all depends of course upon his faithfulness, upon his
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.080]   activity, and upon his zeal.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.040]   Now that is always and invariably the characteristic of the religious and the moral person.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.720]   It's always, as I say, a very self-contained life, not generally self-satisfied for the
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   same reason.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:15.880]   It sets up its own standard, satisfied that it is keeping it up, and other people don't
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   of course, but this person does.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.520]   Well, we needn't waste our time on this.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.800]   Our Lord has described this very perfectly for us in his famous parable of the Pharisee
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.440]   and the publican who went up into the temple to pray.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   It's all there.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.640]   The publican, you remember, goes right forward to the front.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.720]   And he gets up and he says, "I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men are, especially
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.480]   as this publican.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.640]   I fast twice in the week, I give a tenth of my goods to the poor."
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   That's typical.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.960]   You see, he doesn't ask for anything, doesn't need anything.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.880]   He's so perfect.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.320]   He is doing it all.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.160]   He just thanks God that he is as he is.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.560]   Not aware of any need, not aware of anything dealing with him at all, he's in charge of
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.000]   the whole situation, and very pleased with the result.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.800]   That's the Pharisee.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.760]   That is the religious man.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.920]   He's not aware of any outside influence at all.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:30.000]   But he has believed certain things, chosen to do so, and he now puts them into practice.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.360]   And it's all very neat and very compact and all very tidy, and all is well.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.960]   You remember what our Lord says about him, and how he contrasts him with that poor publican
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:49.520]   who scarcely feels that he's worthy to enter into the place at all, but beats his breast
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.160]   and can simply cry out for mercy and for compassion.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.840]   Now then, there is one picture of it.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.080]   The Apostle Paul gives us an equally clear picture in his own bit of autobiography in
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.000]   the third chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.880]   He describes what he used to be and how, well of course again he was doing it all.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.320]   He happened to have been born, a Pharisee may have been born, a Hebrew, and he was very
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   proud of it.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:25.000]   Circumcised the eighth day, the stock of Israel, tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of the Hebrews,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.320]   touching the law, Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   which is in the law, blameless.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.560]   That's it.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.200]   Same picture.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.040]   Well now then, that I say is the characteristic of the man who is merely religious, but it
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.880]   is never the characteristic of the man who is spiritual.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.040]   This man is aware above everything else that he is what he is by the grace of God.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.360]   Now, it's very difficult to put these into words.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.400]   One either knows that or one doesn't.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.160]   If you, I say again, can explain what you are and why you are what you are, you're
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   religious.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.280]   But if you're amazed at it, you're spiritual.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.160]   That's the first thing therefore that is quite obvious.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.400]   But I go beyond that, we must go beyond that.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:19.480]   And the second step therefore is to assert that this man who is born again, this spiritual
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:28.840]   person, he is aware of the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.960]   The religious man, I say, is not aware of any presence.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.320]   He's just got a system.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.520]   And he lives within his system and tries to fulfill and carry out his own system.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:49.440]   But the essence of the true faith is an awareness of the presence.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.800]   Or if you like, let me put it still more generally, it is the awareness of another.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.640]   You can't get rid, in other words, of this mystical element in the Christian faith.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.080]   Now it isn't mysticism.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.080]   It isn't mysticism alone.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.240]   It isn't bare mysticism, which is philosophical.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.640]   I say a mystical element.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.280]   In other words, this is experimental, this is personal.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.200]   And if it isn't personal, it isn't true.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.680]   You see, not only do you see this personal element in the scriptures, you get it there
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.040]   in these great hymns.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.360]   The greatest hymns have always got that personal element.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.920]   Look at the hymns and always notice the dates.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:36.240]   You'll find that the hymns that are composed in periods of revival and awakening and reformation
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.920]   always have this personal experimental element, very prominent.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   You can almost tell by the hymn when it was composed.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:53.040]   You watch the hymns in the Victorian era when they didn't know much about revival, and
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.360]   you lose this and they sentimentalize about their own inward moods and feelings.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.080]   There isn't this awareness of the other.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.200]   It's this morbid introspective sentimentality.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:14.160]   Well, the point I'm making is that the really great hymns always have this objectivity,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   this awareness of the other, and are therefore aware of being dealt to him, by him.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.280]   That's the thing I'm emphasizing.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.800]   In contrast to the man who does it all himself, the thing that the Christian man, the spiritual
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.720]   man, is most conscious of is that he is being dealt with, and that he's in the hands of
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.760]   another.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.320]   You will find terms like this in connection with our relationship to the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.600]   resisting the Spirit, grieving the Spirit.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.160]   Now the point I'm trying to establish is that it is only a spiritual man who knows
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.240]   the meaning of those terms.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:03.720]   He does know what it is to resist this other, or to grieve this other.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.680]   Now, the other man, he doesn't know that.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.400]   Well, all he knows is this, that he may not have come up to his standard now and again,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.240]   or he may have done things which he regards as wrong.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.440]   But you see, he's still judging it entirely in terms of his own standard.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   He's annoyed with himself.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.720]   He feels he's let himself down.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.360]   He feels he must do better.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.000]   But it's all in terms of himself.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.680]   But the whole point about this other man is this, that what troubles him is that he has
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.400]   resisted the Spirit.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:42.080]   The Spirit was operating upon him, was acting upon him, and he was rebellious, he was resistant.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   And he's aware of the fact that he has grieved and hurt and wounded the Spirit.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.440]   Now, there are many hymns that express this.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.360]   Take the hymn of William Cowper, for instance.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.440]   He puts it so clearly.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.240]   After such a period in his life, obviously, he cries out and says, "Return, O holy dove,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.160]   return, sweet messenger of rest.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:14.080]   I hate the sin that made thee mourn and drove thee from my breast."
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:21.280]   You see, the personal reference and the personal relationship, and this is of the very essence
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.240]   of this new life that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.000]   It is a communion with God.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.400]   This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God in Jesus Christ, whom
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.240]   thou hast sent, and know in this experimental manner, so that when this man falls or fails
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.640]   or sins, this is the thing that he's most acutely aware of, that he's hurt and he's
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.440]   grieved, he's wounded the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.680]   So he pleads with him to return.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:00.320]   Now, this is something you'll find in the experience of the saints running down the
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.580]   centuries.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.440]   Something has gone wrong in their lives.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.680]   It may be due to some sin or it may not even be due to that.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.240]   But for some reason or another, they pass through a period of dryness and of aridity.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.160]   Now, it doesn't mean that they're no longer living the Christian life.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.080]   They are, because this is the thing that really troubles them.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:29.280]   They describe how, though they are still doing everything that they did before, they're
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.120]   reading their scriptures, they're praying, they're doing good, they're refraining
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.520]   from evil, they're living the Christian life as far as their will and their willpower
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.320]   are concerned, is everything that could be desired, and yet they're unhappy.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.960]   And you say, "Well, why are they unhappy?"
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.320]   Well, they'll tell you.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.080]   They're unhappy because, for some reason or another, they say, "I'm aware of a
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   dryness.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.360]   I don't seem to be realizing his presence."
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.280]   And they will struggle for a long period, some of them, in this very condition, and
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:10.480]   nothing can satisfy them until they're aware again of the old relationship.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.920]   They've renewed the relationship that somehow or another has become clouded.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.840]   Well, you see, there it is.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.680]   William Cowper again reminds us of it.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.760]   "Behind a frowning providence, he hides a father's face."
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.520]   But there are times when the Christian can only see the clouds and the providence which
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.340]   seems to be frowning.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:41.760]   And what he's most concerned about is that he should know again this relationship which
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.880]   he temporarily has lost.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.200]   And it's a most important point, this, because the devil comes and suggests to such a person
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.000]   that he might as well stop praying, therefore, which is, of course, nothing but the suggestion
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   of the devil.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.840]   The thing to do is to go on praying and to keep on knowing that he's there.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.360]   And then in his own good time, he will grant you again this realization of his presence
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.600]   and of your relationship to him.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.080]   Now, I don't want to elaborate on this this morning, because it would take us too far
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.040]   away from the immediate object which we have in view.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.280]   But let me say this in passing.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.880]   It is a part of the teaching of those who know something about the ways of the spiritual
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.840]   life to know this.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.160]   The old experts in this, the old teachers, used to talk about desertions, periods of
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   desertion.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.640]   They used to teach about how God averted his face, as it were.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.760]   And there is no doubt that this is very true.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.560]   It's a part of our whole understanding of the Christian life.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.240]   God for our good sometimes seems to withdraw himself and avert his face.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.480]   I believe it is in order to make us grow.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.640]   We'd remain children if he didn't do this.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.320]   He wants us to become such that we'll trust him as it were in the dark, trust him in spite
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.040]   of feelings, trust him in spite of everything, rest on his bare word and say, "Though he
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.120]   slay me, yet will I love him."
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.360]   But the thing that comes out of all this, you see, is that the Christian is aware of
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.920]   this relationship and therefore is grieved and troubled and unhappy when for the time
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.680]   being he lacks it or he misses it or he has lost it.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.320]   Well, then there is the second step.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.560]   It is an awareness of his presence.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.640]   But we go beyond that even.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.920]   The Christian, this spiritual man, this born-again man, is a man who is therefore aware of his
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.680]   dependence upon the Spirit.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.040]   And this, of course, takes it yet further.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   In other words, he's discovered that he can't rely upon himself.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:56.400]   And he learns to rely more and more upon the Holy Spirit and his presence and his power.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.800]   You see, the whole of the Christian life is really life in the Spirit.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.320]   That's the great contrast that the Apostle Paul draws, for instance, in chapters 7 and
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.000]   8 of the Epistle to the Romans, and particularly in chapter 8, "Ye are no longer in the flesh,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.760]   but you are in the Spirit."
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:19.480]   The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.840]   That's the great contrast.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.280]   You are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of Christ dwell in
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   you.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.840]   For if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:36.440]   Very well, it is a life, I say, in the Spirit.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.240]   And this governs one's entire outlook.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.280]   Let me work it out like this very briefly for you.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.760]   It is still, you see, this contrast between the religious men and religious practices
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:58.400]   and conformity to religious forms, and this living relationship and this living worship.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.640]   And the man who is spiritual, the man who is born of the Spirit, he no longer is content
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:13.240]   with merely following the forms, because to him that can be empty, can mean nothing.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.080]   He is concerned about this spiritual element.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.400]   Our Lord himself taught this.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.680]   He taught this to the woman of Samaria, you remember.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.680]   That was the whole essence of the discussion between our Lord and the woman of Samaria.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.960]   She was a religious woman.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.840]   There she is worshipping in this mountain.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.800]   She says, "My forefathers have taught that you should worship God in this mountain, but
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.000]   you Jews, you say that God should be worshipped in Jerusalem."
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.760]   And there she is, tied with places and forms and so on.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.520]   And our Lord answers and says, "God is Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.400]   in Spirit and in truth."
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.440]   And the test therefore which we apply to ourselves is this, the character of our worship.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.640]   The character of my reading of the Bible, the character of my prayer life.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.600]   There's nothing to prevent a man sitting down and deciding to read the Bible.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.280]   And he may have a lexicon, and he may look up the meanings of words, and he may have
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.320]   a concordance, and indeed it may be very wonderful.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.160]   It's a form of a crossword puzzle, and you become expert of the letter and the details,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.200]   and you may have it all at your fingertips as it were.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.640]   And you may read your Bible like that.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:32.360]   But what a world of difference there is between that and reading the Bible in the Spirit.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.200]   What I mean by that is that you realize that it isn't the letter that matters, but the
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   Spirit.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.400]   It isn't the words, but the message.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:46.440]   That it isn't as it were the actual material content, but the thing that's life there
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.440]   and living and suggestive and that speaks to you.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.080]   Oh, it's very difficult to put this thing into words.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.800]   I could tell you a great deal about this.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.840]   I know what it is to spend hours reading the Bible as it were in the flesh.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.680]   Not that I want to do so, but that I can't do anything else for the time being.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:11.160]   And then the Spirit comes, and the whole thing changes.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.480]   That of course is the romance of the Christian life, and if you'll allow me to say so, it
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.760]   is particularly the romance of the life of the preacher.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.960]   People have often said to me, a man said it yesterday to me, another minister incidentally,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.120]   he said, "How much longer are you going on at Westminster?"
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.680]   I said, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.040]   He said, "Well, how long have you been there now?"
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.880]   I said, "I'm in my 28th year, I'm nearly finishing."
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.640]   He said, "I don't know how you do it."
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.600]   And I said, "I don't, that's the whole point.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.720]   I don't know how I do it.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.600]   What I mean is this, you see, the man was arguing like this, and we've all often thought
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   like that.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.960]   You would have thought that a man, after a given number of years, would have gone through
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   the whole Bible.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   He's never finished, he's got to move.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.760]   No, no, no, no, that's not the spiritual approach.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.120]   You see, the marvel and the wonder, and I say again, the romance of it all, is just
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:08.880]   this, that you find yourself reading something that you've read dozens and dozens and dozens
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:17.960]   of times before, but suddenly, it's new, it's illuminated, it's glorious, it speaks to
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   you, it ravishes your heart, it puts you on your feet, and it goes on expanding, and it
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.960]   illuminates, as it were, for the moment, the whole of the rest of the Bible in a way you'd
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.960]   never seen before.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.320]   Now, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:37.920]   And so, one gets to learn that what rarely matters in this realm is the communion of
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.040]   the Holy Ghost, His natural ability.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.200]   That soon comes to an end.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.800]   One becomes tired and jaded.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:51.280]   I've often heard of men saying, they've left, why, well, I preached myself out, they
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   say.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   What a terrible thing to say.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.240]   Well, that means, you see, if you are doing it, you're bound to preach yourself out.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.480]   Your themes are limited and so on.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.160]   But when the Spirit is there and dealing with the Word and with you, there's infinite,
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.880]   endless possibility.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.120]   And it's exactly the same with prayer.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.240]   Prayer and prayer, what a difference between a man praying because he wants to pray, because
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:24.080]   he believes it's right for him to pray, and a man praying in the Spirit.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:30.560]   I can't find words to express the difference, but it is one of the most real things one
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.560]   can ever know.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.920]   I can't recall whether I've ever told you of two particular prayer meetings I've
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.320]   been privileged to be in in my life.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.200]   And if I'd never known anything about such things, I wouldn't understand this in a
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   measure.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.560]   But I was once in a prayer meeting.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.000]   It was a regular weekly prayer meeting, and one went to the prayer meeting on this particular
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.680]   occasion not expecting anything at all.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:01.440]   It started at 7.15, as usual, and it was in the summer, and everything seemed to be against
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   us.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.880]   And two people had taken part in prayer.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   It was much as usual.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.560]   They were good people, and they were doing their utmost.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.640]   Then another man got up, whom one never had regarded as a particularly spiritual person,
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:19.640]   but somehow in the mystery and the marvel of God's ways, the Spirit of God chose to
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.840]   come upon that man just as he was starting to pray.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.560]   And he prayed in a manner that was amazing and astonishing.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.440]   He began praying in the Spirit.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.040]   His very voice changed.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.640]   Everything changed.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   He was using English.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.420]   It was the same language.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   We all understood it.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.200]   There was no question of speaking in tongues, but it was true praying in the Spirit of men
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.640]   being taken up and lifted up.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.800]   And as a result of what happened to him, it happened to the others.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.320]   And on and on they went praying without any intermission until about 10 to 10.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.440]   Now that was praying in the Spirit, and one was out of time, and one was aware of the
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.360]   reality of the spiritual realm and of the presence of God.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   Something indescribable.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.160]   You can't describe these things.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.800]   You can simply give an account of them in that way.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.400]   Well, now this can happen to us individually, and by the grace of God it does happen to
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.880]   us individually.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.560]   So there is praying and praying.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.000]   All I'm saying is this, that if you know anything about this praying in the Spirit,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.560]   it is because you are born again, because you have been born of the Spirit.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.520]   And this is the thing that the New Testament is always exhorting us to.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.600]   Don't be content, it seems to be saying, with the ordinary level.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.800]   Don't be content in doing it as men.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.400]   Do it in the Spirit.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.000]   Rely upon the Spirit.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.040]   Look to the Spirit.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.560]   The same applies to preaching.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.760]   The same applies to every single activity in the Christian life.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.880]   And the test, therefore, is our awareness of our dependence upon him.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.160]   And so we seek him.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.240]   And so we pray to him.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.600]   Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.400]   Let thy bright beams arise.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.440]   Well the darkness from our minds and open all our eyes.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.920]   That kind of prayer.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.000]   You realize, you see that without him you can't do these things properly.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.320]   Breathe on me, breath of God.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:26.920]   Fill me with life anew, that I may love what thou dost love and do what thou wouldst do.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   That's it.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.240]   Do you know anything about that kind of longing?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.840]   You feel that you're lifeless, you feel that you're dead.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.000]   These are all experiences that God's people have to go through.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.880]   We are still in the flesh.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:46.000]   And this interrelationship between the body and the mind and the Spirit, it's a very rare
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.040]   and a very subtle thing.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.640]   And because of physical conditions at times, we feel lifeless.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.520]   There's no life in us.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:00.000]   We have to drag ourselves, as it were, through our duties in this matter.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.120]   It's right that we should do so.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.640]   Don't sit down, I say, and wait for something to happen.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.280]   Go on, but don't rely upon your going on.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.200]   Turn to him and pray to him.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.680]   Breathe on me, breath of God.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.960]   Fill me with life anew.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   That's it.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:28.920]   That I may love what thou dost love and do what thou wouldst do.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:37.000]   And so, this man, you see, he knows that nothing is right until that is true of him.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.560]   And so he's aware of this profound dependence upon the Holy Spirit, who is his partner,
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   cooperator.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.000]   He's in fellowship with him.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.520]   He's in partnership with him.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.240]   He's doing business with him, if you like.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.400]   And he is the senior partner.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.200]   Without him, we rarely can do nothing.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.640]   That's the kind of thing.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   And then let me put it in another way.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.320]   That we are aware, therefore, of his activities within us.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   I put it in general by saying that we are aware of the other and of his influence, but
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.800]   I want to mention certain particular activities of his inner life.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.320]   The Spirit is in us.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.920]   You can't be a Christian without having the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.320]   I'm not talking about the baptism with the Spirit.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:28.280]   I'm talking about having the Spirit within you, as the disciples had him before the day
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   of Pentecost.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.560]   Our Lord breathed on them in the upper room and said, "Receive ye the Spirit."
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.720]   That was several days before the day of Pentecost, when he came upon them in the form of the
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.840]   baptism to give them power.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   I'm talking now about the Christian born again has the Spirit in him.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.960]   And he's aware of the workings and the activities of the Spirit within him.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.840]   What the baptism does is to make him still more aware.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.280]   He heightens the awareness.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   What are these activities?
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.640]   Well, take the promptings of the Spirit.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.720]   Look at it again as expressed by Paul in Philippians 2, "Work out your own salvation in fear and
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:15.560]   trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.480]   It is God that worketh in you.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.160]   Now I put that under the headings of promptings.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.520]   And here is the test, you see, we apply to ourselves.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.440]   It's again just an elaboration of this point that you're not doing it all yourself.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.800]   Religion is not something that you have in a bag and you pull it up and use it, put it
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   back again.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   That's not it.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.400]   That's just religion.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.320]   Now here is a man who is aware of promptings.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.480]   Quite apart from his decisions.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:51.120]   You know, one of the most dangerous things in the spiritual life is a timetable.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.640]   There are loose ends in the spiritual life of necessity because it's life in the Spirit.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.920]   I've illustrated that often to you in the writings of the Apostle Paul, how the pundits
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.360]   get annoyed with him for breaking the rules of grammar and breaking into a new thought
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   halfway through a sentence and forgetting what he'd started to say and so on.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.240]   That's the Spirit.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.040]   But the others are so nice and neat and tidy.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.880]   They talk about turning a beautiful phrase or something.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.840]   Oh, that's literature.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.160]   That's not preaching.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.160]   That's not Christianity and that's no good.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.320]   No, no, here is this dynamic power of the Spirit and he breaks in upon us and all our
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:35.880]   timetables and he urges us and he moves us and he stimulates us.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.360]   The prayer, to Bible study, to meditation about these things.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.320]   You see, this only happens to the man who is born out of the Spirit.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.520]   It is the partner dealing with us.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.160]   You see, his desire is to bring us to that ultimate perfection so he won't leave us
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   alone.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.360]   You see, there's the hymn again that puts it, but he didn't mean the same thing.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.240]   He was further back in experience, but it's equally true at every level in this experience.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.520]   Oh, love that wilt not let me go.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.360]   Because one's almost annoyed with him.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.520]   One wants to be doing something else, but he keeps on interfering, prompting, urging.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.040]   And one resists, one fights with him.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   That's it.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   The very fighting is a proof of the fact that you know that he's there and you know what
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.920]   you're doing.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.960]   And you feel what a fool in the cab you are afterwards and you mourn as William Cowper
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   did.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.440]   But here it is, an awareness of these promptings.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.680]   Oh, let me put it a stage beyond that.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.720]   Not only promptings, but leadings and guidance.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.400]   Here's a great theme.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   I can't go into it.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.040]   I'm simply giving you some headings this morning.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:53.440]   But there is nothing which is plainer in the New Testament than the way in which these
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:00.280]   Christian people, these early Christians particularly, were led and were guided by the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.040]   Let me give you an example or two.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.120]   You remember Philip, who had been preaching in Samaria.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.240]   He was told, "The angel of the Lord speak unto Philip saying, Arise and go toward the
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.880]   south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is desert."
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.200]   And he went.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:24.480]   And then we read this, that there was another man, this Ethiopian, this eunuch of great
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.600]   authority under the queen of the Ethiopians.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.040]   He was returning from Jerusalem and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.960]   And this is what I read.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:42.760]   Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.800]   And Philip ran into him.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   But here's the point.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.920]   The Spirit said unto Philip.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.480]   He didn't just decide, "Oh, I wonder what that man's doing there.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.160]   I think I perhaps better go and have a word with him."
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   Not at all.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.640]   The Spirit said unto Philip.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.560]   And Philip knew it was the Spirit.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.320]   There was no difficulty about understanding this.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.200]   This is what I call a leading.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.000]   Or take what we read of the church at Antioch in Acts 13.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.820]   Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.120]   It gives their names.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:21.660]   And we read, "As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.640]   me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.800]   That wasn't an audible voice.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.440]   But they were all absolutely certain that it was the Holy Spirit who had spoken to them.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.680]   And so they put it like that.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:41.960]   The Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   them.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.520]   But if you want a still more striking one, go to the 16th chapter of the book of the
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.080]   Acts of the Apostles in verses 6 and 7.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.160]   And this is what you read.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.760]   Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, this is Paul and
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.080]   his travelling companions, remember.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:05.320]   When they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia and were forbidden of
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.240]   the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:15.280]   After they had come to Mycenae, they are said to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   them not.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.720]   Now there you've got this contrast stated very perfectly.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.960]   They decided to go.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.080]   They purposed to go.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.340]   They even assayed to go.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.480]   But they were not allowed to go.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.000]   They were forbidden of the Holy Ghost.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   The Spirit suffered them not.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.160]   Now this just means this, that here are spiritual men who are in such fellowship with the Holy
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.360]   Spirit that they know both when he tells them to do something and when he tells them not
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.760]   to do something.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.080]   And you get the contrast between the natural men's thinking.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.720]   Paul was a great man and a great genius and it seemed to him that the right thing to do
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.120]   was to go and preach the word in Asia.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.280]   It seemed obvious from where he was.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.760]   It seemed to be the next step.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.360]   He's not allowed to do it and he knows, he's sufficiently sensitive to know that this is
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   not the will of the Spirit.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.040]   Then he says, "Well, very well, if I'm not to go there, well obviously I'm meant to go
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.400]   here, Mycenae and Bithynia."
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.800]   But the Spirit suffered them not and we are told later of course why it was.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.080]   And they passed by Mysia, passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:31.040]   The point was that the Spirit's plan was that Paul should come to Europe, should go to Philippi.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.560]   So he stops him going here, he stops him going there, there's only one thing left, he's got
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.860]   to go straight on.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.720]   And he comes to Troas and he doesn't know why he's there.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:45.400]   And in the night you remember he has the vision of the men from Macedonia and then he understands.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:51.040]   But he didn't at first, but he was so sensitive to the presence and the working and the leadings
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:57.560]   of the Spirit that he knew the prohibition on the right hand and on the left and he gives
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.080]   obedience to this.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.200]   Well you get this same thing running right through.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:07.600]   The Apostle Paul bidding farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus in this lyrical account
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:13.360]   of it given in Acts 20, he says in verse 23, he says I'm going up to Jerusalem bound in
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:19.200]   the Spirit not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:25.320]   in every city saying the bonds and afflictions abide me.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.160]   The Holy Spirit was witnessing through the people.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.320]   He was giving them this understanding and they were able to tell the Apostle these things.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.520]   In Acts 21 for it's still more specific.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.120]   He arrives again in another place and I read in finding disciples we carried there seven
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:49.680]   days who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   Well now here it is, leadings and guidance of the Spirit and as you read the literature
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.920]   of the lives of the saints of the centuries you will find their increasing sensitivity
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:08.480]   to this and indeed some of them have arrived at a stage in which they would scarce move
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.640]   apart from this.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.280]   It can be carried to excess but the question I'm putting to you my friends is this.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:21.480]   Are we aware of this leading, this guidance, this partnership, the communion, the fellowship
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.400]   of the Holy Spirit?
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.280]   And we are so aware of him that we are aware of this leading and this guidance.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:38.480]   And then think of the way in which he can give us special and unusual power and authority
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.240]   to perform various tasks which he himself has allotted to us.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.680]   Here is another very wonderful test.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.400]   The test of power, the power of the Spirit.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.800]   You get this in many many places.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.840]   Let me give you but one instance in order to illustrate what I mean.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.400]   Take this story that we are given in the fourth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:07.920]   how the Apostles Peter and John were arrested and were arraigned before the court in Jerusalem,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:13.120]   the Sanhedrin, because of their healing of the man who was born lame who was placed at
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.720]   the beautiful gate of the temple and as a result of their preaching likewise.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.480]   They were arrested and they were put on trial.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.240]   And now this is what one reads here.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.600]   The authorities speak first of all and they say by what power or by what name have ye
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.520]   done this?
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:35.280]   Then Peter held with the Holy Ghost sat under them.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.000]   Now don't misunderstand that.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.480]   Many people misunderstand that.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.320]   They say a man's only filled with the Holy Spirit once.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.400]   Some say that that happens to everybody at regeneration.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.200]   Others say that that had happened only once to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.120]   But you see it goes on being repeated.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.740]   You can be filled with the Holy Spirit like this many many times over.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.040]   And these people clearly were.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.520]   What happens, what it means is this.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:09.120]   Here is Peter in this difficult situation fighting in a sense for his life and that
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.960]   of John and of the whole church, fighting for the whole future of the Christian faith.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   It's a most serious and momentous occasion.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.000]   And no doubt Peter was acutely aware of his inadequacy.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.120]   But he's a man who has been filled with the Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.320]   He knows the realm now in which he is dwelling and his dependence upon the Spirit.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.840]   And there is no doubt that he uttered up a prayer that he might be guided aright.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.800]   And what happens is he is filled with the Spirit.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.720]   And he's given words of wisdom, words of understanding.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.880]   He's given power, he's given authority.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.960]   It impressed these authorities when he spoke.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.240]   We are told when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.440]   unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.160]   And they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.880]   Yes, but you see, they were wrong.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.560]   They were right in the sense that they knew that they had been with Jesus.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:08.800]   But remember, these same apostles had been with Jesus when they denied him at the time
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.400]   of the crucifixion.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.880]   The mere being with Jesus doesn't explain the boldness of these men.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.840]   It's only the beginning of the explanation.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.760]   Peter had been with Jesus for the three years when he denied him to that servant girl at
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.440]   the trial and denied him with oaths and cursing.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.240]   Oh, he'd been with Jesus.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.760]   That's not the explanation.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   These authorities are wrong.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.600]   It's the introduction to what?
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.800]   Well, being with Jesus, eventually believing in him, having his own explanation of his
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:48.680]   death and resurrection, told Kateri in Jerusalem, then the baptism with the Holy Spirit and
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.000]   the knowledge of this spiritual realm, the fulfillment of the promise that the Spirit
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   shall be in you.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.680]   He knows this now.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:02.720]   And therefore, he realizes his need and he turns to him and he's filled with this clarity,
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.960]   this understanding, this power of speech, this ordering of his speech and language,
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.240]   this presentation of his case.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.520]   He speaks filled with the Spirit.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.560]   And you go on through the book of the Acts of the Apostles and keep your eye on that
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.640]   and you'll find that it is something that was constantly repeated whenever these men
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.360]   are called to work a miracle.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.880]   You generally get this phrase, "filled with the Spirit."
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:34.840]   And this is something that all of us should know in experience, an ability given, an understanding
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   given.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.720]   I've already mentioned it in reading the Scriptures, but in speaking to others, a word
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:46.960]   of wisdom and of understanding, the knowing of how to present yourself and your case,
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:55.800]   and this whole matter, this power, this authority, this freedom that the Holy Spirit of God alone
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.400]   can give where the Spirit of the Lord is.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.320]   There is liberty.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:07.040]   We all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.600]   same image from glory to glory by the Spirit.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.800]   It's the power of the activity of the Spirit upon us.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.320]   Well now there, and we must leave it at that for this morning, there are some of these
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:32.160]   ways in which we can know that we know the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.520]   That's the Christian life.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.920]   Not a man in his own strength trying to do something painfully, wearily as a matter of
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   duty.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.280]   No, no, life from the Spirit.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.800]   The Spirit entering in, giving him life anew, working in him, leading, guiding, prompting,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.440]   giving power and authority and understanding.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.920]   But above all, an awareness of himself.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.600]   Now says our Lord to Nicodemus, "Now you see you're asking me questions as to how I work
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.680]   miracles and preach as I do.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:09.640]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, ye must be born again.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:18.840]   For a man who is not born again cannot see the kingdom of God, except a man be born of
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.120]   water and of the Spirit.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.960]   He cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:32.360]   So realizing our utter nothingness and our complete helplessness, we abandon ourselves
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:39.000]   to him and offer the prayer, "Breathe on me breath of God.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:48:01.840]   Fill me with life anew that I may love what thou dost love and do what thou wouldst do."
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:22.540]   If you have any questions or comments, please post them in the comments section below.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:33.540]   Thank you.
