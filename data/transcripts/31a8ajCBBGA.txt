[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   I'm going to try to describe the relationship of your new book to your last book, 4,000
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.520]   Weeks, then you tell me how you would modify that.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.560]   Because I don't see it as, it's not quite right to say a follow-up to 4,000 Weeks.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.480]   It's not quite right to say a response to 4,000 Weeks.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.440]   I see it as maybe a companion/elaboration/iteration.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.480]   There's new things in it and it's more practical, but it also has a lot of philosophy.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.840]   And some of the philosophy is refining what you talked about in 4,000 Weeks and some of
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.040]   the philosophy is also new, which gives it a really interesting relationship.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.760]   Am I getting that sort of vaguely right?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.120]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.860]   I mean, it was very important to me writing it that it not be something that required
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.840]   you to have read a word I've written beforehand.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.320]   But I think there is, you know, on one level, my subject matter is human finitude, limitation,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.560]   how we get things done and enjoy life in this situation of being as limited as we are.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:07.200]   And I guess the focus of this book is much more, in my mind, on action at a day-to-day
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.420]   level and really going from, you know, going from the fact that you can have all sorts
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.800]   of ideas about how you want to live and work and never actually do them.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.380]   So it's about crossing that gap into sort of actually doing the things.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.440]   Which is kind of where things get exciting.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.560]   So let's back up a little bit.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.720]   So what I wanted to start, my goal, and we talked about this offline, my goal is to try
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.800]   to understand, this is a show about the deep life, what role does productivity play in
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   the deep life?
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.240]   That's going to be our goal, including, and I think that's why I'm glad you're here,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.240]   the traps.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   There's a lot of dangers as you try to integrate productivity ideas into your life.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   There's a lot of traps there.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   So let's start from the beginning.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.080]   I want to try to identify better what it is you are responding to with both this book
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.340]   and 4,000 Weeks.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.520]   Because I think something that's different about you than other writers from the last
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.800]   five years who have had some skepticism about productivity culture is, you know about what
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.040]   you speak.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   You wrote this column for The Guardian, I think I counted over 600 columns or 400,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.880]   I don't know, I counted at some point, but it was over a decade, right?
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   >> Too many, yeah.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   >> Too many, yeah.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.960]   So you wrote a column that looked at advice culture, self-help culture, productivity culture
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.280]   for a very long time before you came to these books.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.720]   So what was it that you came to notice that led you to the motivation to start writing
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.200]   skeptically about this culture?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.240]   >> Yes, I mean, one of the great benefits of writing a column for a long time where
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.380]   you get to, among other things, you know, test out all these methods and systems and
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.040]   techniques is that, you know, once you've tried a hundred of them and none of them have
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.600]   been the silver bullet that brings total peace of mind and calm productivity to your life,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.400]   you begin to ask the next question, which is whether there's something amiss with that
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   quest.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.600]   Obviously, if you do a more important job in the world and you only have the time to
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.680]   test out a handful of these, you might still believe that it's just a question of finding
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   the right system.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.640]   So I really feel like I went through a very kind of productive and positive kind of disillusionment
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.200]   in that process.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   >> How earnest, I read your original column the other day, and there's an earnestness
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   in it.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.480]   Like, I really do want to try to figure out what works.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.000]   And then there was also, I think, a very British sort of self-deprecation of it as well.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.200]   But how earnest, like if you're looking back at 2006, what would, if I interviewed you
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.720]   back then, what were you hoping, did you, at that point, were you holding out a significant
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.160]   piece is going to be found, or were you already pretty suspect?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.720]   Because the column had a bit of a sardonic title, I'm very curious in where your mindset
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.280]   was back then when you started.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   >> It's interesting, I think of the process of writing that column over the years as being
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.440]   a journey from cynicism to sincerity, really, even though as well disillusionment in the
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.840]   ways that were being offered to sort of build a meaningful life.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.520]   But the, you know, I think I began thinking I was mainly going to sort of be mocking and
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.920]   sarcastic about terrible self-help, still taking the sort of quest for happiness seriously
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.120]   on some level, because it is obviously on some level a very serious quest.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:34.720]   But the big surprise was how much value there was like hiding in the cheesiness and the
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   cringe.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.400]   That was also a much more interesting and provocative thing to present to the archetypal
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.760]   Guardian reader, right?
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.360]   My audience was, I took my audience anyway to be similarly jaded and skeptical.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.840]   So that sort of obviously is at odds with what I just said about getting disillusioned
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   by the methods.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.400]   But I think the sort of, so it was a sort of a twin track thing where I gradually was
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.640]   sort of forced into having different or my own ideas about how to get to these goals.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.560]   But I did get more sincere about the goals.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.300]   And I think what's going on there partly obviously is that when you start that thing off and
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.880]   when you start writing sardonically about stuff as a relatively young adult, part of
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.280]   what you're doing is sort of a bit of a defense mechanism against the fact that you do care
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.080]   about these things and you would like to find ways to be less anxious and feel less oppressed
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.320]   by obligation and overwhelm.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.940]   But it's kind of a little bit embarrassing to admit it.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.200]   So you do sarcastic stuff instead.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.080]   Do journalists have a like a special relationship with these type of topics like productivity?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.160]   Because it's a weird job.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.840]   It's very autonomous in some sense.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.440]   It's also very deadline driven.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.960]   There's an unlimited ceiling it feels like.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.600]   You can go, you can advance to become as famous or as successful as you can imagine or anywhere
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   along the way.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   And it all kind of comes down to what you're going to do and you're all sort of starting
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.120]   from the same place and everyone's, you have to find some way to break out.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   It feels like journalism, maybe similar to like academia, has a special relationship
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.360]   to this advice because they worry a lot about the things that this advice promises to help.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.080]   Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.520]   And I was sort of doubling that up by then the substance of what I was writing about
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.440]   was this stuff as well.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.640]   But yeah, that kind of deadline driven environment where you are a part of a collective operation
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.600]   and getting the pages filled physically or digitally is the ultimate sort of driving
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   goal.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.920]   But yeah, it's really sort of individualistic in another way.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.160]   Everyone inside that organization, who's a writer anyway, is sort of fiercely on some
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.220]   level competing with each other.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:53.000]   And it feels like it really matters to find the most effective and efficient ways to deal
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.280]   with each project so you can get on to the next bigger one, I suppose.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.600]   Yeah, it's in the water there.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.560]   So then what was, when you had the revelation, and you talk about in your last book, it was
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.400]   on a bench famously in Brooklyn.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.120]   How do you describe the revelation you had that led to 4,000 weeks?
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.560]   Well, this was very much an intellectual kind of revelation.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.960]   And the process with me, I don't know if it's, I think it's probably quite common, is that
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.040]   I have these kind of what seemed like incredibly clarifying intellectual insights.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.840]   And then it can take years and years to kind of live into a new way of living.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.680]   My intellect goes first, and then the rest of me has to catch up.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.780]   But I was, yeah, I tell this story, I was, I'd stopped to sit on a park bench on my way
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.400]   to my co-working space in Brooklyn where we lived.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.160]   And I just had even more article deadlines and stuff I was supposed to do by the end
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.920]   of that week than I usually had.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.720]   I was even more anxious about it all, cycling through what combination of productivity tricks
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.220]   and total suspension of my social life or sleep I was going to use to try to force my
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.120]   way through to state of completion on this stuff.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.880]   And just being struck really powerfully by the thought, oh, it's impossible.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.720]   I'm trying to do something that isn't possible here.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.760]   I'm trying to do more things than there will be a way to do in the time available.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.280]   And just experiencing that as just incredibly liberating as opposed to depressing, right?
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.440]   That moment of I'm trying to do something that isn't on the cards.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.480]   So actually, the very best thing I can do is to pick some of the things that seem like
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.680]   the best use of my time and energy and do them and instantly like you're sort of not
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.440]   overwhelmed in that moment because the whole conceptual structure of overwhelm kind of
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   operates.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.400]   Did you take things off your plate right after that?
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.080]   Like, was this a matter of saying no to some things or backing out of some things?
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.040]   What was the practical implications on your workload in that moment?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.980]   I think in that moment, a lot of it was just a little bit of renegotiation of existing
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.800]   deadlines, facing up to the risk of people being furious with me and of course finding
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.160]   out that they've got their own problems.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.240]   They were not pacing up and down their offices cursing my name and didn't really mind at
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   all taking a bit of extra time.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.680]   I don't remember in detail, but I think there might well have been a project or two that
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.000]   I had to essentially put on ice.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.840]   And then, the rest of it is, it's almost like it wasn't even real in some sense, right?
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.740]   It's like, yes, I've got a lot of emails that need answering on some value of need answering.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.880]   But if it takes, in a lot of those cases, if you sort of triage them and some of them
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   maybe you'd never reply to and some of them, yeah, it's going to take two weeks.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.320]   It's not particularly proud of that, but it's not going to bring catastrophe.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.400]   And there's the depth of the sort of unexamined idea that something absolutely terrible is
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   going to happen if you don't get to the end of a sort of purely, on some level, self-created
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.800]   list of tasks is extraordinary.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.000]   We have this joke on the show that people like to imagine there's a dark room somewhere
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.640]   where all the people you work with are sitting around and they have all this data about you
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.560]   up on a board somewhere and they're studying your patterns of like, how many things did
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.240]   Oliver say no to?
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   Wait a second.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.800]   He said no to 50% more things than normal.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.280]   And what's his average response time?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.400]   They're all caring about this and no one cares.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.160]   And how, I mean, you know, how weirdly insulting to the people involved, right?
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.800]   It's like, you know, when I, I was saying this to my editor at the publisher just the
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.100]   other day, right?
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.100]   Not that I suffer from this like I used to, but when I'm late with a deadline or something,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:50.340]   there is this sort of involuntary mental image that this, you know, busy, high status person
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.540]   with lots on their plate is doing nothing but just sort of sitting around thinking bad
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.540]   thoughts about me.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:03.740]   How dare he, you know, they're all sitting around, yeah, with sifters of Sherry, yeah.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.700]   And look, obviously that there's a certain factor here, whether people are in different
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.500]   situations and there are genuinely people who are in a sort of tighter spot than me
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.300]   in terms of, it's a part of a job requirement to answer every email from a certain person
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.220]   or kind of person in a certain time scale.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.940]   And so these trade-offs can be different.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.820]   And I've got a certain amount of good fortune in this very sort of autonomous life.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:35.300]   But even in those cases, the sort of existential layer that people bring to it, like then they
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.100]   have not earned their right to exist on the planet if they don't power through all the
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.100]   things.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.380]   I think that is something we can all let go of.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.380]   Okay.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.780]   So you have this insight.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.780]   So walk us through the response.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:54.300]   So once you recognize you can't do it all, there's a, I mean, I think you used the word
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   futility.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:01.700]   There's a futility to the idea that you can get it all organized, right?
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.540]   Like am I saying this right that people have this idea that there's this, this group of
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.940]   things you need to do to be successful.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.740]   And it's, it's maybe a little bit outside of what you could do comfortably, but if you
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.260]   just get your systems right, you can tackle it and you'll be successful.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.420]   But the reality you write about is no, no, there's a vast universe of things you could
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.420]   be doing.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.920]   No matter how organized you are, most things you're not going to do.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.740]   So why have that epsilon of that like extra 20 exhaustive percent?
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.300]   Does it really make much of a difference in terms of how much you're getting done?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   Not really.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.580]   You're saying no to, to any ways, if I have that right.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.620]   Well, first of all, do I have that right?
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.620]   Am I thinking about that?
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.620]   Right?
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.940]   I think one way that sort of resonates a lot with me is that it's about a certain kind
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.940]   of feeling of, of control, right?
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:51.580]   It's about, it's about wanting to feel all these phrases like on top of everything or
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.380]   like you have your life sorted out or something like that.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:04.300]   And it's the, the problem with that whole approach is, is that, that sort of the point
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.660]   at which that feeling of control would be satisfied.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.060]   Is, is essentially when you had your arms around an incident.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.340]   So before we get too far into, okay, so now how do we rewire our mindset and then what
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.220]   practically we can do from the new book?
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:23.660]   I'm curious in the relationship between your ideas and critiques and what I think is the
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.980]   other main line of productivity critiques the last five years, which I would, I guess
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:37.020]   I would characterize as like the Ginny O'Dell, maybe, and Helen Peterson camp.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.260]   That's much more of a, an economic critique.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:45.700]   I think more of like a classic Marxist critique, which says, okay, these productivity mindsets
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.660]   that are sort of causing issues that you also talk about are essentially implanted by the
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.660]   imperatives of capitalism.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.660]   It's more of a Marxist critique that these are, it's a mindset that's been implanted
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.060]   to try to exploit labor.
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.340]   Your critiques seem very different.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.700]   They seem more psychological than economical.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.720]   But how do you, how do you think about the relationship between your critiques and the,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.100]   the other kind of big names that have been critiquing productivity in the last few years?
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.820]   Yeah, it's such an interesting question because I, I do appreciate the best of that work so
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:26.420]   much at the same time as kind of feeling that I diverge from it.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:33.020]   For me, it starts with an issue of like my personality, really, at the end of the day.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:43.140]   I want to try to salvage the idea of productive ambition within the kind of context that we,
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.140]   that we live.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.500]   I'm not sort of drawn to the revolutionary implications of that more sort of Marxist
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   critique.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.300]   So I'm just like, okay, I would really like to have much more peace of mind.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.940]   There's me coming into this and to some extent still today, right?
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.940]   I would like to have much more peace of mind and calm, but I would like that not to be
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:10.980]   a kind of checking out of, of accomplishment society and, and, and launching cool stuff
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.660]   and making some money out of it and all the rest of it.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.900]   So I'm sort of trying to reconcile those things for myself.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.860]   The question then I suppose is whether that can be done or whether sort of consistency
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.660]   requires you to eventually end up in that, in that Marxist camp.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.340]   And then at the end of the day, I just sort of think, well, look, I'm, I feel like I'm
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:36.300]   writing for people who get up in the morning and have a to-do list and have stuff they
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.860]   want to achieve and stuff that they feel pressured to do and, and all the rest of it.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.700]   So maybe in a sense, it's just like while we're waiting for the revolution, what can
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.700]   we do?
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.980]   You know, because I absolutely think that there's a legitimate criticism to be made
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:57.140]   of what I do, which is that it sort of puts the social economic critique to one, to one
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:04.860]   side and, and, and doesn't very much address it head on and sort of says, that's all very
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.860]   well.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.020]   But at the same time, here we are as individuals trying to sort of live flourishing lives right
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.020]   here.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:18.220]   So I guess it's just the standard critique from the revolutionary is don't distract.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:23.020]   Don't distract the masses with practicality because you will turn their mind away from
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.020]   revolution.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.700]   But, but actually it's, it's a very healthy tension that it's good to have the pressure
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:33.020]   on the world of work and capitalism, but you also have to be helping individuals, as you
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.500]   say, who right now feel completely overwhelmed and don't know what to do.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.620]   And capitalism is probably not going to fall this year.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Right.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.060]   And I'm being a little bit unfair in talking about revolution, right?
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.260]   There's a completely legitimate version of this that says what really matters is family
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:56.020]   friendly healthcare systems and childcare systems and all sorts of other aspects.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.200]   And if we have that, then a lot of these kind of bad tensions that we feel in our work and
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.740]   our productivity might not arise.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.180]   But again, you know, the response is, yep, totally.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.700]   And meanwhile, uh, I, what, what should we do?
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:16.300]   I think an interesting place where maybe I'm closer to those writers than you is something
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:22.700]   that I think the, those writers in me are very interested in is the kind of boring details
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.580]   of knowledge work.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.380]   Like how does knowledge work function?
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.180]   How does management happen in knowledge work?
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.860]   How does work flow?
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.300]   Like what's the structure of a typical job where you work at a computer and you go to
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.780]   a cubicle or this or that?
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.820]   Um, and I'm interested and I want to get your opinion on this because it feels like there's,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.860]   there's two different rel relevant forces that are both a source of people's exhaustion
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.020]   with the idea of productivity.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.700]   One is the psychological, which, which I think you talk about very well, the, the pressure
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.940]   you put upon yourself to figure it out, have the best systems, you know, get it all done,
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.100]   piece through productivity.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.060]   Then there is what's happening in the workplace.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.220]   So it's like what I write about in my last book, pseudo productivity, um, the rise of
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.460]   the managerial strategy of using visible activity as a proxy for useful effort.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:19.380]   Um, the impossibility of that, it's almost as it's an institutionalization of, I think
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.420]   the feudal mindsets that you talk about in your book as ultimately being a nihilistic
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.980]   and you're never going to, you're never going to get your arms around everything.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.340]   Um, and yet the modern workplace has these pressures of activities, what matters.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.020]   So more is better than less.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.020]   And any moment where you could be working and you're not, you're actually having a personal
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.540]   negotiation and having to balance your life against work.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.100]   And it's just like impossible sort of balance you have.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   I mean, so how do you, how do we think about the world of work?
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.460]   Like what is its contribution to this exhaustion that people feel with productivity and, and
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.820]   how's that overlap with the way you talk about it?
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.460]   Wow, that's an interesting question.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:04.180]   And, and I think you're right that it's something that connects you with the, um, we might say
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.820]   more radical productivity critique in some way.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.860]   And the main difference I always say is they think, uh, the world of work is doing it on
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.060]   purpose to exploit and get more labor.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.060]   And I say, no, no, no, the managers in the role of knowledge work have no idea what they're
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.060]   doing.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.340]   It's, it's a dumpster fire.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.500]   It's random and everyone's running around and actually it makes people very unproductive.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.940]   It doesn't create value.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.940]   It's not, it's not like getting the longer hours out of the assembly line worker or it's
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.100]   bad for the worker, but you build Model T's cheaper.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.780]   I was like, actually the way we work in knowledge work is chaotic.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.780]   It exhausts people.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.780]   It's unproductive.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.980]   It's bad for the organization.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.380]   It's more ignorant and not understanding how knowledge work works.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.940]   That's the main place we differ, but we both see, I guess, the world of work as being a
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.820]   big force of productivity negativity.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.820]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.780]   And listen, I don't dispute that at all.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.900]   I just, I think the only answer I have really is that, is that, yeah, I am coming, I think,
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:04.040]   from this somewhat more psychological place where I'm asking like how one confronts the
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.100]   reality with which one is faced each day.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.540]   One big part of which is obviously, you know, organizational life and the office and, and
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.740]   how, and how work works.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:20.100]   So one place where this comes up is, is in sort of the question of how much autonomy
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:26.020]   you need in your work situation to benefit from the things that I'm saying, the things
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.380]   that you're saying, things that anybody's saying.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.340]   And, and I think one place that I go in this new book is almost in a sort of existentialist
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.060]   philosophy direction, right?
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:41.620]   To look at the kind of the, the choices that we retain, even in situations where we're,
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:47.660]   where we're very much sort of our actions are guided by these kinds of, as you say,
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.980]   probably in many ways, largely irrational and counterproductive ways of approaching
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.980]   work.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   So, yeah.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.020]   I think they're just different, different angles on the same material.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.940]   It's not a very, not a very good answer on some level.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.500]   Well, one of the things I like about the way you talk about, and you even said this earlier
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.420]   in this interview, and I think it's a good point for me, and I think it's something that
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.940]   my audience really likes about you, is that I think you're pointing out that some non-trivial
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:21.220]   percent of what people in a normal office job feel like is unavoidable and put upon
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.940]   them by their managers is actually in their mind.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.180]   Which I think is really interesting that we tell a story of everyone is demanding this
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:35.140]   email to be answered and everyone is demanding, I say, yes, and if not in the control center,
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.700]   they're going to notice this and start getting upset.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.260]   And I think that's a really important point that even in knowledge work, which does put
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.980]   these weird productivity pressures, we amplify it in our head.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.980]   Right.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.980]   Absolutely.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.940]   And if you go sort of, if you zoom out or up or something from that far enough, you
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.580]   get to this kind of question of what it means to be a human facing options and choices in
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.980]   the world that sort of dissolves the boundary between the work setting and the rest of life
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.260]   because it applies to the whole of life.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:11.660]   And in one of the chapters in this book, I talk about this quotation from the therapist
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.860]   Sheldon Copp who says, "You're free to do whatever you like.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.580]   You need only face the consequences."
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.380]   And it's this whole sort of vision of the world, which is absolutely on point, I think,
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:27.740]   for finite human beings, where every single thing that you feel you have to do is really
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:33.780]   a question of saying you're not prepared, perhaps quite wisely, to shoulder, to pay
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.500]   the costs of not doing it, right?
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.420]   That's always the only question at hand.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.780]   And I think, you know, there's a terrible cliched version of self-help that says you
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.900]   can always choose anything and you've got no limits on your autonomy at all.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.260]   And just like by thinking about large piles of gold, you can become a billionaire.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.700]   But there's another, the more sort of, as I say, existentialist idea of choice, which
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:01.060]   is like, actually, it's never, unless you're under physical restraint, I suppose, it's
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:06.040]   never literally the case that you have to do anything.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:13.340]   It's always the case that you're choosing which disadvantages to put up with, the disadvantages
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.480]   of submitting to those pressures of the workplace or not doing.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.660]   And that can be very, very obvious for some people, right?
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.140]   Like, I've got to do that, otherwise I get fired.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:28.540]   But there's something important in terms of one's sense of oneself in the world, there's
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.660]   something very important about seeing that it is still technically a choice.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.740]   Even if to take one of the options would be kind of totally insane and you'd never do
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.740]   it.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.340]   The fact that you could means something.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.340]   Right.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.700]   You could, there's nothing stopping you from saying, I'm not answering emails, or I'm just
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   going to say, no, I don't want to do this type of projects anymore.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:56.500]   Like all this is that you're choosing sort of what your day-to-day is, and it might be
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.180]   a bad option, but you're not being forced to do anything.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.180]   Right.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.940]   And if you start from that sense in which your freedom of choice is sort of unlimited
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.980]   and you can say no, it's like, I would prefer not to, right?
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:15.420]   It's Bartleby the Scrivener as the key to modern productivity culture.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.700]   I'm not suggesting that most people are going to, or should, decide just to stop answering
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.060]   emails from people more senior to them in an organization, for example.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:30.420]   But just from once you see that, what we're getting at here, it then allows you to more
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:35.020]   consciously let back in the pressures you're going to submit to, the ones you're going
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:40.020]   to resist, and through that sort of process navigate to where you want to get to.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.340]   Well, I like this because it's compatible with what we talk about here on the show a
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.240]   lot about lifestyle planning.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.020]   So working backwards from an image of what makes a good life good, as opposed to like
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.940]   fixating on a singular grand goal and hoping this will fix everything, right?
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.820]   It's knowing like, what do I want my schedule to feel like?
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.820]   What do I want to live?
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.520]   What do I want the rhythm of my day to look like?
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.100]   You have a lot more options for sort of working in small steps and taking advantage of small
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.340]   opportunities to move towards an ideal lifestyle image.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:18.260]   There's a lot more options than you think versus I just want to be at the top of the
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.620]   pile and if I get there, then I'll be happy.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.140]   But I want to actually, so what I want to survey, I want to get your help on this, like
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:32.500]   I know a lot about the business world and its intersection with productivity.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.060]   Somewhat ironically, given that I write about this, I know very little about the other types
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:43.360]   of productivity culture, online, books, the way people talk about productivity when they
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.860]   actually are talking about productivity.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.660]   You know a lot about that world because you wrote this column for so long and you push
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.320]   back against that world in the books.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.940]   Can you give me like, what is this world saying?
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.940]   I don't use social media.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.460]   I'm not very online.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.780]   I don't read a lot of books in my own genre.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:05.560]   What is the non-corporate productivity self-help advice world?
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.560]   What is this?
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   Is it books?
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   Is it online?
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.180]   What are the core messages?
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:15.060]   How do we define this world that you were reacting to?
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:21.580]   I mean I think on some level it's getting more varied and multifarious, so I don't want
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.920]   to sort of totally caricature it.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:32.440]   But I do think that what you get in all of that, and I am familiar especially with what's
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:40.320]   going on in this world on YouTube and on Twitter, whatever it's called now, and to some extent
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.620]   this is there in the book world as well.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:53.780]   There is still this driving focus on the idea that there is one very simple way, obviously
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.360]   it's a totally different way depending on whose video you're watching, but there is
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.320]   one very simple way to, there's a rule of some kind, a system of some kind that if you
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:09.480]   follow it, everything will fall into place and it will be essentially automatic.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.100]   That you do an enormous amount, that it's the right stuff, and that you make huge amounts
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.180]   of money from it.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.700]   This is very YouTube, right?
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.700]   This feels very YouTube.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.700]   Yeah, no.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:26.660]   There's this extraordinary escalation in like, it starts off with like, how I make ten thousand
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.500]   dollars a month, and then you scroll through the videos and you're at like, how I make
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   ten million dollars a month.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.100]   And it's like, well, if you did, I don't think you'd be…
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.100]   And they're in front of a jet, right?
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.100]   Right, right, yeah, exactly.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.100]   On the thumbnail, right?
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.940]   So that's the sort of really money focused side of it.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.820]   But even when it's not really money focused, right, it has the same basic idea that there
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.660]   is something that will make it sort of plug and play.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.380]   And I think, for example, I know you say you're not so familiar with it, but I think this
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:59.940]   stuff, but I remember you talking about, in the world of, when it comes to writing, right,
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.380]   there's a version of this in the world of like, personal knowledge management and note
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.020]   taking and the great, very interesting writing that's been done on things like the idea of
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.420]   a Zettelkasten, which we probably don't need to get into now.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:16.220]   But again, sharing this notion that if you really do all this well, the bit where you're
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.220]   sitting down to write will be effortless, and you won't have to ever go through the
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.340]   difficult bit of like, I don't know what to write, I'm thinking.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:31.620]   And I think I'm quoting you all the time on writer's block, just being the feeling of
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.620]   writing.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.420]   So I'm seeing this maybe now with AI too, right?
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.380]   So now I think I am kind of plugged into what you're talking about, because I see this with
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.660]   AI a lot, just if you, there's a possibility.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.820]   And this is the exact same thing, by the way, that went on in the 2000s during the productivity
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:53.100]   prong period, where the idea was, if you're using technology in the new way to support
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.020]   your task systems, work will become effortless, right?
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.860]   And you would believe it, because this technology is new, so it's possible that there's some
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.860]   sort of new insight.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.860]   I'm seeing that now with AI.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.860]   Oh, totally.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:10.700]   So I have this, look, I have this like interactive, I built a custom LLM, and I talk to it, and
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.700]   there's, yeah, okay.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.820]   So now I think I'm plugged into what you're saying.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.540]   It's less about, sometimes productivity culture is characterized as like, well, there's all
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:23.100]   these books saying, do as much as possible or do more, but what you're saying is much
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.100]   more subtle.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.980]   No, no, it's not that the books are saying, do more.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.240]   It's there's a system that's going to cure you.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.880]   There's a system that's going to make the hard thing go away.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.460]   It's going to make life easy, like it's going to be cranking widgets.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.460]   Right, right.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.080]   And I want to say at least two things against this, right?
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.120]   One is that it, yeah, maybe three.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:51.160]   One is that this doesn't exist, that you're not going to define this thing.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.680]   But another is that you really wouldn't want it if you had it.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.400]   So first of all, if you put something like that in place, and it sort of works a bit,
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.720]   one of the things you find is this thing I've referred to elsewhere as the efficiency trap,
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   right?
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.680]   You find, even if an AI assistant can handle huge amounts of what you'd previously been
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.920]   handling, what do you think is going to happen to all that freed up bandwidth, right?
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.680]   It's just going to, all else being equal, it's just going to get filled with even more
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.760]   stuff for you to do.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:26.640]   But also, and I think this is where I, this is the new book in some ways, whoever thought
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:33.320]   that a life of cranking widgets isn't fun, and this idea that if you could sort of get
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:38.540]   everything running completely smoothly and not have to engage with problem after challenge
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.760]   after problem, that that would actually, this is my argument, that would actually be a much
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.240]   less rich and meaningful life.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.920]   So we are really capable of sort of, and this is, there's a quote from some game designer
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.040]   about this, right?
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.960]   People left to their own devices will optimize the fun out of the game.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.520]   And I think that's what we really are at risk of doing in productivity as well.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.200]   So I agree with you.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   You probably agree with me.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.080]   I think David Allen, he's so misunderstood.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.840]   Because the title of that book, Getting Things Done, makes people who just hear the title
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.000]   think it's a book about maximizing output or getting ahead.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   It's a dark book.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.820]   I keep telling people it's very nihilistic.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:28.040]   He wants to reduce work to just cranking widgets because he sees work as so stressful and anxiety
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.800]   producing and soul numbing.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.440]   He's like, I just don't want to be, feel this way anymore.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:39.520]   So can't we just make things into like automatic actions that you just do and you can just
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520]   disengage?
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.320]   I mean, it feels almost like something you would see, yeah, maybe from an existentialist
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.080]   writer or a nihilist writer from like the early 20th centuries or something.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.400]   I see it as a dark book.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.840]   I see it as a cry for help too.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.160]   It seemed like, look, the fact that we have people trying to figure out how to numb themselves
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.200]   to work means the world of work is broken.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.360]   Like you should see Getting Things Done and be like, okay, what's going on in knowledge
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.920]   work in the late 90s, early 2000s?
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.420]   But instead people see that title and think, oh, he's saying, yeah, if you can just do
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.520]   more, we're going to get ahead.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.840]   He doesn't want anyone to get ahead.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.960]   He's just trying to, he's numbing himself with task lists.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:17.120]   Can we just like take our mind, like just disconnect from this grimness that is knowledge
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   work?
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.240]   I have never really considered the dark version of GTD.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.120]   I do think it's misunderstood.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:33.920]   I tend to come at it from a somewhat less nihilistic perspective, I guess, about the
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:39.400]   book in the sense that like firstly, he's a little bit like Shakespeare or somebody
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.760]   and that there are ideas from that book that we just all completely use now and don't give
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   him credit for because they're-
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   JS: Full capture.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.440]   It's like a brilliant idea.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   Exactly.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:54.040]   And then the other thing is, yeah, I mean, in a way, and there is a whole kind of spiritual
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.080]   dimension to his life and biography, which is interesting, actually.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:03.800]   But like, in a way, this debate about whether it's positive or negative is a debate that
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.480]   goes through all sorts of kind of Eastern philosophies, right?
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.760]   Should you deal with the things that burden us in life by trying to sort of non-attach
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.920]   from them?
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   And then is that a recipe for kind of retreat from life or is that actually the way to plunge
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   into life?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.180]   So I think there's a positive reading of getting things done where sort of reducing everything
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:29.860]   to cranking widgets might then allow you to sort of be more fully present.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.400]   So maybe that will be a more positive reading.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   But you're right.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.400]   That may not be the case.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:41.600]   Is it about maximizing your capacity to move through as many tasks as possible?
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.860]   Certainly not that you might ever get to the end, to the end of them.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.720]   There was a, it was referenced, I went and looked this up the other day, getting things
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.560]   done was referenced in The Office, the American version of The Office.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:59.440]   The book was, they had one of the characters in the story arc was, he was trying to impress
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   the managers.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.680]   So he was trying to show that he was productive and he said, yeah, I've been reading this
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.820]   book, getting things done.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:12.320]   And I saved, it was something like, I saved 90 seconds this morning by like brushing my
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   teeth while I showered.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.240]   And he's like, and I just lost that 90 seconds explaining this to you, ah, shoot, or whatever.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.680]   I'm like, oh, that was the conception of getting things done, that it was somehow about, you
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.080]   know, if you brush your teeth in the shower, yeah, you're going to save more time.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.460]   I think of more of the archetypical, I like going back in memory lane.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.480]   This literature is very interesting to me.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.920]   Probably the archetypical book in my mind of you can get your arms around it all is
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.800]   maybe Stephen Covey, which was really trying to unify it's work, but your life outside
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.080]   of work.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.880]   Nothing about that book was about optimization.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.920]   I don't think anything about that book was about getting more, trying to get more done
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   than other people.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.400]   In fact, there's very few books that actually make the argument do more.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.700]   The closest one I can think of is maybe hyper productivity, which was, but that was like
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.700]   pretty pragmatic.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.500]   He's like, look, I'm an executive.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.260]   This is a stupidly hard job because you have to do 50 things.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.780]   Here's how I do it.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   Right.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.660]   But Stephen Covey seems like maybe the archetype of you could figure out what's important to
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:20.220]   you and then you can very carefully plan based on these visions of the roles and you're,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.260]   and making sure that your actions are aligned.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.740]   And there's a, there's a super optimism.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.740]   And I wrote about this in the New Yorker.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.380]   I did this whole history of time management and productivity books.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.100]   And I was like, that book reflected the optimism of the late eighties, you know, capitalism
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.300]   is booming.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.080]   All the baby boomers were doing well.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.420]   They all were buying houses.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.420]   Everyone was feeling pretty good.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.780]   And it was very optimistic.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.860]   Like you can, you can shape a really meaningful life with the right system.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.860]   Right.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:53.520]   And also the sort of especially digital connectivity is not yet at a place where the sort of challenge
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.940]   to that from what I think of as infinite inputs, right, has become, uh, evident, right?
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:04.420]   You're not going to feel, uh, you're not going to be suffering from this problem of just
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.180]   a completely unlimited incoming stream of emails or completely unlimited list of things
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.060]   you feel you want to read or opportunities to go play.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.060]   Right.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.420]   It's, it's, it's still sort of sheltered by the sort of lack of that kind of technology.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.380]   I mean, that's, that's the difference between Alan and Covey is email came along.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.960]   I mean, I think of Alan as entirely a response to the digital workplace and it went from
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   this optimism.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.720]   I have a couple of meetings during the day and maybe I'm going to like dictate a memo,
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.860]   which I'll give to the typing pool.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.140]   It went from that in 1989 to, oh my God, the stuff that's coming in.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.180]   Alan talks about in his book, working with clients or an intake process where like, let's
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.580]   just write down everything that you're, you have some sort of commitment to do or obligation.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.020]   And it would take, he said on average, like four to six hours.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.020]   Right.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.360]   So if I was doing Covey's time, it'd be like, yeah, I'm working on this project and when
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.300]   I'm done, I'm going to do this and I'm having a martini with lunch.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.300]   I think it was.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   No, totally.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   A different time.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   For sure.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   Okay.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   So let's get into then.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.680]   So in 4,000 weeks, you kind of go through the psychology, the futility, also the liberation
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.840]   of recognizing you can't do it all.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.340]   Life is finite and it's okay.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:24.780]   You can, instead of trying to control everything, trying to master your life with systems, you
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.000]   can make sure you make time for the important things.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.560]   Make sure you make time for just the present right now.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:35.020]   Your new book now wanders a little bit more into, okay, how do we put some of this in
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.660]   the practice?
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:38.660]   Which I appreciate.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:43.780]   So this is my big question, kind of my goal for this interview.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:51.980]   How do we find the line between having enough structure that it's not chaos, but not getting
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.620]   snapped in the productivity or efficiency trap?
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.180]   How do we find that line?
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.260]   Yeah, that's the question and it's probably the question that will surface the most interesting
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.820]   kind of differences between us I would expect.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:11.140]   So, you know, make for a better debate as it were.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.140]   So I want to say something quickly.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   I don't want to go on and on about the book, but about the structure of the book because
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.140]   I think it's like substantively relevant.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.140]   It's important.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.140]   The 28-day structure.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:26.740]   So this book is divided into four weeks and each week has seven short chapters.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:32.060]   And the invitation, as I put it, right, certainly not an instruction, is that you might read
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:36.660]   one of these chapters roughly per day for a month.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:43.140]   And part of the thinking there was that I really needed to avoid this book itself becoming
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.020]   another example of the kind of thing that you read and maybe take notes on for your
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.660]   note-taking system and then decide to put into practice one day when you've got lots
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.580]   of free time and you can do it perfectly, right?
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.860]   I really wanted to resist that and pull the rug from that every opportunity.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:00.980]   No, I'll just go into our Zettelkasten system, which will surface automatically the semantic
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.140]   connections and then we'll be brilliant.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.140]   Awesome.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.820]   I'm not sure I've ever found someone for whom it does work.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.820]   No.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.220]   So the idea of this is that if you're reading it roughly on this pace, or maybe you read
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:18.720]   it through once and go back and do it if you like something, that these tiny little perspective
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.340]   shifts, which are all in the direction of this approach that I call imperfectionism
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.660]   and all about sort of getting around to doing the stuff here and now, these little perspective
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:33.500]   shifts will actually take root and have some impact in the next 24 hours after you read
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   that chapter.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:40.740]   And so it doesn't become another of these things that you have to sort of make a big
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.220]   transformation in order to put it into place or wait until you've got the bandwidth.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.860]   It can just be something that helps right here and now in the midst of the too many
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   emails and the anxiety-inducing news headlines that you can't stop thinking about or whatever.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:03.300]   So in that sense, to come back to your sort of guiding question here, it's really about
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.620]   getting over the...
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:12.860]   It's really for people, at least on one level, who are very drawn to lots of structure and
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:19.780]   lots of plans and lots of systems, like me, because it's sort of constantly saying, "Well,
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.220]   yeah, that has a role to play, but the main thing is, can you just do one of the things
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.220]   now?"
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.380]   And it's like, "Well, this is an interesting rule you might like to follow, but in the
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.020]   meantime, just do that thing."
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:34.820]   It's about taking the things that we know we want our lives to consist of and building
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:40.900]   the muscle that allows you to just do a little bit of that thing today for 10 minutes, however
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.340]   imperfectly, with however little confidence that you're going to be able to make a practice
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.140]   of it and come back to it every single day for the rest of your life.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.140]   Because actually, I think that skill and the willingness - and it's kind of an emotional
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:58.260]   struggle anyway for a lot of us, I think - that skill to be able to do that, almost notwithstanding
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.900]   the systems, is kind of foundational.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:07.060]   And when you have that in place, I think, that's when all sorts of rules and structures
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.900]   can play a role.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:17.180]   I think my big fallacy in my earlier life was thinking that, first of all, I needed
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.860]   to figure out the structure.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.680]   I would then put the structure in place, and the emotions and the motivation and the inspiration
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.460]   would all sort of follow.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.020]   And I think it's probably the other way around.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.340]   >> I mean, I think that's really interesting because most people, including myself, don't
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:38.980]   always think about that aspect of delivering ideas, like the actual functional intake,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.940]   like how you encounter and start making progress on ideas.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.540]   We just give out the frameworks, which leads to - I think a lot of people do - which is
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.540]   framework collecting.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.860]   Let me just collect some more.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:54.740]   I'm getting closer to being ready to put things in, but let me collect a little bit more information.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.060]   Let me figure out exactly how this system is working.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.740]   Let me get my computer set up just perfect before I turn it on.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.140]   And so I really appreciate that about the book.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:10.220]   The book itself has a framework of like, hey, I know you don't want to hear a page a day,
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.220]   like a week.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.620]   Like, trust me, you need to actually start doing some things.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.420]   Religion kind of has this figured out, right?
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.260]   Where it's, okay, wait, you actually have to start doing the rituals for you to have
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.580]   a deeper religious experience.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.780]   You can't just sit and study the religion from afar and be like, okay, I'm convinced.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.780]   Let's do it.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.140]   Like, religion has been very good about that.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.220]   And so maybe it's borrowing a pretty good idea of like, you got to kind of get in there
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.220]   and we need help.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.980]   How do you kind of mess with imperfection?
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:45.860]   Get in there and get started, trying some things, making ideas that are abstract embodied
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.540]   so that like it's intuitive and you understand what's going on.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.540]   That's very smart.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.980]   I really like that about the book.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.980]   Thank you.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.620]   And I think when it comes to the structure piece, I've got this chapter in there on the
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:03.060]   idea that, really summing this up in some sense, that the role of rules and the role
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:09.500]   of systems in a productive and meaningful life has to be that those rules serve the
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:14.740]   life we want to live, rather than that our lives become in service to the rule.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:20.380]   So one example of where this comes, and I think could be maybe an interesting, I'm interested
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:27.940]   to know if you agree or disagree, is that an awful lot of approaches to productivity
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:35.180]   seem to me to be based around holding in check or even suppressing moods and desires, right?
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.740]   And to sort of say that the question of what you feel like doing in any given moment has
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.860]   really got to be put away in a box.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:51.060]   And I feel like I've tried that many, many times, without realizing I was doing it, and
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.740]   found that all that does is run into this sort of constant internal combat between what
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:02.040]   I feel like doing and what my system or my plan calls for me to do.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.260]   And so one of the things I'm looking at in this book is how can we maybe think about
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.100]   riding or harnessing those flows?
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.980]   What is the role for asking yourself, if you have the autonomy of course in your situation,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.660]   what is the role for asking yourself, "Wow, what do I feel like doing now?"
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:24.260]   And I quote Susan Piver, the meditation teacher who has written very eloquently about this
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:30.540]   idea that actually once she was able to sort of navigate a little bit more by pleasure
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.980]   or by what she wanted to do, you don't find that actually all you want to do is sit around
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.260]   and eat ice cream and not pay your bills and do your taxes.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.740]   You find that at the appropriate moment you're happy to do those things.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:47.700]   So obviously there is at least a sort of surface level tension here with most obviously time
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.740]   blocking even your very sort of flexible and accommodating approach to it.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.460]   I'm really interested to know what you make of those thoughts.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.740]   Well, I think it's a place where we disagree and agree.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.420]   So I actually agree with you.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.420]   It is draining.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.980]   The fundamental psychological state of time blocking is keeping your attention on the
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.700]   thing that is blocked even if you don't want to do it.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.300]   And it's draining.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.220]   It's why I talk about you can't, don't time block your evenings, don't time block your
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.220]   weekends.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:28.060]   Not that that wouldn't be useful, but you're just going to exhaust yourself.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.980]   It's really hard.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.220]   You have to take breaks more.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.340]   You have to kind of take days off.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:37.380]   I think time blocking is very psychologically difficult.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.100]   I also think I'd be glad actually if we didn't have to do it.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:47.380]   So I think we actually secretly agree is I see time blocking as a necessary evil for
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:52.460]   a lot of knowledge, work jobs, the, the amount of things that are being put on people's plates
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.340]   and knowledge, work jobs.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:59.300]   The only way for people to actually get them done in a way that they don't have to work
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.060]   late at night or in the morning or be running around with their hair on fire is they have
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.580]   to do this like really hard discipline they have to become.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:12.220]   It's like the monk, the Zen monk that masters Shaolin Kung Fu to sort of accomplish another
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.220]   mind state.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.060]   It's really hard work, but they're, you know, that's what they, that's what they have to
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.060]   do.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.060]   That's like, that's the trial.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.460]   So I think I said this on my show a few weeks ago.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.340]   I think you said something in, in, in response to something I'd said.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.340]   It was in response.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.340]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340]   It was great.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.820]   It was in response to, yeah, an interview you were doing where you're talking about it.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:33.380]   And I was saying, okay, where I agree is, um, I, I want to me an ideal job.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.140]   You wouldn't need a time block and time blocking is pretty brutal.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.740]   It also, however, gets about two, two X more things done during a normal workday.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.860]   And for like the really overloaded knowledge worker who doesn't want to bring their work
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.380]   home, who only has like a childcare window that lasts from here to there.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.760]   It's like, it brings home the bacon.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:59.640]   That's really interesting because actually, you know, there's a little chapter in my new
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   book about, you know, um, what I call the three to four hour rule about getting creative
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   work done.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   I love this rule by the way.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   We can, we can talk some more about it.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.040]   But like, and actually in a sense that is a, uh, advocating for some kind of time blocking,
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.040]   right?
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:19.120]   For sort of vigorously defending three or four hours in your day for this sort of deep work.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:26.200]   But then what I'm also saying is that, is that, um, not trying too hard to, to structure
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:30.680]   or block the rest of the, of the time being open to interruption and distraction that
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.120]   time and serendipity in that time, like that is where I place the sort of reasonable balance
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.600]   in terms of how much control we can expect to have over the flow of a workday.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:47.720]   So this leads me to the interesting, although possibly in some ways very kind of mundane
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.720]   conclusion that maybe the difference we're talking about here is just that I think I
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:59.920]   have the kind of stamina and capacity for time blocking about half of a ordinary working
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:06.780]   day and you're advocating doing it and including those sort of more, um, bitty email-y conversational
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.480]   parts of, of the day.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:15.960]   Um, in which case like, you know, uh, uh, unity and consensus has been, uh, has been
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   established.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.520]   And I'll say, and I think this is important data point in the summers, right?
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.280]   So when I'm, when I'm during the normal academic year, my job approximates, I think like a
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.680]   busy executive, right?
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.000]   Because I have the academic responsibilities.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.680]   I often have service responsibilities at Georgetown, like right now I'm the director of undergraduate
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.360]   studies for the computer science department and the director of a computer science ethics
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   major.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.960]   And I know academics always love getting lots of admin responsibilities.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.360]   It's our, it's our dream.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.280]   It's why we got into academia was to run things and, and go on committees.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.800]   Um, and then I have my writing, my podcasting, so I feel like I'm a, I'm a, like a mid-level
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   VP.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.080]   Uh, and I, I have to like time block the hell out of my days.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.800]   In the summer, I'm a full-time writer.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   I don't time block.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.360]   I think that's probably telling.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.400]   In other words, um, when my load becomes possible that I feel like I don't have to time block,
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.360]   I am like, good, right.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.080]   Let me, let me stop, let me stop actually doing it.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.000]   My fear is in the type of positions like I have during the school year.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.840]   If I went into the second half of the day, and so this is going to be a little bit more
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.840]   reactive and chaotic.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.520]   There's a lot of little things to do.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.600]   The reality of the modern workplace is you would lose the entire afternoon, right?
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.320]   It would all be emails and meetings like nothing would, I mean, it's basically writing off
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.160]   that time is the way I see it.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.160]   Interesting.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:45.320]   Um, it's really interesting because I sort of, the other author who I, and I mentioned
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:51.360]   him a couple of times in my book, and I'd, I'd, I'd be fascinated to hear an interview
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   between, if you ever decided to interview him, uh, this, um, this Dutch writer called
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.840]   Paul Lumens who's written this book called Time Surfing that I think you must maybe has
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   passed across your radar.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   I don't know.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.600]   It's a completely intuition based approach to time.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.640]   It's like, I'm slightly exaggerating, but it's basically throw away all lists, throw
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   away all plans and just, just navigate by your intuition and choosing what to do.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.880]   And it's certainly the most sort of well-developed and credible version of that very radical
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.200]   approach that I've, uh, ever encountered.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.300]   And it's, and so it's on the other end of the continuum here.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.160]   And so I guess where I'm, why I'm bringing him up right now is that I sort of, when I
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.360]   think about that second half of the, of the day or whatever it is, I think there's, there's
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:49.020]   something very useful about developing the muscle, metaphorically speaking, that permits
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.600]   you to, to not just be lost to that flow.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.800]   Now maybe there are workplace contexts where, you know, it's just people yelling at you
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:04.080]   and you can't possibly develop that muscle, but to sort of be able to think, well, actually
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.720]   what I would like to do now is this thing, even while I can feel the pressures of this
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   other thing.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:17.720]   I think in that there's something very useful being, being, um, being, uh, strengthened
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:23.880]   there and it's actually, I guess I'm a bit more optimistic than you that it can be relied
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   upon.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   But I'm curious though, right?
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.280]   Because I think this is the number one fear people have.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.840]   You know, I'm thinking about like my audience.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.040]   If I say, if they hear your advice, um, kind of feel where your energy is.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   They don't trust themselves.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.840]   They said, my energy is always going to say, look at social media or whatever, but what
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.020]   you're saying is no, no, no, that's trainable.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   And you have.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.200]   And so like, tell us about that.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:51.360]   Like give us confidence that with some practice you can actually make good decisions.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.000]   I think this thing about trusting yourself is extraordinarily powerful.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   I'm so glad you brought it up.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.600]   And it kind of comes up in all sorts of contexts.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:04.600]   So yeah, one of them is in planning the notion that the reason we have to sort of plan so,
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:11.800]   so vigorously is because, um, we will just completely lose ourselves to dopamine hits
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   or whatever.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:18.520]   If we aren't following a plan, it comes up in some sort of anxiety and worry about the
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   future.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.760]   And I quote Marcus Aurelius in this book, right?
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.960]   There's a famous line in his meditations where he says, don't worry about the future because
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:32.160]   you'll meet it with the same psychological resources, basically weapons in one translation
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.280]   that you meet the present with in the moment.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   We trust ourselves a lot.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:40.280]   We trust ourselves to implement all sorts of great productivity systems and make all
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.520]   sorts of plans.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.880]   But it's all premised on the idea that the future version of ourselves will be this kind
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:50.000]   of totally vulnerable person who's in sway to everyone else's agendas.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.800]   And Marcus is saying like, well, actually, like if, if you've got some agency over your
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:58.360]   life now, why not assume you're going to have agency over your life, uh, in the, in the
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.520]   future as well.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   So when it comes to, um, planning, yeah, we have this kind of strong sense that we know
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.320]   what we're doing now, but only on the basis that we won't know what we're doing, that
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.080]   we won't be able to trust ourselves later on.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.560]   And the ridiculous part about that, I don't know if I've ever quite managed to convey
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.880]   what I mean here, but is that even if you think of yourself as a person who's very plan
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.780]   driven, you are in fact completely spontaneous, right?
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:28.800]   Because you're deciding in each new moment to carry on following your plan.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.160]   So every bit of evidence you've got that's brought you to where you are now is that you
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.720]   can trust yourself to navigate through life like that.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.040]   And you know, absolutely the attention economy, social media, the world we live in is more
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.240]   of a threat and a challenge to that than anything before.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:47.840]   But no, I think it is completely trainable.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.600]   And that question I mentioned before about like, what do you feel like doing is a part
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   of that, right?
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:57.160]   Because it's to do with trusting that your, that the emotions and the whole world of your
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.640]   mind and psyche that are separate from your sort of rational thought right now might have
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.720]   some role to play, right?
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.920]   There might be something that can a little bit guide you instead of something you've
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.480]   got to constantly be trying to sort of eradicate and stamp out.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:16.920]   So yeah, I think it gets a little bit woo, maybe, but I think the sort of self-trust
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.240]   part of this is huge.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.800]   I believe that, right?
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   Like I buy that.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.520]   I think, tell me if you think this is fair.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.480]   I think part of the benefit we provide, the sort of collective audience, you and I, like
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:34.280]   the collective audience who does care about like, look, I feel overwhelmed, I care about
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.440]   my life, I want it to be meaningful, I don't want to just be stressed out.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.960]   All the issues that we deal with is we can present sort of two ends of a spectrum in
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.560]   which people find their way in the middle.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:53.920]   So like in my situation, you know, I have these multiple roles, I'm an extreme.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.160]   And so I have systems dialed in that makes it all manageable.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.920]   Like my planning is complicated because it's really pretty intricate.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.760]   Like I'm trying to make the writing career dovetail with the academic career, with this
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.720]   new media piece coming up over here and my, like, how does this all, it's complicated
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.080]   long-term plans.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.000]   And so like in my world, I do planning at different timescales for simplicity.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.080]   I say, look, I can't, in the moment, I'm not going to be able to keep straight the sort
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.480]   of complexity of how I'm trying to make these things work.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.360]   So why don't I like put aside time when I think about the big picture and then at the
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.800]   weekly scale, I can sort of distill that down to like, what matters about that for this
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   week?
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   Because a lot of this stuff doesn't.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.920]   And then on the daily scale, I don't have to worry about that at all.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.160]   But I also agree with you.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.460]   I think most people, their plan's not so complicated.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.200]   And the intuition, like they know, like this is what I'm trying to do and this is what's
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   important to me.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.560]   And maybe it's okay.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.480]   It's like you represent for people, first of all, there's like a psychological validation
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.320]   and reality of like what we struggle with and how we think about it, trusting intuition
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   more.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:05.840]   And maybe a lot of people find this is why both of us are popular is not that most people
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.400]   maybe aren't, they're not taking on all my systems.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.280]   I'm kind of an extreme, but maybe they have more than you're talking about, but they need
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:18.880]   to encounter both of us to try to figure out what they're doing.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.160]   This is like an Aristotelian approach to productivity.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.600]   The golden mean is where virtue lies.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.160]   I think there's a lot to that.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:38.560]   Certainly, you know, my working life is less complex than yours in the sense of these kind
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:45.040]   of whole big, significantly separate domains.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:52.640]   On the other hand, I kind of feel like I almost want to say that my working life and maybe
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.080]   everybody's working life by definition in a sense is sort of maximally complex, right?
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:05.200]   It's like there are, I still feel very much like I'm navigating through, you know, 2000
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.160]   things that I could in principle do with the next moment.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:14.920]   Definitely not sort of divided up in the way that I know your work is, but certainly like
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.000]   just a huge kind of pointless nightmare of things that I could spend the next.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.280]   And it's the reality of writing is that the better you do at writing, the more people
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.560]   want to try to stop you from writing by giving you all these things, all these opportunities.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.560]   That is absolutely true.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   I'm sure that something similar is there for sort of any, almost any knowledge work, right?
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.600]   The sense that like there's just an endlessly proliferating number of things that you could
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   be keeping track of.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:45.900]   So actually, I think a lot of what you say is right, but I also think that something
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.960]   about a somewhat more intuitive approach, a somewhat more self-trusting approach actually
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:57.800]   fits very well with a situation of great complexity because, you know, it's almost as if you can't
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:03.080]   work this out using, there isn't some algorithm you can bring to any sort of to-do list that's
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.440]   bigger than your time, than the bandwidth you have.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:14.080]   It's just going to be a question of broadly speaking, feeling your way and developing
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:19.560]   the self-trust to focus entirely on the thing that you do decide to do.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:23.560]   Because at least like, you know, do that thing and finish it instead of being distracted
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.880]   by the knowledge that there are an infinite number of other things you could be doing.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.680]   So is this a good summary, I want to hit some of like the big practical ideas from the book
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.880]   that resonated with me.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.040]   So here's three I want to underscore.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:41.000]   One, protect a few hours for deep work essentially.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.600]   Like you do, make sure you have some time protected every day for working on what's
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   important.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.840]   So a kind of acknowledgement of like, okay, if you're not protecting time at all, you're
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.920]   never going to just sort of have a lot of free time.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.440]   So just protect, use like two to four hours for working on something that's important.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.400]   Try to make progress on the things that matter.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.560]   Use the term daily-ish, which I like.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.200]   So that means like be regular, but don't beat yourself up.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.400]   It's got to be every day.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:11.440]   I liked the way you talked about Seinfeld and the Seinfeld don't break the chain, which
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.720]   is very popular online.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:18.280]   And he said, I just said that as a quip, like this should just try to do things often.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.480]   Like he wasn't supposed to be a big productivity system.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.200]   Again, self-trust because it's like, have the willingness to see that you can bring
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:32.760]   discipline to your work without, in some way other than sort of being absolutely enslaved
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:36.280]   to a very, very specific brittle system that you've got to follow every day.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Right.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.320]   You take your comedy seriously, you're going to work on it if you are sick on Sunday, it
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   doesn't really matter.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.320]   And then the third idea I was going to put into this trio, you talked about be okay with
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:53.000]   your house being messy when guests come over, which I actually see as probably meant as
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.120]   a broader metaphor for the imperfectionism philosophy you talk about, which is be okay
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.680]   with not everything has to be perfectly done.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.360]   Like, yeah, I didn't get around to cleaning up the house before people came over, but
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.560]   it applies to work as well.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   Like, you know what?
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.360]   I didn't like polish this thing or I was going to go do it's okay.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.560]   Like not, it's okay.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.400]   The goal is not everything has to be perfect.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   Right.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.120]   And I think something that's important to say about that, that's the chapter on so-called
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.400]   scruffy hospitality, right?
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:29.640]   Which is this great phrase that comes from an Anglican pastor from Tennessee called Jack
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   King.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.200]   And he's not just saying, and I'm not just saying like, it's okay, permission to not
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.400]   be able to do everything perfectly.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.800]   That's important because actually our fundamental nature as limited humans in this world is
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.480]   such that we're not going to be able to do things perfectly.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:52.200]   But it's also in that context, this really interesting relational side of it that this
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:58.760]   approach to literal hospitality, to having people around for dinner is very often more
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   connective, right?
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.840]   That actually when you sort of drop the facade of trying to do things perfectly, people feel
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.000]   more welcomed into your home and they feel like they must be your real friends because
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.880]   you're showing them the unvarnished version of you.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:19.160]   And I think where that sort of generalizes, I'm not suggesting that, you know, at a sort
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.880]   of white shoe New York City law firm, you can just walk around the office in your pajamas
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.880]   all day.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.460]   It's not, there are obviously limits to this.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.280]   But there is this thing, and I find this in my writing all the time, that when you're
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.920]   willing to sort of confess a little bit more to the kind of flaws and imperfections and
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.120]   insecurities that we all sort of navigate through the world with, people respond extraordinarily
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.120]   positively to that.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120]   There is a sort of-
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120]   Because they have the same.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.120]   Right.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.480]   And there is a kind of a, there's not just a sense of shared problems, but also a kind
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.760]   of an empowerment that comes from, like when I write an email newsletter that even mentions
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.800]   like this is what I do when I'm feeling completely overwhelmed by to-dos, I will get some responses
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.440]   that are like, I can't believe even you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed by to-dos.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.640]   And I'm like, what part of calling everything the imperfectionist did you not understand?
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.560]   But you know, there's something directly empowering and connecting and part of building a meaningful
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.640]   life for us all to just be a little bit more open with each other about the fact that we're
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.180]   not sort of sailing through it in absolutely perfect confidence.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:29.320]   So what do you think about the anxiety of workload, ideas like David Allen's full capture,
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.880]   having a place to store things so it's not in your head?
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.680]   Because I could see you falling on either side of this, it's systemsy, but also the
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.680]   idea of full capture comes out of, I don't want to be stressed about stuff all the time.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.720]   It can be sort of freeing.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.560]   So where do these ideas of not keeping stuff in your head, how does that fall into how
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.040]   you think about productivity?
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.560]   This is an interesting one because this is definitely one area where I'm sort of less
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:03:00.360]   intuitive in the sort of Paul Luman's sense that I mentioned and more systemsy.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.760]   And I don't know what you think about this, you may well have spoken about it.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.760]   But I think there's a really important and interesting distinction to be made between
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.520]   task management and time management.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:18.040]   And I think there's quite a strong argument that sort of very intuitive and flexible and
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.040]   forgiving approach to managing your time is actually aided by having a really quite rigorous
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.600]   and clear system of where you're recording things.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.760]   And I think that full capture part of David Allen, to this day, it's my immediate response
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.160]   to feeling like I'm overwhelmed and need to get clarity is to literally get like an enormous
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.080]   stack of index cards and write down on one per card every single thing until I've got
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.800]   a big pile and then think, okay.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.240]   The difference now is that I don't mistakenly think, now if I just do one after the other,
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   I will get to zero.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.400]   It's like, there it is.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:01.280]   And that enables me not to be taking on this, yeah, this role that the brain is not so great
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280]   at.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.760]   So, you know, I don't tend to sort of hugely structure those lists.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.440]   I've written elsewhere, I think, you know, having a sort of endlessly huge master list
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.680]   and then feeding things from that onto a very limited thing.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.360]   That's just the sort of Kanban has aspects of that idea in it, right?
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.260]   Keeping your work in progress, anything that does that, incredibly powerful.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.920]   But it starts with being willing to be, yeah, completely comprehensive.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.280]   Because otherwise, I think what you end up doing is not writing things down and not recording
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.840]   things because were you to do so, you'd be, you'd frighten yourself by how many things
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   there are.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.160]   And actually part of owning your limitations is to say, yeah, I exist in a world that has
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.600]   a 400 item list of things that are in some sense on my plate.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   Okay.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.840]   And I'm going to be doing about four today.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.080]   I mean, we used the phrase on the podcast, facing the productivity dragon.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.080]   Right.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.080]   Exactly.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080]   Which is looking at that list.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.400]   I've heard you use that and you're exactly, that's exactly the phrase.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   Okay.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.520]   So a place where it seems like we definitely agree, and this might differentiate us from
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.320]   some of the other writers on the topic, is it sounds like we both agree a life with no
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.000]   thought about productivity, that's not better either.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.440]   If it's just productivity as a construct of false consciousness or whatever, and I'm not
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.160]   going to have to do list.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.440]   I'm not going to think about what I am and am not going to do with structuring my time
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.200]   or having no thinking about organization.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.600]   It seems like, and you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.520]   We both sort of agree, well, that's going to be a stressful existence as well.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.880]   It's the, it's the horseshoe theory.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.760]   No productivity can bring you right back around to too much productivity.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.200]   It gets you to a stressful existence just via different means.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.440]   And the sort of, the part of you, the frontal cortex part that is planning and taking an
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.720]   overview, that's a part of you too, right?
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.920]   There's a very, there's a, there's a place you can go not so much in the sort of radical
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.560]   work critique stuff, but more in the spiritual literature that I've spent an awful lot of
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.680]   time in as well.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:10.800]   There's a place you can go that sort of takes you to the idea that there's something wrong
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:17.960]   about like thinking and strategizing and tactics and it's sort of, it's to be switched off
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.100]   if at all possible.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:24.720]   And then you get, you know, into the places where people use that phrase, like don't forget
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.440]   we're human beings, not human doings.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.200]   And I get very annoyed and want to sort of grab them by the lapels and say, no, doing
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.600]   stuff is the point here on some level, right?
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.840]   Doing the right stuff, absolutely.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.920]   Not just doing the biggest quantity of items totally, but there is some sense in which
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   the point of being alive, just to zoom out to the biggest picture possible, is to bring
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.160]   things into reality, to create stuff.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   People like doing things.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   Right.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.640]   And then maybe that's not what we traditionally think of as productive tasks.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:01.240]   Maybe it's to do with building a family or strengthening the bonds of a community or
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.280]   all sorts of things it could be, but it's still creative in the broadest sense.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.120]   And I don't think that that requires or even benefits from trying to sort of switch off
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.200]   the part of your brain that can make plans and strategies and organizational systems
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.200]   for that.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.320]   So we can summarize the goal here as you want to do things that are important without being
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.440]   chronically stressed out by the things you have to do.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440]   I love that.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.440]   Okay.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.440]   All right.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   So I think we've made some progress here.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:34.560]   I mean, it sounds like, okay, we agree a life with no thinking about tasks and organization
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.560]   time management.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.760]   You're going to, and that's very stressful and that'll alienate you from your nature.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.880]   We agree task management's important because if you have stuff just in your head, it's
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   stressful and you can't relax.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   You can't do anything.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.000]   You've got to have things written down somewhere.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Where we differ is actually pretty minor, I think, which is the degree of systemization
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.840]   needed to deal with the question of managing your time.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840]   Right.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:03.000]   Once you have that down, your advice falls short of systems.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.800]   I tend to talk about things in terms of systems.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.920]   That's pretty similar water, I would say.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.080]   And then we kind of have the same goal of, I think we both have a real aversion to anxiety
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   and stress.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.520]   I have a huge aversion to, I have too much to do.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   I'm overwhelmed.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520]   My day is packed.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.800]   I really dislike that.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.720]   I think we have that aversion.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.920]   So we're sort of on the same page and where we're differing is just to the degree of
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.800]   structuring and time management.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.240]   I think there's a lot to that point and, you know, it's always a little bit dissatisfying
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:45.440]   to bring kind of sort of personality type based arguments into things.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.140]   I don't like those things generally and I think I've heard you, I suspect that you also
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.320]   don't like that kind of form of argument.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:09:02.280]   But I do think that it's relevant and important to what I'm doing that when I say I'm not
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.960]   so into systems, I'm doing that from the point of view of someone who has sort of gone so
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.680]   far in the direction of systems, but I'm sort of providing an antidote to myself and to
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   people who think like me in this way and are this particular kind of, you know, recovering
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.040]   productivity geek or whatever the phrase I've used sometimes is.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:30.540]   So it's definitely sort of a, it definitely has that sort of antidote feeling to it.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:36.880]   It's like, this is the way to think if your tendency through your upbringing or whatever
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.200]   else is to swing so far in the other direction.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:47.520]   So I'm, you know, I'm super curious as to, in your aversion to being overwhelmed, for
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.200]   example, is that because you've been through large phases of being very miserable through
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.040]   being overwhelmed or are you actually coming from a significantly different personality
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:05.400]   than me who is in no danger of kind of massively overinvesting in attempts to control your
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   life?
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.800]   It's actually, it's more psychological with me.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:15.880]   In graduate school, I developed an insomnia that could be severe but random.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.940]   And it gave me this anxiety of if I try to do too much, so if my days are filled with
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:26.640]   like these things have to get done, what would happen if I don't sleep?
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.680]   I wouldn't be able to actually do that work from that like a quirk of braid wiring got
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.300]   me the way I started thinking about work is, okay, I need work to be something where tomorrow
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.320]   doesn't matter, but next month does.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:45.360]   In other words, like no particular day is critical, but it's critical that over the
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.280]   next month I make progress on the book.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.720]   So it's like, Sunday's not important, but February is, that's the way I began to think
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   about work.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   And it was just happenstance.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   I think if I hadn't had the insomnia, I probably would have fell into the, let's rock and roll.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.840]   Let me fill, let me fill every minute of the day.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.320]   Let me crush it because I, you know, I'm a capable person.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   I have high energy.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   I'm a smart guy.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.120]   I probably would have pushed a lot more into it.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.160]   And I probably would have been, I don't know, a more successful professor or something like
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.000]   this or had businesses or something.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.700]   So it's, it's a quirk, like a lot of my approach to time management, which is anxiety and stress
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:28.600]   reducing based is I don't trust myself to be able to get after it every day.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.680]   So how do I design a whole life where that's not necessary?
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   Right.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.680]   That makes perfect sense.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.680]   I love that.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680]   Well, anyways, I could, I could talk, I could geek out about this forever, but I know you're
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   on a book tour.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680]   You have a schedule.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.440]   Oliver, my, my audience loves you.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.440]   They love your stuff.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.360]   I've, they're, they're always talking about it.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   We talk about a lot on the show, so I know they're excited.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:54.440]   They're excited for this one and I'm excited that you're here by the new book.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.960]   You will like if you, if you like what we talked about on the show, you are going to
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.340]   absolutely love meditation for mortals.
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:03.420]   And if you haven't read 4,000 weeks, you should read that too.
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.480]   You don't have to, but you should read, you should read both of those as well.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.360]   Oliver, a real pleasure.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.360]   Thanks for joining the podcast.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.360]   Thank you.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   I'm so glad we got to do it.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.360]   All right.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.580]   So that was my conversation with Oliver.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.940]   I hope you liked it.
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:22.700]   We have some more in-depth interviews lined up in the spirit of Oliver Berkman's philosophy.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.260]   I'll release them as I have time.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.580]   I'm not trying to put too much pressure on myself.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:31.180]   I'm just using my intuition as he would say, to figure out when there's an idea I like
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.260]   and to release them as I am able.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.520]   Again, you got to check out Oliver's book.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.540]   His new book is called meditations for mortals and is fantastic.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:43.580]   His previous book, 4,000 weeks is a must read if you haven't read that as well.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:47.140]   We'll be back on Monday with another normal episode of the show and we'll be back with
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.220]   in-depth probably in the next three or four weeks or so.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:53.140]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
