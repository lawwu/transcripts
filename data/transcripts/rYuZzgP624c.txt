[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.360]   Pastor John, you shared with me about a conversation
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.300]   you recently had with someone who was wondering
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.520]   if he could forgive his father,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.800]   when his father did not even admit to having done anything
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.680]   that needed to be forgiven.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.560]   And you said that as that conversation unfolded,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.120]   it proved really fruitful for you
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.580]   and for the person you were talking with.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.720]   Could you take us into that conversation
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.280]   and explain why it was so helpful
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.040]   and explain what we can all learn about forgiving others?
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.120]   - Right, the reason it became so helpful
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   is that I saw implications for my own life.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.160]   My relationship with my wife, my children, my colleagues,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.700]   I saw reverberations everywhere.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.480]   That very often happens to me
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.460]   when I'm trying to help someone else who asked me a question
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.700]   sort out their relational issues.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.580]   I'm forced to apply those very things to myself.
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.500]   And so the insights don't stay
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.700]   at any kind of theoretical level
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.420]   or even just relevant for others,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780]   but they become urgent for me.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.060]   So that was the case
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.420]   and that's why this is on the front burner for me.
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.080]   So the first thing I was drawn to say to him
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.740]   was yes, the fullest experience of forgiveness
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.940]   involves the other person recognizing the wrong
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.540]   that he's done against you
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.260]   and repenting and asking for forgiveness.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.740]   And then you give forgiveness freely by grace
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.980]   because of what Christ has done for you.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.180]   And so the offense that's been taken
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.460]   and the offense that was done are laid down,
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.720]   put aside and not brought up again.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.780]   That's full, robust forgiveness.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.500]   Jesus talked about it in Luke 17, three,
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.020]   where he said, "If your brother sins, rebuke him.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.340]   And if he repents, forgive him.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.940]   And if he sins against you seven times in the day
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.420]   and turns seven times and says, I repent,
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.900]   you must forgive him."
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.620]   But my friend who asked me this question
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   was asking not about that situation
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.640]   and how you get the grace to forgive somebody seven times
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.760]   who repents seven times,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.200]   but what do you do with, in this case,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   a father who doesn't recognize any wrong that's been done
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.260]   and so isn't repenting, isn't asking for forgiveness.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.120]   Does forgiveness make any sense in that situation?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.160]   How do you navigate that?
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   And what I said was that there are two other,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.020]   at least two other categories, biblical categories
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.780]   that need to be stirred in here besides forgiveness.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.280]   One is, I'll call it enemy love.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.020]   And when I say enemy love,
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.500]   I'm not just thinking about a declared enemy,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.740]   and I've got this awful enemy,
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.100]   but rather people like spouses or sons or daughters
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.820]   or dads in this case,
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.520]   who in the moment are acting like an adversary.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680]   I mean, they are hurting you the way an enemy would hurt you.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.100]   They're not your enemies in that sense, in the big sense,
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.840]   but rather they are in that moment
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.120]   acting with enmity toward you.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.600]   So the Bible doesn't just talk about forgiveness there,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.440]   it talks about enemy love.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.220]   Jesus said, "Love your enemies.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.320]   Pray for those who persecute you."
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.980]   And Peter picked it up in chapter three, verse nine,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.520]   first Peter, "Do not repay evil for evil
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.400]   or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.080]   for to this you were called,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.720]   that you may obtain a blessing."
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   So here we're told how to relate to a person
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.480]   who's not repenting, not recognizing any wrong being done,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.880]   or maybe they are and they're glad they're doing it.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.440]   And the answer is don't return evil for evil,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.420]   rather bless them.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.280]   So it's not an issue of the fullest kind of forgiveness.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.520]   You could call it maybe one-sided forgiveness.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.160]   The Christian is choosing not to be the punisher,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.360]   but treating the other person better than they deserve,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.260]   in a sense, as if they hadn't been hurt.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.560]   Now, the second category,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.120]   besides enemy love and forgiveness,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   is forbearance or endurance, Colossians 3:12.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   "Put on, as God's chosen ones,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240]   holy and beloved, compassionate hearts,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.500]   meekness, patience, bearing with one another,"
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.380]   or the old King James, "forbearing one another,"
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.620]   or enduring.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.620]   And Paul says in, what, 1 Corinthians 13, seven, I think,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.140]   "Love bears all things, believes all things,
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.140]   hopes all things, endures all things."
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.460]   So love doesn't just forgive when another person repents
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.240]   and doesn't just bless when we're hurt,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.260]   but it bears with, it endures, it forbears.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.780]   And both Peter and James call that
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.060]   a covering of a multitude of sins.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.460]   Love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.120]   It just covers them and endures them.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.180]   They don't go away.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.380]   You're just enduring them and you're covering them.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.620]   Now, at this point in our conversation
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.820]   with the man I'm talking about,
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.300]   it became clear that one of the main obstacles,
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.360]   I felt it, he felt it, to actually acting this way,
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.540]   forgiving, forbearing, returning good for evil,
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.540]   blessing those who hurt us, is that if we do this,
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.140]   if we really return good for evil,
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.560]   not the kind of manipulative way
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.320]   that hopes to really draw attention
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.020]   to the other person's guilt,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   but I'm talking about a really authentic blessing,
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.740]   treating with kindness and hope from the heart.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.660]   If we do that, very few people,
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.260]   if anybody, will know that we've been hurt.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.980]   And if we're returning good for evil,
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.040]   then we're not moping around,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.860]   our countenance is not cast down,
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.300]   our shoulders are not shrugged,
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.780]   we haven't withdrawn into a silent funk,
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.620]   we're not drawing attention to our woundedness,
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.620]   we're acting in a cheerful, hopeful, gracious way,
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.980]   and nobody will have any idea that we've been insulted
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.380]   or put down or wounded or cheated.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.060]   And here's the rub,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.060]   almost everything in my sinful soul cries out,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.940]   against that.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.940]   We want people to know that we've been hurt,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.540]   we want people to pity us, or at least sympathize with us,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.420]   or recognize that our effort to return good for evil
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.140]   is a noble effort in the face of much difficulty,
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.520]   good grief, if nobody knows, shoot, then what?
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.740]   And you can see what's going on.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.740]   And perhaps, most of all,
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.940]   we want the person who has wounded us
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.020]   to be aware that they have wounded us.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.200]   And we don't want to act in a way
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.860]   that looks as if they didn't hurt us,
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.860]   that looks as if it makes light of the fact
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.480]   that they wounded us or insulted us or put us down
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.580]   or criticized us in an inappropriate way
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.820]   or cheated on us or something.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.820]   And all of this is a huge obstacle to obeying the Lord
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.220]   when he says, "Do not return evil for evil,
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.060]   "but bless those who do you harm."
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.260]   And here's the key.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.300]   This is where I am right now in my dealing with this
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.260]   and my trying to process it from my own soul.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.300]   Here's the key that proved so convicting to me.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   The key is how important and how satisfying
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.140]   to us is the fact that God knows we've been hurt,
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.320]   that God understands and God attends to us.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.680]   God feels with us.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.300]   He is a merciful high priest.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.560]   Is that enough?
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.380]   What this showed me was how deeply my heart
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.860]   tends to be oriented on other people
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.980]   more than it's oriented on God.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.740]   Our great need, my great need,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.740]   is that God be more real to me than other people are.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.780]   When God sees us returning good for evil,
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.940]   he knows everything.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.140]   He knows we've been insulted or treated unjustly
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.700]   or cheated or whatever.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.940]   He knows it and he's sympathetic and he's attentive
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.460]   and he sees that we are returning good for evil
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.020]   when harm has been done to us.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.420]   He sees that we are obeying him.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.300]   He sees that we're loving our adversary.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.820]   And 1 Peter 2, 19 says,
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.020]   this is a gracious thing with God
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.980]   when we suffer unjustly and return good for evil.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.500]   God delights in it.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.860]   We're pleasing God at that moment.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.980]   And the key passage that I think we have to come to terms
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.300]   with is 1 Peter 2, 23.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   When Jesus was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.140]   When he suffered, he did not threaten,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.980]   but continued entrusting himself, his cause,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.740]   to him who judges justly.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.220]   And so my question for me and for my friend,
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.500]   for anybody who finds himself like us,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.980]   is it enough for God to know our sorrow,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.380]   for God to know our pain,
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.540]   for God to know our disappointment, our frustration?
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.220]   Can we hand our cause entirely over to God?
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.700]   Can we move forward treating others better
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.260]   than they treat us,
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.140]   even if it means only God knows and nobody else?
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.620]   That's how real God has to become to us.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.940]   - Boy, that is an incredible challenge, Pastor John,
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.500]   dying to our woundedness.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.460]   Thank you for prying into these dark motives
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.700]   at work in our hearts.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.220]   Well, we're gonna return tomorrow
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.620]   and we're gonna close out the week looking at the motto,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.220]   no creed but the Bible.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.300]   Is it wise to avoid creeds?
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.060]   And how should we think about confessional Christianity?
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.580]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.660]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:27.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
