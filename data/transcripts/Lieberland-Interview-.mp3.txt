[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.600]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we're going to talk about freedom, specifically freedom of country.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.200]   I'm here with the president of the nation of Liberland.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000]   Vite, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Great to be here, Yisho.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.760]   So here at Radical Personal Finance, for your background, we talk about freedom in all of its senses,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.120]   focusing on financial freedom, because of course, if you have enough financial freedom, you can buy for yourself a significant level of lifestyle freedom.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.640]   But from time to time, we do talk about freedom of countries, free places to live, etc.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.520]   And you also care a lot about this concept to the point where you started your own country focused on freedom.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.720]   Tell us the story.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.600]   It was six years ago now when we decided enough was enough.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.840]   And maybe actually also because many people told me I should start my own country.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:40.040]   I was very vocal about freedom, about free markets, and I was trying to push the idea of turning Czech Republic into New Switzerland.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.600]   And there are not too many fans of that idea.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.640]   You know, they really believe there is not enough Swiss people to basically turn Czech Republic into Switzerland.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.840]   But on the other hand, I realized there is enough people that share a similar belief, that want to have a new country at some point.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.320]   But I was thinking, you know, that we will get like 20,000 people applying for citizenship when we started Liberland,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.680]   or shortly before I was there, by the end of the year.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.760]   And the reality was completely different.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.120]   We had actually 20,000 first hour and 200,000 by the end of the week.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.720]   Now we've got 750,000 people that applied for citizenship.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.440]   It's a huge nation by now.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.600]   By no means Liberland is a micronation.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.160]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.520]   So for the background, you've always been interested in libertarian ideals, freedom-oriented ideals.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.000]   In your bio, it says that you read "The Law" when you were a young man by Friedrich Bastiat, and you were inspired by his concepts.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Definitely.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.920]   And here at Radical Personal Finance, there's actually an entire episode of the show that consists of my simply reading "The Law" for anybody who's interested.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.840]   Awesome, awesome. That's really cool.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.520]   So where did the actual, let's talk about the physical territory first.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.240]   Where is Liberland?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.680]   Liberland is located between Croatia and Serbia, only 10 kilometers away from the Hungarian border.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080]   It's a beautiful spot of land.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.960]   It's actually heart-shaped.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   It's three times bigger than Monaco.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.760]   Unlike many people say, it's too small to build.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.000]   No, you know, you could fit three Monacos inside of it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.360]   And it was created through this kind of crazy border dispute between Croatia and Serbia.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.280]   That means that none of the countries for the last, now 35 years, have claimed the territory.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.080]   So we just came there six years ago.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.000]   We stick the flag.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.280]   We said this piece of land is Liberland.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.800]   And we received enormous recognition by the world media.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.400]   And now, luckily, we also receive recognition by other sovereign states.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.160]   Right.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.520]   At the beginning, though, there was, from my reading about it, there seemed to be more people contesting your claims.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.280]   But some of those that has changed recently.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.880]   I don't think anybody really contested the claims by Liberland.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.520]   Croatia basically, Serbia stated right away, which was very important.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   And if you look into any world map, Serbia is part,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.200]   Liberland is basically part of Serbia on the regular world maps.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.480]   And what Serbia stated is that they don't mind creation of Liberland on this territory.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.400]   It was an official Serbian claim by the foreign ministry, only 10 days after Liberland was created.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.880]   And that actually raised a lot of eyebrows.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.400]   Croatia secretly meet on the Sunday following day.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.040]   And imagine that they actually put together a governmental meeting just to question how do we tackle Liberland.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.480]   And they said they will call it internet joke, but they never ever claimed that this piece of territory is theirs.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.320]   And of course, Liberland is the best solution, potential solution to their whole border dispute.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.320]   And I'm quite happy that Croatia is doing what they're doing for us right now.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.440]   They're actually protecting our borders.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.520]   So you have a piece of land that is a border dispute.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   On most maps, it seems to be within the lines of Serbia.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.800]   Why doesn't Serbia claim it?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.840]   Well, that's simple, because if they did, they would go with the Croatia's version of the border.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.480]   That means they would lose a lot of other territory in a different place, in different places.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.880]   OK. And so Croatia doesn't claim this land.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.840]   Why not? Because they want this other land in other places.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.400]   OK, so they have other border disputes.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.680]   And this particular piece of land is not claimed for more than 35 years by neither of these sovereign states.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.400]   Because of the impact on their other areas.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.080]   I see. OK, so you and some friends went to Liberland.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.560]   You planted a flag and said, we claim this land for Liberland.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.120]   Yes, exactly. That's what we did.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.280]   OK, but you didn't just... it wasn't just an Internet joke.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   Like you actually intend to build a legit country.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.320]   We went there to start a country.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.680]   That was the only thing which we didn't expect that there will be such a huge interest in actually doing so.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.960]   I was really thinking this will be a really multi-year project in which we will slowly grow our claim.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.240]   And I wouldn't believe that there would be Russia today, knocking on my door the next day after we established a country.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.280]   And right after Russia today, the CNN comes and wants to report about Liberland.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:16.040]   So there was like a substantial media coverage by basically the state's televisions of the world coming down and acknowledging our claim.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.520]   What is a country? What do you need to have a country, in your opinion?
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.840]   Well, there are these Montevideo criteria that you need to have a population.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   I'm fine with 700,000 people, basically, but right now signed up.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.240]   You need to have a territory.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.720]   I'm really happy about the whole territory of Liberland.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.840]   It's a really beautiful, heart-shaped piece of land with very well-defined borders with our neighbors.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.560]   You need to have a governance.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.280]   We have this, I would say, classical government, very stable.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.440]   I would say more stable than what our neighbors have currently.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.400]   And you need to have diplomatic relations with other countries.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.800]   And that's why I started these representative offices in more than 115 countries around the world.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.440]   There is a person responsible for our diplomatic relations with some other countries.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.600]   So also, we are, I would say, better covered.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.760]   We're covering the world better than traditional European countries in that sense.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.200]   But that, of course, is not enough.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.960]   You really have to have people that are in direct relations with the government that are able to open the right talks at the right time,
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   and that are able to get Liberland recognized sooner or later.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.320]   Is there anybody living in the territory of Liberland?
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.000]   Well, right now, we do have houseboats.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080]   Something changed three weeks ago.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.440]   We stopped having problems with Croatian police while we were coming from Serbia, which is pretty exciting.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.920]   But I don't want to have any to knock on the wood.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.640]   And I just hope it continues.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:53.680]   But for the case it doesn't, we are actually building a floating city on Danube next to Liberland, a couple of meters away from the shore.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.480]   We're putting together houseboats and people that want to do business and live in Liberland can do so.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.360]   But on the other hand, we also started developing a piece of Serbia right across the river.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.160]   We're building actually a really nice resort.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:12.760]   I think it's an important part of the story of Liberland that we kind of get ourselves settled on the other side of the river as well.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.320]   We're building something really nice and futuristic.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.360]   And I've got Zaha Hadid, one of the best architectural studios in the world.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.000]   They just finished Beijing airport, for example.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.800]   So they stepped up and they really wanted to help us from the beginning.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.640]   And now it's a time for them to do something which will be actually built in physical reality.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   And it will be a small, little Liberland across the river.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.160]   Did you fight Serbia for the land?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.680]   How did you get this land across the river?
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.200]   No, no, no. We actually bought it one week ago.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.560]   OK. So it's pretty fresh.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:47.080]   So you used the money from people buying citizenship.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:56.640]   Actually, no. For this particular case, I used the Ethereum, which I bought as a private person when the whole sale started.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.840]   So I used that, but I put it into a company and that company bought the property.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.800]   OK. And this company is a state asset of Liberland.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.240]   It is kind of a state asset.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.720]   Yeah. But it's still like it's a private venture.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:19.680]   Unlike, I would say, we really don't want actually state to interfere with the business of the regular business.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.920]   I don't think state should be a developing property.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.880]   So I'm kind of sitting on two chairs.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.000]   Some of these things are private businesses.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.600]   And I'm also president of Liberland as well.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   I'm trying to do the best so I kind of don't have friction between these two positions.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.800]   But I believe that the state shouldn't develop a land, like shouldn't build resorts.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.200]   We really have private investors to do so.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.360]   And the same thing should apply for Liberland.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.440]   State should really take care of security, justice, diplomacy, and that's it.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.080]   You know, don't give a state another power to do that.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.880]   We will be selling land in Liberland.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.480]   We will be selling the land in Liberland.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   But that's a, OK, the government will decide how the land will be distributed.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.120]   But it shouldn't build something there inside of it.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.280]   Like housing for Liberlanders or something like that.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.600]   Right. So what I find so interesting about this, I was having a conversation with someone earlier this afternoon.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.280]   We were talking about Bitcoin and the concept of cryptocurrency.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.440]   And I was talking about how I genuinely believe, one of the things I believe now that I didn't believe some time ago,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:41.640]   but I genuinely believe that the world can change the way that it views things faster than we imagine.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.200]   And we're talking about money.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.120]   One of the things that in the future I'm going to do, which I've heard a number of people do,
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:54.240]   and I realized how powerful it was, is instead of using money, some people have just mentioned in passing,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.760]   oh, when you want to turn your Bitcoin into fiat.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.240]   Well, of course, being interested in economics for a long time, I'm well familiar with the use of the word fiat.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.920]   But I don't use it in normal conversation.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.680]   It's not something I just say, OK, how much fiat would you like or how much US dollar fiat would you like?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.000]   In the future, I think I'm going to do it because I realize how powerful it is.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.960]   It's absolutely true.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.920]   It's simply a way of acknowledging the reality of what a currency like the US dollar is.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.280]   It's a fiat currency.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:34.200]   Now, I was thinking, though, that I increasingly do believe today that we actually could change.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.280]   I was not an early believer in things like Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.120]   But as I thought about that, I've realized that I was wrong because we really could change
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.360]   and people really could use these currencies.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.160]   And I think that that change could happen faster than ever.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.920]   So I was thinking about Liberland and the concept of the state, the concept of the government.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.640]   And you mentioned Monaco.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.920]   Monaco, you say that Liberland, the physical territory of Liberland that you've claimed
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.440]   is three times larger than the physical territory of Monaco.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.680]   But no one in the world would say that Monaco is illegitimate just because it's a third
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.960]   of the size of Liberland.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   Monaco is legitimate.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.640]   You can be a citizen of Monaco.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.120]   You can live in Monaco.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.280]   Famously, many wealthy, successful people do live in Monaco because famously it's a
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.720]   tax haven.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.080]   You can become Monagask.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.560]   No, it doesn't happen actually.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.000]   There are three, four generations of Italians living there and they still didn't get the
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   citizenship.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.640]   So the prince has to be the one.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.640]   It's actually not happening.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.920]   I don't think it's like really difficult.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   So the point is that the physical size of a nation doesn't necessarily determine its
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.320]   legitimacy, I guess is the point.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:01.800]   And so as I think about the Liberland concept that you're building, it really is possible
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.240]   to build a nation.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.000]   It's not like you have to...
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   Senores, hey, senores, senores, por favor, estamos grabando una entrevista acá.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   Ok?
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.160]   Por favor, gracias.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.200]   The physical size of a nation doesn't determine its legitimacy.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   So what does determine the legitimacy of a nation, I guess is my question.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.400]   I would say it is...
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.920]   I would say the best countries are actually formed by nations that have a clear vision
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.760]   of how they want to govern themselves.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.640]   And of course, the more free market vision they have, the better the country that they're
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.080]   forming is.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.960]   And again, like country or nation is nothing but a common belief how to run your business.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.600]   It's not connected to your language.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.960]   It's not connected to your culture, not connected to your color of the skin.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:10.600]   It's literally a way how you think about how things should be run in a society.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.060]   Does a country have to be a place where lots of people live?
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.440]   Because you have hundreds of thousands of citizens of Liberland, and yet nobody is physically
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.120]   located full time on that physical territory.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   I guess my wife is actually having a party in Liberland as we speak.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.680]   So they took 25 ladies out for a boat ride, and now they're partying inside of Liberland.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.140]   So there are people physically there.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.720]   But the fun part is that, yes, you're right.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.280]   But to be honest with you, for the recognition by other countries, it's actually important
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.720]   to have the territory.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.560]   And there is so much space on this planet.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.920]   Like come on, there could be thousands of countries here.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.000]   And of course, it's also just a convention that you need to have a physical space.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.460]   They tried to get rid of this rule that actually they kind of kicked out the possibility to
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:06.720]   put man-made platforms as a territory when these things like Rose Island, as you probably
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.420]   saw the movie, started to happen.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.760]   But it's also just a convention.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.400]   But why not fulfill the convention?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.240]   There are still so many places that kind of can be claimed as a country on this planet.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   I agree.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   I agree.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.400]   So that's a good question.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.720]   I was thinking about this just because I'm so intrigued by the idea and the philosophical
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.360]   implications and questioning all of my own assumptions and beliefs.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.120]   I guess one thing I think you need for the legitimacy of a nation is simply for other
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.360]   nations to accept it as legitimate.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.100]   There's nothing really more than that.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:47.800]   So if we think about, I don't know, I can't restate any better.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.720]   You need other nations to say, "Yes, we accept you as legitimate."
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.400]   And then basically, if that can happen, then that nation state can flourish more and more.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.240]   I don't think that's the case, actually.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.200]   And the International Law is also very specific about it.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.640]   The existence of state is independent of recognition by other states.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.760]   That's actually one of the articles in Montevideo Criterion.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.840]   Really?
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.460]   So you established, tell me the story of Somaliland.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.060]   Because you established, Liberland established diplomatic relations with Somaliland.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.500]   But I'm not familiar with that story, but I thought it would be interesting to hear.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.160]   Tell me about Somaliland and their struggles to attain recognition.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.620]   They are fully functional for 30 years, fully functional country with defined borders.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.500]   It's as big as United Kingdom.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.040]   There is five million people living there.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.500]   They have very decent government.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.540]   There are no security threats, unlike in Somalia.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.780]   But nobody recognizes them.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.340]   Or actually, it's starting to happen.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.280]   Because it was kind of pathetic that the world decided not to recognize Somaliland for some
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   strange reason.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.420]   Nobody really knows why.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.060]   But right now, it's slowly developing relations with other countries.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.660]   And I knew that it's going to happen.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.820]   I kind of wanted to help them.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:06.580]   I thought we will be kind of working hands in hand on recognition of Liberland and Somaliland.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.580]   So it's kind of happening.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.060]   I helped them to get to a couple of international conferences on high level.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:17.060]   And I'm helping them to get more good contacts in the Western world, where we are strong.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.980]   And I think we actually do have similar size coverage in terms of marketing, like Somaliland
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.340]   does have.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:29.420]   And funnily enough, we also have similar size budgets, for example, for the foreign efforts.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.820]   So from that perspective, I was just thinking, they are actually good partners.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.340]   Why don't we recognize them first?
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.260]   Because we are going to work hand in hand with them to get more recognitions.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.580]   And I also believe it's a huge business opportunity.
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.620]   All Somaliland is full of gold, iron, ore, diamonds.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.100]   Just nobody is picking them up from the street.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100]   Wow.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100]   OK.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.940]   So how can I be attracted to Liberland?
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.940]   What can Liberland offer me in order for me to want to immigrate to Liberland?
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.540]   I think it's a great opportunity to find like-minded people.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.020]   And the price of the citizenship is cheap now.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.220]   In a way, it's much lower than your golf course yearly fees.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.980]   But it's going to change because we are putting merit, which is the currency basically which
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.420]   you need to stake, we're putting it on a float.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.060]   It's going to be basically decided by market what the value of that will be.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.420]   So it might just skyrocket as well.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.580]   I think it will actually.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.540]   So it is a very, I would say, it's a very good social club.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.220]   That's for sure.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.500]   But then it's also a concentrated effort to build a sovereign country, which I think,
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.580]   you know, we don't have much competition right now.
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.420]   Everybody is doing what we're doing in a way.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:49.060]   So the idea is that I could join Liberland by becoming a citizen.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.940]   I would pay for that citizenship.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:19:00.300]   I can pay for it in fiat or in some other form of currency that Liberland accepts.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.620]   And I can become a citizen immediately?
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.620]   Yes.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.620]   Yes.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.620]   That's the way it is.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.620]   And about how much does that cost right now?
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.620]   It's now 5,000 merits.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.780]   And my merit is still tied to US dollar.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.660]   So you have a currency called the merit.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.540]   The merit is currently pegged to the US dollar.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:20.780]   So I could turn 5,000 US dollars fiat into 5,000 merits.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.380]   And then I could purchase my citizenship with that.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.420]   And in exchange for that, what would I receive?
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.820]   You're going to get passport.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:32.020]   You're going to get e-residency card, which you can use to open companies, for example,
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.680]   in Liberland.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.060]   You get access to, I don't know, Chamber of Commerce, our yearly events.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.260]   You know, you'll be able to actually vote.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.100]   And I think we are like three months away from the blockchain governance.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:51.020]   So we will be able to vote with your merits who will be sitting in the Liberland Congress.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.180]   You will be able to take part of public veto.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.740]   And you will be able to utilize the system of Liberland courts, for example.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:05.080]   And you're seeking, I understand, to put all of the Liberland government functions onto
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   the blockchain.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   Is that right?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   That's exactly our mission.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.120]   I think it's also pretty cool to do that when the technology is just ready for it.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   We took whatever Polkadot has put together so far, which I think is a nice code, and
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.360]   we are putting it, we are twisting it a little bit to build the whole country on top of the
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360]   technology.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.060]   So Polkadot is something like Ethereum, but it's a proof of stake network, which I think
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.580]   is the right concept for a country as well.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:40.340]   You mentioned that the three basic functions that you see for government, because I think
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:46.060]   most of us who are freedom-oriented, the vast majority of us, I think, would concede that
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.100]   there is a role for something called government.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.240]   We argue at the fringes about what that role is.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.780]   Should it be in developing national parks?
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.780]   Should it be in building roads?
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.700]   Should it be in maintaining militaries?
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.180]   You mentioned three things earlier.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:06.660]   Security of its citizens, a court system, and diplomacy with other nations.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.660]   If you don't have an army, at least you really need to have good relations with your neighbors.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:17.860]   So can those things be expressed in the virtual world?
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:23.060]   The system of decentralized course is something which has, I would say, erupted in the blockchain
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.060]   world already.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:29.220]   You've got companies like Kleros that are trying to build a decentralized court system
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.340]   or juror.io.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.620]   And I think it's a good time for us again to kind of learn from them and put it on a
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:41.780]   complex blockchain which represents a nation state.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.300]   And diplomacy is a bit difficult.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.420]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.340]   The system, of course, can be kind of put on blockchain and also scaled and decentralized,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.700]   which is pretty cool.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.660]   But with security, I think we can uberize Liberland police fairly easy.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.540]   And we had this application called 911, which was kind of a test of it.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.940]   And then there is another application like Liberland e-residency application.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.940]   We're still testing it.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.180]   But I think there is a bright future for a similar concept.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.700]   Actually uberizing the service of the police.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:16.260]   So you allow all the citizens that feel like protecting the others to log into the application
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.460]   and simply provide the service.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.460]   Interesting.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.060]   Yeah, I mean, there's a tremendous amount of ideological agreement that I have with
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.420]   some of these concepts.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.760]   My opinion, if I were painting my perfect world, I have one function for government,
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.560]   and that is the courts.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.540]   I believe that that's fundamentally at its core what the function of government is.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.780]   You need a magistrate and you need a court system where one person can bring a complaint
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:47.460]   against another person and an independent third party can pass judgment and have some
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.660]   kind of sanction brought against that person who is found to be in the wrong.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.300]   And so it's fascinating to think of building a nation from the ground up.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.980]   It's fascinating to think of what could happen.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.980]   Well, I'm also really excited about launching the whole things system.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.980]   We're doing very well.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.660]   I would say the last month was the most successful month of Liberland in terms of finance and
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:11.580]   new people coming and organization and all these things that are literally starting just
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.380]   now like the village, like free trade zone that we are building in Serbia, like new boats
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.700]   coming to Liberland, like the fact that we can actually access the land.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.580]   But I think there will be a huge boost, another round of huge boost once we actually put things
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:29.140]   on blockchain because there will be different people in the blockchain arena that will recognize
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.540]   the achievement.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.720]   And I hope, you know, in combination with the things that we already done, we managed
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.420]   to get the country recognized by a couple of other countries and the fact that we are
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.340]   actually putting together decent governance for the whole system.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.980]   They will just like to support it.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.760]   I don't think we will have a problem with people paying voluntary taxes in Liberland.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.540]   So I've got about three questions left.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.740]   Number one, you mentioned taxes.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.980]   The vision of Liberland is that the tax system would be voluntary.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.980]   Tell me about that.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.660]   Yeah, we really believe it's time to switch this relation from like if you don't pay taxes,
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.460]   we put you into jail into like, can you please contribute to this particular effort of the
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:11.380]   government and you will actually get the shares of that project or of the government itself
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.180]   back, which I think is a reasonable way how to run things.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:25.540]   So, that's my belief, you know, and I think once you actually do this, you know, we will
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.380]   attract so much attention when we get this off the ground and it will be working.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:36.420]   That again, I'm really truly a believer that you don't really need a tax system, a non-voluntary
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.680]   tax system in the new millennia, that we need to get more civilized as a society and stop
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:47.340]   these kind of clans taking over different states and basically extorting the value from
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.060]   others through the state.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.900]   How do you, are you a big thinker?
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:00.940]   Well, you know, to be honest with you, I wish I had more time to read recently.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.940]   That's my wish.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.580]   But it's because we are doing so many projects now and I just wake up and get on my calls
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:15.740]   and I'm dead and I cannot, but I do think about things trying to get them through and
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:23.220]   I'm trying to encircle myself with people that are really big guys in the arena of constitutional
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.500]   law and diplomacy and cultural connections with other countries.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:34.180]   So I just wish, you know, I had a little bit more time to read, to be honest with you.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.020]   From my perspective, I've been thinking a lot, I first became aware of Lieberland a
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.860]   couple years ago, but I laughed it off a little bit.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.940]   I didn't know, I didn't ever research to know whether to take it seriously or not.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.020]   We met a few days ago and so I've been thinking about some of our conversation.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:26:00.460]   And what is so interesting is it seems like there's actually far fewer things in the world
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.980]   that have to be the way they are than we usually think, right?
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.660]   We're accustomed to the world working the way that it works just because that's how
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.760]   it is.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.100]   But it doesn't actually have to be that way in most circumstances.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.380]   Realistically, things can change.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   I come from the United States of America.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.100]   In the United States of America, if you go back 200 and whatever years ago, you had a
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:31.460]   group of several dozens of men who came together and they said, "We think these certain things
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.720]   should change."
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.780]   And they were able to popularize their ideas, publicize them.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.780]   They were able to recruit enough men to go to war with them.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.100]   Then the world changed and the history of the world has never been the same.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:50.620]   But at its core, it was a few dozen men who were working together, who believed in a set
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:57.220]   of ideas and ideals, and then were successful at convincing those other people.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.540]   It started very humbly, right?
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.180]   There was a relatively small area of territory, but then those men continued to expand.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.700]   They eventually took over an entire continent, plus some additional territories and other
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.860]   places through a variety of means.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.900]   And so the interesting thing about it is that there's no fundamental reason why Liberland
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.760]   the nation couldn't grow in physical geography.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.940]   One thing you think about of a country, "Oh, it's a big area."
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.600]   Well, it's not a big area, as we talked about with Monaco.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.880]   It's not a big area.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.400]   You also think about a country has to be all in one place.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.080]   Well, it doesn't, right?
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.680]   When you think about it, there are exclaves and enclaves of countries all around the world,
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:42.260]   including most, the United States has its own exclaves and enclaves in other places.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:49.320]   And so the nation of Liberland can begin with a small island and some territory near the
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.360]   Danube River on the border between Croatia and Serbia, but the nation of Liberland can
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:00.300]   then go and purchase land from another nation and spread in other ways and in other places.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.520]   And so what's fascinating to me is that when I sit down and think about it, there's no
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.320]   fundamental reason why somebody can't create a new country, why they can't build it on
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.800]   certain shared principles and values that bring people together.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   And even that, right?
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.360]   One of the things that's been so painful for me, and I'm just telling you a little of my
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:24.600]   story and thinking about it, I come from the United States of America, but I really don't
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:30.920]   feel very much kinship with US Americans, many of them, anymore.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.980]   Because I'm not united by the fact that we both carry a blue passport with a golden eagle
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   on its front.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.840]   I'm not united by the stars and stripes.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.440]   I'm united by a set of ideas, a set of ideals.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.080]   And when I talk to people who share those ideas and ideals, I feel a sense of kinship
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   with them.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.840]   But when they don't share them, I feel alienated.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.200]   So I feel more kinship with you being from the Czech Republic.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   - You must be liberal-minded.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.360]   - No, I certainly am.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.620]   And so I guess that's just a way of saying that I love seeing what you're doing.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:09.520]   I admire your big thinking to be willing to spearhead things.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   And I would love to see things change because the world can change faster than we usually
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.120]   think it can.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.920]   And 50 years from now, a totally different world order, right?
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.560]   We talk a lot about the new world order.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.880]   Well, 50 years from now, there's going to be a new world order.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.080]   But I don't believe that new world order is determined.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.320]   I believe that, meaning it's not set in stone what it's going to be.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.380]   Rather that new world order of 50 years hence is going to be determined by what billions
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.640]   of individuals choose to do.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:47.840]   And today, small groups of men have the ability to influence tens of thousands of people,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.680]   have the ability to attract hundreds of thousands of citizens very quickly.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.200]   And so I'd love to see the project flourish and succeed.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   - Thank you very much.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.360]   And I hope to see you in Liberland soon later.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.480]   - I would like to be there.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.200]   So if my listeners want to get information on Liberland, what's the best way for them
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   to do that?
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200]   - Liberland.org.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   That's still, you know.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   - Liberland.org.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   L-I-E-B-E-R-L-A-N-D.org.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.280]   - Yes, it takes, you know, five minutes to register, actually.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.680]   And you start your pass for citizenship.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   You first get e-residency.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.760]   It costs actually $150.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.200]   In 14 days, you should receive the card.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.320]   Then you can use the whatever facilities we have to start a new company, for example,
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   in Liberland.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.560]   And if you start paying taxes, those taxes go towards your citizenship.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.760]   So you can also decide to basically do it gradually when you feel like you are making
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.280]   value inside of the ecosystems, which also many people do.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.080]   Or you can just decide, "Oh, I'm going for it right away.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.080]   I want to be a citizen."
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.280]   Get the passport, and you add another 5,000 merits to your account.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.280]   - Awesome.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.560]   Vy, thank you so much for coming on the show.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   I really appreciate it.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.560]   - Thank you very much.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.560]   It was a great pleasure.

[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.880]   - The mythology of the West left out a lot of the people.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.240]   - People said they'd never seen a black cowboy.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.560]   - This is the history book, but did you know about these other facts?
