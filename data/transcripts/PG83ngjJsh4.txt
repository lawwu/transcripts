[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Welcome back to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.600]   This is a really good question from a listener named Danny.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.960]   Hello Pastor John and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.160]   My question is this,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.520]   what is the sin that does not lead to death
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480]   in 1 John 5 verses 16 and 17?
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.000]   Can you explain the difference between
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.800]   a sin that leads to death and a sin that doesn't?
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.720]   Well, let me venture an answer in summary form
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.680]   and then drop back and give the foundations for it
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.360]   from the context of 1 John
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.580]   and the wider New Testament teaching.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.520]   Here's my answer.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.320]   The sin that does not lead to death,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.200]   that is eternal death,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.520]   which is what I think John means, damnation.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.760]   The sin that does not lead to damnation
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.580]   is any sin that we commit,
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.000]   which we are by grace capable of truly confessing
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.860]   and repenting from.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.900]   That's my answer.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.200]   And the reason I put it like that
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.260]   is because of what 1 John 1:9 says
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.000]   and Hebrews 12, 16 says.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.880]   So 1 John 1:9 says, if we confess our sins,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.720]   he doesn't specify any particular kind,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.640]   just if we confess our sins,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.440]   he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.680]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.880]   So that's a very sweeping and glorious
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.340]   and wonderful and precious promise.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.080]   If you can confess your sin authentically,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.960]   agree with God that it is sin, it stinks,
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.800]   I hate it and turn from it, fight against it,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.260]   you will be forgiven.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.900]   However, Hebrews 12, 16 says,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.360]   talking about Esau in the Old Testament
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   and what happened to him,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   see to it that no one is sexually immoral or unholy
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.360]   like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   For you know that afterward,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.360]   when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   For he found no place for repentance,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320]   though he sought it with tears.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   When it says he sought it, it means he sought repentance,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.620]   but he couldn't find it.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.700]   He was no longer capable of repenting.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.600]   It's not that he repented and repented
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200]   and cried over his repentance and God wouldn't forgive him.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.920]   No, no, no, he could not repent.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.160]   He had sinned to a depth or a degree
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.640]   that God had given him up.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.600]   That's what I think Jesus meant by unforgivable sin,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.800]   not a particular sin, like some particular ugly act,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   not a particular sin, but a particular depth or degree
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.160]   or aggravation or persistence in sin
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.080]   to the point where authentic confession
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.780]   and repentance have become impossible.
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.760]   So my answer to Danny's question,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.360]   what's the sin that does not lead to death
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   is any sin that we are still by grace
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   able to authentically, humbly confess and repent from,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.520]   that sin does not lead to death.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.280]   Now, let's look at the context
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   because it really helps to see how the very text
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.160]   that Danny is referring to
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.600]   fits into the larger theme of 1 John.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.440]   It goes like this,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.080]   "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin,"
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   now that translation, a sin,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.120]   I would translate it committing sin
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.700]   because if you say a sin,
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.320]   it sounds like there's a specific one in mind.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   There is no word a or a in Greek.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.440]   There's no indefinite particle in Greek.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.320]   And so you have to decide contextually
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.160]   whether you add it or not.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.320]   And here I wouldn't add it.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.120]   So let me translate it that way.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.880]   If anyone sees his brother committing sin,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.560]   not leading to death,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   he shall ask and God will give him life
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.840]   to those that do not lead to death,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.080]   to those who commit sins that do not lead to death.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.800]   There is sin that leads to death.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.680]   And I do not say that you should pray for that.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.640]   All wrongdoing is sin,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   but there is sin that does not lead to death.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   Now we need to make sure that we see these two verses
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.480]   as part of the larger balancing act
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   that John is doing in this letter.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.800]   On the one hand, there's a strong emphasis in 1 John
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.640]   that those who are truly born of God don't go on sinning.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.760]   1 John 3.9, if you're born of God,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   you don't go on committing sin, practicing sin.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.400]   And on the other hand, that's one side of the balance,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.600]   John warns against misunderstanding that
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.160]   in a perfectionistic way as though,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.720]   oh, Christians don't sin anymore.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.680]   I've actually met people who say that.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.240]   If we say we have no sin, this is now chapter one, verse seven.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.920]   If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.640]   And the truth is not in us.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.840]   If we confess our sins,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   he's faithful and just to forgive our sins
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.040]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.480]   But if we say we have not sinned,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.720]   we make him a liar and his truth is not in us.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.920]   So that's the other side of the balance.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.960]   On the one side, you don't keep on sinning
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.800]   if you're born again.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.960]   And on the other side,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   you don't ever stop sinning in this world.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.080]   In other words, John is trying to strike a balance
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   between the absolute necessity of the new birth,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.360]   which necessarily gives us significant measures
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.720]   of victory over sin.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.240]   That's the one side.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.160]   And on the other hand,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.480]   the reality that we do in fact, as Christians,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   commit sins and can find forgiveness as we confess them.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.440]   That's the balance you find in chapter five,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.160]   verses 16 and 17.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   So verse 16 begins with,
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.200]   if anyone sees his brother committing sin,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.160]   not leading to death,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.040]   he shall ask God and he will forgive him
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.120]   to those who commit sins that do not lead to death.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.920]   In other words, yes, there is such a thing
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.480]   as a Christian sinning and not being damned for it.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   Then verse 17 ends like this,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.760]   all wrongdoing is sin,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.280]   but there is sin that does not lead to death.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.520]   So John's striking the note firmly,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.360]   we should not take anything he has said
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.120]   in a perfectionistic way
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.520]   that implies Christians don't sin
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.520]   or that all sin leads to damnation.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.360]   It doesn't.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   Christians do sin and not all sin leads to damnation.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.320]   But right there in the middle,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.400]   verse 16, near the end of the verse,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.960]   he puts in a disclaimer.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.040]   He says, "When I tell you to pray for sinners,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   I recognize that Jesus taught about unforgivable sin.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.400]   And I recognize that Hebrews taught about Esau.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.280]   And I do acknowledge that there is sin
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.120]   that does lead to death,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.920]   does lead to damnation,
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.080]   that puts you beyond repentance.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.360]   And I'm not talking about that."
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.560]   That's the point of that verse.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   I'm not talking about that
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.440]   when I tell you to pray for those who have sinned.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.760]   He doesn't tell us not to pray for such sin.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.520]   He simply says, "That's not what I'm talking about
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.400]   when I tell you to pray for sinners
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.840]   that God will give them life."
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.040]   So to state my answer to Danny's specific question
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.360]   one more time,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.200]   his question is,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.840]   "What is the sin that does not lead to death?"
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.920]   Does not lead to death.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.240]   The sin that does not lead to death,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.440]   does not lead to damnation,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.480]   is any sin that we commit,
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.640]   which by God's grace,
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   we are capable of truly confessing and repenting from.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.840]   If we confess our sins,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.280]   He is faithful and just,
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.960]   and will forgive our sins
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.120]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   1 John 1:9 is a very, very precious promise.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.520]   - Yes, it is very precious.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.280]   Thank you, Pastor John, for the answer.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.040]   And thank you for listening
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.280]   and making the podcast part of your week.

[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.080]   and search our past episodes in our archive,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.360]   and even reach us by email
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.200]   with a question you may have of your own,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.000]   questions relating to how scripture connects
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.920]   with our lives and our behaviors.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.000]   You can do all of that
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.080]   Well, what does Paul mean when he says,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.240]   "To live is Christ."
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.160]   To live is Christ.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.760]   It's such a profound statement,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.120]   but even that statement is shrouded in some confusion
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.320]   at first blush when we first look at it,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.960]   but it's worth a closer look.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.880]   And we will on Wednesday.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.480]   I am your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
