[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   A lot of the most successful people are learn-it-alls.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.400]   They're not know-it-alls.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.600]   And the only way they can likely do that
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.560]   is if they have intellectual curiosity.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.960]   - There's sometimes a stigma in companies
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.640]   where the people that ask the questions
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.680]   don't know anything.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.120]   - I think the opposite.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.720]   As a matter of fact, the CEO of Wealthfront
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.080]   became the CEO because he asked such tough questions.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   The best judge of how good someone is
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.880]   probably be how quickly have they ascended in their career.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.040]   - In this day and age, I constantly see people
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.880]   just want more benefits, more work-life balance,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880]   all this stuff.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   - I think work-life balance is really hard
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.600]   if you wanna be really successful.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600]   Again, really successful.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.040]   Every book on entrepreneurship would lead you to believe
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.280]   that successful companies start by looking for a problem
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.600]   and developing a solution.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.640]   In practice, that's not how the great technology companies
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.480]   were founded.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.560]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.160]   I'm a big believer that you learn far more from success
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   than you do from failure professionally.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.280]   I think you learn more from failure personally.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.280]   In my experience, the person who rises the fastest is...
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.760]   - Andy, thanks for being here.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.960]   - My pleasure.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.760]   - Last time we talked a lot about investing
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.560]   and we'll have a few investing questions.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040]   But when I think of all the advice I've gotten from you,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.000]   everything I've learned from you over the years,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.760]   there's all these little pieces of things that I'm like,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.960]   ooh, I wanna draw on that.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.480]   It's almost like even as an employee
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.840]   without a one-on-one relationship,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000]   I've heard multiple people be like,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   gosh, Andy's mentored me so much
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.280]   in the wise knowledge he has.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.040]   I wanna start with one bit of things you've said.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.120]   You've said that intellectual curiosity
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.920]   is above all the thing you value.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.520]   Why have you leveled that up to be the most important thing?
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   - I am a big fan of learn-it-alls versus know-it-alls.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.840]   Learn-it-alls get better, know-it-alls don't.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.600]   And so when you hire someone or work with someone,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200]   you want someone who has a big ceiling
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.760]   or a very tall ceiling that they can grow into.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.360]   And the only way for them to grow
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.080]   is for them to better themselves.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.200]   And the only way they can likely do that
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.600]   is if they have intellectual curiosity.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.560]   - And can someone kind of change their habits
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.160]   to be more intellectually curious,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.800]   or is it kind of ingrained in who we are?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.040]   - But I would imagine if it's important enough,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.720]   you can prioritize it.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   When raising our children,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.480]   it was really important to my wife and me
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.080]   to ingrain that in our kids.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.160]   - And how did you do that?
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.760]   - By constantly encouraging questions.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.160]   - Of any type? - Of any type.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.480]   Some people discourage questions.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.440]   They think that it's annoying.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.240]   And I think it's great.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.760]   I love when people ask me questions.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.200]   And my kids are pretty inquisitive.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   For example, I remember my son's,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.200]   a number of the coaches of my son's teams
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.160]   would start a season out by saying,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280]   "You don't ask me questions.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.800]   I ask you questions."
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.240]   That's really dumb. (laughs)
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.200]   How's the kid gonna get better?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.880]   - I think there's sometimes a stigma in companies
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.760]   where the people that ask the questions
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.160]   don't know anything.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.120]   I think the opposite.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   As a matter of fact, the CEO of Wealthfront
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.200]   became the CEO because he asked such tough questions.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   So he joined us when he was 24 years old
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.880]   as a junior engineer.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.680]   Every tech company typically has a weekly all-hands.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.880]   And there's always one or two engineers
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.840]   who ask really annoying questions.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.360]   And they're annoying because they hit the raw nerve.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.120]   There's usually an issue with every decision
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.360]   that a management team makes.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.320]   And there's always one or two people
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.640]   who know how to find it.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.000]   And David Fortunato was the guy
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.720]   who always found the raw nerve.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.280]   And after a year of taking these questions,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.120]   I made him the CTO. (laughs)
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.920]   At 25, and he's now our CEO,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.480]   and he's a much better CEO than I ever was.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.920]   - And when it comes to asking questions,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.280]   is that an important skill to develop?
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.040]   - I think so, absolutely.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.360]   - Is it about listening more?
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   Is it about thinking more, preparing in advance?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.000]   - I think all of the above.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.360]   - When you would go into board meetings,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.480]   since I know you've sat on a lot,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.560]   to ask questions, did you plan for those meetings?
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.840]   How much preparation do you put into your work
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.560]   in advance versus kind of just paying attention
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400]   in the moment?
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.200]   - I tried pre-internet to read as much
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.800]   as I possibly could about my companies
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.640]   through analyst reports or back when journalists
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.040]   actually wrote objective articles.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.800]   But I would try to be as well prepared as I could.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.080]   And so that I could ask questions.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.720]   And I used to take copious notes,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.840]   and that was before we were told we couldn't
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.560]   because of lawsuits, which was really frustrating for me.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.680]   But I always made sure to read the materials
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.080]   in advance and be prepared.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.560]   Now, a board meeting isn't necessarily the place
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.680]   where you want to interrupt the flow
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.840]   with a lot of questions.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.080]   So maybe the questions are better asked privately
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   versus during the board meeting.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.200]   - Okay, and you talked about taking notes,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.560]   but one of the things I think I evolved my work style
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.840]   working with you is the importance of writing.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.720]   And I was never really a big memo writer
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.840]   or writer about anything.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.520]   And that evolved a lot.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.080]   You had written a ton.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.920]   - I never wrote before I founded WealthThreat.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   - Okay, so what changed?
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.520]   Because I--
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.000]   - Well, as an investor, I didn't have to do it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.200]   I would take notes.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.440]   I would always keep notes on what were the five
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   most important issues that each of my portfolio companies
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.560]   had to address.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.040]   But I didn't have to write beyond that.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.040]   But I always encouraged my CEOs to write their thought,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.600]   their strategy down because the process
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.880]   of writing something down causes you
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.640]   to think through it much better.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.200]   Business plans were fantastic because they really forced you
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.080]   to think everything through.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.760]   When I was in business school, I remember Don Valentine,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   the founder of Sequoia Capital, came and spoke in our class.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   And the topic that he focused on was a recently introduced
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.560]   product called Lotus 1-2-3,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.120]   which was an electronic spreadsheet.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.440]   And he said electronic spreadsheets
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.920]   have ruined entrepreneurship.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.280]   And the reason why was prior to electronic spreadsheets,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.960]   you would do a financial plan on what was known
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.360]   as columnar paper.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.720]   When I used to teach a class on venture capital
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.360]   at Stanford Graduate School of Business, I would bring it.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.200]   And you would create a financial plan
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   on this columnar paper, just like you would
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.920]   with a spreadsheet with rows and columns.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.800]   But if you were going to write it down,
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.360]   you had better have thought everything through
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.120]   in a way that you don't with an electronic spreadsheet.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.240]   You can get lazy because you can quickly change
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.800]   an assumption and it flows through the entire plan.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.960]   But when you have to write it down with a pencil
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.880]   on columnar paper, you really had to have thought
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.360]   through your assumptions.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.400]   So being purposeful about it led to a far better
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   thought out financial plan than when you did it
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.560]   with an electronic spreadsheet.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   And this is what really annoyed Don.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.640]   And I think just as it's really valuable
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.520]   for doing a financial plan, it's really valuable
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.160]   for doing the strategic plan.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.400]   What's important?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.480]   Why is it important?
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.840]   How does it impact other functions?
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.440]   And writing these things down, PowerPoint doesn't for,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.800]   it's like the spreadsheet.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.520]   You don't have to think it through when you write bullets.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.160]   - And do you apply that at all in your personal life?
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.120]   Like what are our goals as a, you know, family
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.440]   or anything like that and use it there
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.280]   or do you just use it in work?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.480]   - Just work.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.240]   - Do you think it would have an impact
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.320]   in your personal life if you wrote down
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.000]   what do we want to accomplish this year?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.960]   - Oh, I'd be a real grind if I did that.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.880]   - Okay, okay.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.080]   - I tend not to have long-term goals
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.640]   'cause they change so much every year
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.600]   based on what's going on.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.720]   - So I think that's probably a hot take,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.040]   which is I talk to lots of people and they're like,
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.320]   here are my goals and here's what I'm gonna take steps
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.480]   to get to them and here's how I'm planning out life
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.360]   and everything, no long-term goals.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.080]   How do you, especially earlier in your career,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.560]   how do you think, where do I want to go?
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.120]   Are you just thinking about what's next?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.960]   - Well, you know, it's really funny.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.640]   When I was younger in the school year,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.600]   I would sort of pick a topic,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   something that I wanted to get better at
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.760]   and I would focus on that for the year.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.080]   And I started getting too busy to do that around 45.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.320]   - I wonder, I mean, Zuckerberg did this for a while
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.960]   where he's like, this is the year I'm gonna hunt.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.880]   This is the year I'm gonna do the, you know,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   learn a language.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.160]   - Yes, I used to do that.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.320]   - It seems like he fits your intellectual curiosity.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   - Oh, he's the biggest sponge I've ever heard about.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.760]   I haven't met him, but the people I know who know him well
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.960]   describe that as his greatest attribute.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.840]   - And would you say that's a common thread
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.520]   amongst people you've met
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.720]   that are either successful or fulfilled?
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   - I think a lot of the most successful people
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.840]   are learn-it-alls.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.680]   They're not know-it-alls.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.440]   I think there's an enormous difference
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.760]   between someone who's a promoter,
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.920]   an outstanding promoter,
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.600]   versus someone who is really good at what they do.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.440]   - One of the things I've heard you say in the past
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.200]   is that one of the only ways to make money
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.360]   is to be non-consensus.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.320]   It seems like you have a lot of non-consensus takes.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   In general, today it seems like everything around us
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.840]   is trying to show us content that's similar
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.640]   to how we believe.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.280]   How do you force yourself to do that?
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.880]   - I'm intellectually curious.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.240]   It all comes back to the first point.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.400]   So, I don't accept what I'll see.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.600]   I mean, I don't use social media very much,
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.440]   barely at all anymore.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.320]   So, I don't believe what someone pushes in front of me.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.480]   I wanna do my independent homework,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.920]   and I wanna do my homework by going to experts,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.480]   not my friends.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.960]   One of the biggest differences I notice
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.720]   in the millennial generation versus a baby boomer,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.360]   and I'm a baby boomer,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   is that baby boomers go to experts for advice,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.560]   whereas millennials, my kids are millennials,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.520]   they go to their friends.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.080]   Well, what do your friends know?
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.640]   It makes no sense to me.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   I would go to my friends to find the experts,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.080]   but I wouldn't go to my friends for advice.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.200]   - Interesting.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.800]   I'm trying to think about how this plays out.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.320]   It's like, is it because it became a popularity thing,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.640]   where it's like, what I actually want
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.440]   is actually the thing my friends care about?
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.280]   - I don't know.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.760]   I don't know if it's partially enabled
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.040]   by the prevalence of social media,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.560]   that you're so used to asking your friends so many things,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.720]   why not ask them for advice about, should I change jobs?
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.480]   What kind of job should I change to?
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.840]   How should I think about doing something?
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.200]   It's amazing to me how many people,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.120]   how many of my students at Stanford
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.560]   rely on what their friends tell them,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.000]   and their friends are not well-versed,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.320]   or how many people I've attempted to recruit to Wealthfront,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   or people who've worked at Wealthfront
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.960]   have based decisions based on what their friends,
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.320]   who really don't have any expertise, have told them.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.920]   So, for example, a lot of people in Silicon Valley
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.880]   believe in this narrative that you should have experience
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.400]   in small companies and large companies.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.080]   That makes no sense to me.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.120]   The way that I've observed is you're either
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.800]   a small company person or a big company person.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.360]   The things that make you enjoy small companies
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.680]   would make you not like working in a big company,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.160]   and vice versa.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   So the idea that you should have both experiences
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.200]   is crazy to me, but it's a very common narrative,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.960]   and it's reinforced by friend networks
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.000]   of people who haven't necessarily had success.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.600]   - And to push a little bit
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.640]   on the big versus small company thing,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.320]   I think I found I didn't work well in a big company.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:19.120]   Is it possible if someone thinks they don't do well in one,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.920]   the answer is the other, or are there traits of someone
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.680]   who does well in big versus small?
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.800]   - I think the latter.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.640]   - Okay.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   - And if you talk to somebody who understood the two
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.560]   and could help you think it through,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.480]   they might actually help you understand that sooner.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.880]   - Are there any traits you've seen of people
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.320]   that enjoy one or the other?
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.520]   - Yes, and there's no value judgment in this.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.840]   If you enjoy being a hero,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.120]   you're gonna enjoy being in a small company more.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   If you enjoy being associated with success
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.760]   and you wanna be part of an organization
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.440]   that can move the market, you'll like big companies.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.440]   You can't have, you can't be part of an organization
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.720]   that moves the markets and be a hero.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.280]   They're really in conflict with one another.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.880]   - Unless maybe you're the person running the organization,
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.240]   but I imagine most people listening aren't in a position
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.800]   to immediately become a person running a company
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.640]   that moves markets.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.480]   - Right.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.680]   - You mentioned companies that are moving the markets,
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.720]   companies that are successful.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.880]   - By the way, there's different strokes for different folks.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.400]   So I'm not trying to comment on one is better than the other.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   I think you need to be intellectually honest about yourself
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.680]   to determine where you should be.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.080]   - So you're talking about companies that are successful.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.200]   How important for someone in their career
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.880]   do you think it is to experience working
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.560]   at a successful company versus seeing more failures
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.880]   at a company they're working at?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.720]   - All right, I have strong opinions on this.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   I think I know what you're getting at.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   So I have another very non-consensus point of view
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.640]   on this topic.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.200]   I'm a big believer that you learn far more from success
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.920]   than you do from failure professionally.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.120]   I think you learn more from failure personally.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.880]   I think that the general worldview
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.200]   is you learn more from failure.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.600]   But if I'm interviewing you to come work for me,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.680]   I don't want to hire someone who knows what not to do.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.040]   I wanna hire someone who knows what to do.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.600]   I want you to bring your expertise,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.160]   your special skill that you learned from success
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.920]   and apply it to my company.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.640]   There's far more leverage from lessons of success.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.320]   And so I am way biased toward people
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.760]   who've worked at successful companies.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.360]   And I think that most people don't understand
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   that knowledgeable hiring managers have that bias.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.640]   - And so if you're someone who's working at a company
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.240]   that was a failure and you wanna overcome that bias
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.680]   in your direction, are there things to highlight?
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   - Yes, you might take a little bit later stage job
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.280]   at something that you think has a very high likelihood
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.480]   of being success.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.840]   You have to be a little bit more patient
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.840]   because you might get less financial reward for doing that,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.920]   but you have to re-cloak yourself in success.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.720]   One of the things that I see some former students of mine do,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.440]   which I think is an enormous mistake,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.720]   is they join companies pre-product market fit.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.480]   And I think this is an intelligence test
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.000]   because you only get a little bit less equity
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.360]   joining a company post-product market fit than pre.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.300]   So why would you ever join pre?
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.080]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   And the best people know that they can command a job
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.000]   a company that has lower risk
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.760]   by virtue of it having gotten product market fit.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.040]   The vast majority of companies
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.000]   do not find product market fit and therefore fail.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.640]   I think it's the biggest determinant of success.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   And then they see their peers from business school,
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   their classmates, and their friends might've moved on
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.160]   to now commanding a title of director.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.520]   And they think, you know, I'm three or four years
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.280]   post-graduation, I should be a director.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   Well, no good company that has a lot of momentum
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.520]   is gonna hire from a crappy company.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.180]   So the only place they can command that title
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.200]   is another crappy company.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.720]   So they sort of reinforce this thing
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.920]   and they never find success.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.480]   And once you do it two times,
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.160]   it's almost impossible to dig yourself out of that hole.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.120]   - And do you think titles even matter?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.760]   Should that person even care whether-
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.500]   - I don't believe they should.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.200]   Because if you work for a company
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.500]   that becomes really successful,
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:20.440]   A, you get more value from your equity than you expected.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.040]   And B, you get heavily pursued by recruiters
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.680]   because they think those are the best people.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.200]   And you can parlay that into a best next job.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   - Would you think that in today's day and age,
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.960]   I think there's been a lot of influence
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.560]   from just the way technology companies have managed.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.040]   Also, I think so many companies are starting to act
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.640]   like technology companies that aren't.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.880]   - They think they're acting like technology companies.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.760]   - But if someone were working at, you know,
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.840]   on the corporate side of Walmart or Costco,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.120]   the equity piece might not matter as much,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.980]   but are a lot of these lessons still similar, you think?
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.820]   Guess.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.000]   I've got to believe that lessons of success matter
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   and that one should prioritize that in recruiting.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.600]   - So someone might identify,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.320]   I'm interested in bigger companies.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.640]   I'm interested in smaller companies.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.560]   I want to get some good experience.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.200]   Should I go work at OpenAI,
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.520]   even though I have no interest in AI?
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.080]   And not speculating on that company in particular,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   but how important when someone's trying to figure out
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.840]   what to do and where to work is actually loving
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.360]   or believing in or being passionate about
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.000]   what that company does versus it's the right size,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.840]   it's the right type of experience I can get.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.640]   - Well, this is a topic near and dear to my heart
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.180]   because I get asked this all the time by my students.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.080]   I've been teaching at Stanford Graduate School of Business
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.040]   for 19 years now.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.920]   And I took that advice and I codified it
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.240]   into a series of blog posts for Wealthfront
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.000]   that we ultimately made into an e-book
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.320]   called the Silicon Valley Career Guide,
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.160]   which is about 20 or 25 pages.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.720]   And it's a free download if you want to Google it.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.440]   And basically what I tell people
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.320]   is you should prioritize the industry
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.760]   in which you want to work.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.220]   And hopefully it's one that you can work in
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.360]   for 20 or 30 years,
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.200]   but something about which you're incredibly passionate
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.360]   because I'll always take the more passionate
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.560]   over the more talented person
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.280]   if the passionate person has enough talent.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.800]   I want the person who's more passionate
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.560]   because they're more likely to invest the time
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.680]   and effort to get better.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.000]   So three years hence, the passionate person
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.800]   who might be slightly behind the talented person
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.480]   and talent will be above.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.440]   And I have a number of case studies for that.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.920]   So pick an area where you're gonna wanna spend the time
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.540]   getting better.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:02.000]   Then choose the best company in that space
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and title should be, the position should be the last point.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.080]   No company has enough good people.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.500]   And so if you're really passionate
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.200]   and you really improve yourself and you do a great job,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.980]   you'll be able to transition
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.160]   into whatever job you ultimately want.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.800]   This is really hard advice to take.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.480]   And my students who've taken this advice
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.320]   have done exceptionally well.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.440]   - Does that mean that if one day I wanna be
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.240]   a product manager and the only job I can get
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.120]   is working on the research team or something,
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.500]   but I can do it in a field I'm passionate about
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.080]   at a company that seems like it'll suit me well
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.920]   and is growing, that that might be a good path?
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.000]   - I would recommend that, yes.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.520]   - And so what you do is less important?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.040]   - I believe that, yes.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.060]   - Is there a minimum amount of excitement
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.240]   for what someone, you know, I don't care about,
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.400]   you know, I'm making this up,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.240]   like I'm not interested in marketing or PR,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   but that's the only job I can get.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.520]   - You had better be really passionate about the field
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.720]   to overcome that.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.560]   - Okay.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.380]   But if it is a field--
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.880]   - But they wouldn't have hired you into that function
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.560]   had they not thought you had some relevant skill.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.760]   - What about this concept of specializing
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.400]   versus going broad in your career,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.520]   learning five or six different skill sets
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.240]   versus trying to hone your craft at one?
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   - In my experience, the person who rises the fastest
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.800]   is the specialist, is the expert.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.400]   So you wanna become really great at one thing
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.320]   and you hire for all the other stuff.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.240]   - Okay.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.680]   And is that who you would look for to be a leader
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.600]   in the company? - Absolutely, every time.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.920]   - You mentioned asking questions with David,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.380]   someone who's a deep specialist,
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.760]   which having worked with David, I can confirm,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.460]   was definitely a specialist.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.560]   Other things you look for in people
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.520]   that you wanna elevate at a company?
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.560]   - Well, I think those two things lead to upside.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.160]   So I don't understand people who hire people
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.560]   who can fill the job today.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.640]   I think that's a huge mistake, that don't have upside.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.120]   - And meaning take the time to find the right person.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.420]   - It's gonna be more work,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   but it will be well worth your while over time.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.800]   And this is why one of the four values
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.680]   of Wealthfront is endurance. (laughs)
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.400]   - And if someone's on the other side of this,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.520]   is like, "I really want this role,"
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.240]   from all the people that you've seen reach out to you,
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.420]   are there things that stand out as ways
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.480]   for people to get in front of a company?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.400]   - Prove that you're passionate.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.680]   I can't tell you how many people I've interviewed
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.480]   who haven't spent a minute learning about the company.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.960]   And it's just clear that they're window shopping,
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.240]   or they're trying to collect offers.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   So as you learned, if we feel like we're one of five
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.840]   companies that someone's talking to,
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.680]   we no longer spend time with them,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.600]   because we want people who are excited about what we do.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.040]   And they make themselves known.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.160]   And some people get upset with us,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.760]   like, "It's my right to look at a lot of other companies."
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.320]   And we say, "It absolutely is your right to look at all,
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.880]   "but it's our right not to wanna spend
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.760]   "any more time with you too."
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.400]   - You know, what would you tell someone
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.640]   who they know the company they're excited about,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.760]   but odds are not always in your favor?
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.120]   Can you be excited about a few different companies?
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.960]   Not necessarily because--
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.320]   - Within the same field, I believe,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.900]   but if they're in disparate fields,
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.440]   like when I was a venture capitalist,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.480]   I would meet someone who was interviewing
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.880]   at a big company and a small company.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.960]   And the interview was immediately over in my mind,
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.600]   because if they didn't know what they wanted,
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.920]   why should I spend time and effort on them?
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.320]   They clearly weren't passionate about what we were doing.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.960]   They were taking the meeting to sort of educate themselves.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.720]   I'm not here to educate you.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.760]   - It's a great way to save time as a manager.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.240]   - Well, then you never have enough time.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.360]   - Yeah.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   - Now, some people don't like this.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.380]   I'm a really efficient user of time.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.160]   And I don't wanna spend time on something
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.420]   that's not likely to yield.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.520]   Now, there are type two errors.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.320]   So I'm gonna miss some people
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.380]   that maybe we should have gotten.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.320]   But from a probability standpoint,
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.840]   I'm gonna be better off and I'm happy playing the odds.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.520]   - So you said you're an efficient user of time.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.560]   That's an example.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.680]   Are there other things that you do in your work, life, career?
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.580]   - I have really short emails.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.680]   (laughs)
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   - As someone who loves to read or write.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.240]   - I didn't say I love to write.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.600]   I think it's really valuable to.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.640]   So everyone in my family makes fun of me
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.980]   about how short my text messages are and my emails.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.760]   - And I think sometimes people who are writing emails,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.440]   let's say they're writing an email to you
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.280]   and they're like, or five years ago,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.880]   you're at Wealthfront, they wanna work at Wealthfront.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.160]   They hear your email, they wanna send you an email.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.780]   They think, gosh, I've gotta write this email
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.420]   where it's, hey, I'm so excited.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.560]   I really love Wealthfront.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.140]   They end up with four paragraphs and they send it to you.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.400]   Is that really the most productive email they can send you?
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.440]   - It depends.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.640]   How long does it take to express the critical point
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.600]   that they want to express?
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.300]   In my class on product market fit at Stanford,
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.580]   I have, the students have to do a lot of reading
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.260]   for each class and they have to turn in
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.260]   a one to two page paper on a written assignment
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.300]   that you can't do unless you've done the reading.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.820]   Well, I didn't say it has to be two pages.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.740]   Some of the best papers are one paragraph.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.920]   If you can get the point across in one paragraph,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.120]   that shows unbelievable command.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.560]   So a lesson that I learned from one of my partners
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   at Benchmark, Alex Balkansky, that I use often
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:20.140]   is he, it was a result of his childhood.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:25.800]   So Alex grew up in Paris and he's the son
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.860]   of a fairly renowned physicist.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.260]   And so whenever physicists in his dad's field
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.260]   would visit Paris, his dad would invite them over
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.460]   for dinner with his family.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.260]   And one of the things that Alex noticed
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.260]   was that truly exceptional physicists
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.900]   explain complex issues in simple terms.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.100]   Very good physicists explain complex issues
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.020]   in complex terms and good physicists couldn't explain
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.140]   what they were doing at all.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.040]   So I actually took that to heart
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.100]   at the end of my venture capital career
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.400]   that the best entrepreneurs have such great command
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.340]   of their subject that they can explain complex issues
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.420]   in really, really simple terms.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.500]   So I think that actually is a core part of seed investing
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.460]   where you're really investing in the person, not the idea.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.340]   Maybe the insight, but being able to succinctly
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:34.460]   explain the power of the insight is something
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.500]   that only one with tremendous command can do.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.260]   - Okay, if I wanna evaluate myself as an entrepreneur
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.420]   and I'm speaking for anyone listening,
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.140]   do I have high intellectual curiosity?
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.140]   That would be a plus one in the camp.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.860]   Can I be succinct to explain things?
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.940]   - You can only be succinct if you have incredible command.
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.780]   - Okay.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   - And those things maybe put you in a better position
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.440]   to recognize an inflection point in technology
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.540]   that will enable an insight.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.860]   So one of the most controversial points that I make
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.760]   in my product market fit class is that every book
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.360]   on entrepreneurship would lead you to believe
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.100]   that successful companies start by an entrepreneur
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.820]   observing a market, looking for a problem
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.940]   and developing a solution.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.940]   In practice, that's not how the great technology companies
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.980]   were founded, it's the exact opposite.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.780]   The founder typically recognized an inflection point
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.180]   in technology that enabled them to build a new kind
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.860]   of product and then they had to find somebody
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.700]   who cared about it.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.860]   So in effect, it was a solution in search of a problem
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.540]   and you keep iterating on the markets till you find
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.500]   a group that's desperate for what you have.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.640]   But you have to have a really powerful insight
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.260]   in order for that to work.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.300]   - You've said product market fit a lot.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.080]   I know the definition because we've worked together,
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.340]   but for anyone listening who kind of missed
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.540]   the implied definition, how would you think
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.100]   of defining that term?
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.960]   - You have found a market that's desperate for your product.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.640]   - And what question would you ask during an interview
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.940]   to find out whether the company you're potentially
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.620]   gonna work for actually has it?
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.260]   Or would you not even ask the company?
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.780]   - I would absolutely ask the question.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.780]   So over more than 25 years of maniacally studying
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:35.880]   this topic, I have come to two heuristics
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.600]   that I think are pretty good indicators
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.660]   of whether or not you found this.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.660]   So in a consumer business, exponential organic growth
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.580]   and in an enterprise business,
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.700]   a company that sells to businesses,
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.260]   a sales yield greater than one.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.900]   So let me give you a quick fleshing out of that.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.580]   So the two most important things to prove
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.020]   that you have found an audience that's desperate
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.980]   for your product are word of mouth and retention.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.460]   Well, how do you know if there's word of mouth?
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.660]   And word of mouth is five to 10 times
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.060]   more valuable than retention.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.900]   So how do you measure that?
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.160]   Well, in a consumer business,
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.020]   the one metric that really captures it
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.940]   is exponential organic growth.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.380]   Not total growth, 'cause you can game growth.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.180]   You can pay for growth.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.140]   You can acquire customers, but they might not stick around.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.860]   And they might not tell other people to come,
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.860]   in which case, once you turn off the faucet,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.420]   the paid marketing faucet or advertising,
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.780]   the business goes away.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.520]   The only way that a company can grow exponentially
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.140]   organically is word of mouth,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.620]   'cause delight is the greatest form of virality,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.260]   and retention.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.860]   But you're not gonna tell your friends
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.060]   you gotta use this product
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.580]   if you're not gonna stay with the product also, right?
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.980]   So it does an amazing job of capturing it.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.480]   On the enterprise side,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.180]   one of my teaching partners, Mark Leslie,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.180]   wrote an amazing article called
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.060]   "The Sales Learning Curve" in the Harvard Business Review.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:26.060]   And in it, he found that
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:32.820]   when companies selling to businesses get started,
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.380]   it takes them a while 'til they figure out the recipe
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.580]   of how to sell the product or who the target audience is.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.260]   Who's, in my words, who's desperate.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.540]   Because better doesn't matter.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.420]   If there's a good enough alternative,
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.940]   people are gonna buy the good enough alternative
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.300]   from the incumbent because they're trustworthy.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.360]   Why should they buy from you for better?
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.680]   The only way they're gonna buy from you
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.040]   is if they're desperate.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.020]   So it takes a while before you discover who's desperate.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.580]   When you do, your sales yield goes to one.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:10.460]   And sales yield is defined by the dollar contribution
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.620]   per average sales rep divided by the cost
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.580]   to field a sales team.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.500]   So in a direct sales business in technology,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   you typically pay a sales rep between salary
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.500]   and commission on the order of $250,000.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.820]   And then they typically have a sales engineer
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.140]   who does the technical part of the sale.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.740]   And they typically earn on the order
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.580]   of $150,000 to $200,000 total cut.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.780]   And then there's a fraction of an inside sales rep
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.620]   who does qualification.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.740]   And then there's T&E and other expenses like that.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.100]   And then finally, you have to amortize the cost
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.820]   of management across sales teams.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.580]   So the all-in cost is around $600,000.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.620]   And what Mark Leslie and Chuck Holloway,
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.620]   his co-author, found was that until the contribution margin
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:10.660]   is at least equal to the cost to field a team,
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.140]   so until you generate a contribution margin
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:17.340]   of at least $600,000, it doesn't take off.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.420]   But once you get to a yield of one,
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   for some reason there's an inflection point.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.900]   And it's incredibly consistent.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.060]   And then it goes up to two,
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.420]   and then there's an inflection point that slows down.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.860]   And Mark and Chuck found that you should hire
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.860]   a different type of rep pre-achieving sales yield of one.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.220]   It's sort of a hybrid marketer and salesperson.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   You don't want to hire a whole sales force
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.940]   until you get to the yield of one
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.700]   because then you waste a lot of money.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.020]   So they call that the renaissance rep.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.740]   Then you hire an enlightened rep, a classic rep,
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.260]   who can sell the merits of a product.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.220]   And then once you get to a sales yield of two
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.340]   and things start to plateau,
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.220]   then you just hire order takers.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.260]   And they call those coin-operated reps.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.020]   So you really need to know where you are in this phase.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.380]   But for some reason, there's an inflection point at one.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.580]   Inflections matter more than almost anything in business.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.220]   Wherever you see an inflection,
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.500]   drop everything and focus on that.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.260]   So that tells me that you're out of the discovery phase
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.380]   and you've found product-market fit.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.820]   - So do you think companies can just answer these?
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.340]   Oh, what is the sales yield?
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.940]   - Good companies can.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:35.300]   Companies that don't want to answer those questions
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.620]   generally don't want to
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.700]   because they can't answer them well.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.340]   - So is that a red flag or a yellow flag?
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.700]   - I think red.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.540]   - Okay.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.620]   - Now, many companies would say,
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.220]   if you hear, "Oh, that's confidential,"
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.900]   that's bullshit. (laughs)
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.340]   - Yeah, I mean, sometimes maybe the hiring person
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.020]   you're talking to doesn't know the answer
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.860]   and they can go get it.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.900]   - Well, then do you want to work for somebody who lies?
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.940]   Instead of saying, "I don't know.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.780]   "Let me find out and I'll get back to you,"
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.340]   that's a high-quality person,
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.660]   the person who says it's confidential
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.420]   because they're insecure.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.660]   Do you want to work for a company
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.380]   that employs people like that?
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.700]   I don't.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.140]   - Well, you probably don't want to work anywhere anymore.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.980]   - Yeah, but even when I was working,
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.300]   I wouldn't want to work with people like that.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.700]   - As you're talking about some of these lessons
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.820]   for tech companies,
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.060]   I think about a few friends of mine work outside of tech,
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.700]   and one of them works in oil and gas,
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.260]   but they're running it like a tech company now,
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.860]   and in many ways-
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   - What does that mean?
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.900]   - So a little bit that the way they think about management,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.660]   the way they think about leveling,
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.620]   it just is all the same language
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.940]   that I've heard in this industry that we've worked in.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.260]   I also think that these days, some of these companies,
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.620]   it's hard to tell what a tech company is
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.420]   because if it's actually selling oil and gas technology to,
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.260]   it is a tech company,
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.100]   it just happens to be in this other industry,
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.300]   and I think it's interesting
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.900]   that I don't want people to be too turned off
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.940]   by us talking about tech companies and think,
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.860]   "Well, this is just small tech startups
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.820]   that you can work at,"
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.100]   'cause you might not necessarily have the experience
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.300]   outside of Silicon Valley
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.300]   to know that these lessons transition,
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.940]   but my instinct is that a lot of what we're talking about
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.060]   would be relevant in many other industries.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.220]   - I'll let you make that assertion.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.260]   I try to stick to what I know,
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.260]   and I'm not a fan of people who are know-it-alls.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.820]   I said that earlier.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.740]   So I haven't learned about those fields.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.340]   I'm not gonna make any assertions.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.700]   - You mentioned a little earlier some of these heuristics
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.460]   of people that, or companies that are successful.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.900]   What about other heuristics of either companies
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.140]   or managers that people should look at
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.500]   of what makes people successful in their roles?
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   - I think the best judge of how good someone is
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.180]   is if you only had one metric to look at,
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.620]   would probably be how quickly
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.860]   have they ascended in their career.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.100]   - Which is a very easy thing to get data on.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.900]   - Very easy, but very few people ask about it.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.540]   So one of the things that I used to ask executives
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.180]   who I interviewed for portfolio companies
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.140]   when I was a venture capitalist also was,
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.980]   tell me about the best person who ever worked for you.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.500]   What do they do now?
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.620]   And if they were still below them,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.100]   that didn't speak well of the executive
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.380]   because they didn't develop people.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.500]   If they could tell me a story about someone
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.140]   who might even be at a higher level than they today,
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.940]   that was really powerful.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.580]   So that was true of, that's true of more senior people.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.540]   But in general, I would say the rate
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.540]   at which one ascends in their career.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.780]   - We talked a lot about management, managers, hiring.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.020]   What role in work is there for people
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.340]   who don't want to manage,
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.060]   but want to excel in their career and their craft?
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.460]   - Boy, I'm having a hard time with that one.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.900]   This is something that is particularly timely to me
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.460]   because I don't understand how someone becomes
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.740]   a VP of engineering today in a software company
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.540]   because most good engineers, and I'm saying most, not all,
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.660]   have no respect for managers (laughs)
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:41.660]   and often think of managers as an HR position.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.720]   It's an administrative position.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   And therefore, they aspire to be tech leads and not managers.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.760]   They aspire to lead a project,
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.800]   but technically lead it, not manage it.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:03.920]   Well, I don't know what career path that leads
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.880]   to being a chief technical officer
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   because you can't become a VP of engineering.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.880]   You want to be a tech lead who also can manage people.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.840]   So perhaps we need hybrid tech lead managers,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:28.960]   but the trend today in most software companies
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.400]   is towards separating managers from tech leads.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.960]   So I'm thoroughly confused about how one ascends
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.320]   in their career in engineering.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.760]   - And even outside of engineering,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.000]   do you think management is a required stop
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.760]   on the seniority level system?
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.260]   - Yes, but again, I think you want to focus on the skill
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.780]   at which you're a killer and hire the rest.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:01.780]   So if you're a marketer and you happen to be
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:06.000]   a superb product marketer, then you don't necessarily
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.360]   have to be the best at paid marketing
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   or marketing to the existing customers,
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.660]   programs of that sort.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:22.840]   You can, I think, do really well by aspiring
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:29.720]   to hire in to manage people who do those things.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.240]   But if you're great at one thing,
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.480]   you're much more likely to be promoted quickly,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.560]   which leads back to the metric I talked about.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.880]   - Yeah, I just wonder if sometimes people end up
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.200]   in a place where, wow, you're so good at this thing.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.040]   We're going to elevate you.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.600]   Now you run the team.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.480]   And that's just a totally different skillset.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.720]   - Well, this gets back to tech lead.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.240]   So let's draw the analogy that that's why I think
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   the ideal manager is both a technical expert and a manager.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.480]   If they're just a manager
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.840]   and they're not an expert in their function,
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.160]   I don't think that usually leads to good outcomes.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.780]   - Okay, so if you're taking on too many employees under you
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.680]   that you don't have any time to actually do the work.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.120]   - Or think about it.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.240]   - Okay.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:21.160]   - Where you can help someone below you at what they do.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.960]   So imagine you manage product managers.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.200]   Well, you better have some really good instincts
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.720]   about products to be able to help them,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.280]   the people who report to you.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.120]   - Yeah.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.640]   - If you're just managing them,
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.360]   then your reports aren't going to get
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.320]   a lot of value from you.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.640]   And I don't think you're that valuable.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.200]   - Rates of leaders that you've worked with
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.280]   or seen are valuable.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.680]   - Perhaps the two most important characteristics
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.640]   of a good leader are their ability to set expectations well,
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.320]   because do you want to follow someone
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.080]   who doesn't set good expectations
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.480]   and someone who communicates really well?
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.640]   - And if you are an employee somewhere listening to this.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.080]   - And then I guess the third point would be
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.480]   they put others ahead of themselves.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.840]   So I'm going to make that three points.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.560]   - And can you influence those
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.200]   as someone who reports to that person,
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.880]   if they're not setting expectations,
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.360]   is it find a new manager or is it?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.720]   - Well, you can ask to transfer.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.480]   - But kind of influencing and changing your manager's style.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.920]   - Just like I don't believe in pips.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.240]   - Okay, say more.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.440]   - I've seldom if ever seen
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:45.080]   a performance improvement program ever work.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   That once you start questioning whether someone
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.680]   who works for you is up to the task,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.040]   you've made up your mind.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.960]   You know the answer actually.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.120]   - And is the right move there as a manager
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.080]   to just let them know that and let them go?
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.160]   - Yes, and help them find something where they can excel.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.720]   It's not usually a bad person.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.760]   It just might not be a great fit.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.720]   - So I think very rarely does someone have a manager
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.040]   who's like, ah, you're not cut out for this job.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:13.880]   - They should.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.800]   - Let me help you.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.640]   No, no, no.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.520]   The first part I think you might hear frequently,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.320]   but the let me help you.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.280]   I think you've talked about the golden rule a lot.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.520]   Is that where that belief comes from?
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.680]   - I just think it's the right thing to do.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I just feel like in--
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.520]   - Treat, I guess you're right.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.640]   So as you said, I'm an enormous believer
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.200]   in the golden rule of treating others
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.880]   the way you'd like to be treated.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.360]   And if I had a boss,
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.080]   that's what I would want them to do for me.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.600]   So yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.880]   - And do you, I know you've said intellectual--
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.800]   - Thank you for leading me through this, Chris.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.240]   (laughing)
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.280]   - I did a lot of homework.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.480]   - I just know that you talk about that
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.520]   in a lot of the ways you make decisions.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.320]   You just think about it from other people's perspective.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.640]   - Exactly.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.960]   And don't you wish the world operated that way?
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.480]   Wouldn't we have avoided a lot of the problems
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.680]   that we have in this country?
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.560]   If everyone treated others
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.280]   the way they would like to be treated,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.760]   God, we're going in the opposite direction.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.480]   - And what can we do about that?
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.320]   - I don't know.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.480]   We need leaders.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.960]   (laughing)
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.880]   We need really good leaders to set examples,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.480]   but our leaders are doing the opposite.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.200]   - And is there a thing, are there short-term fixes?
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.280]   I mean, a long-term fix is,
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.680]   oh, if you think you could do the opposite,
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.520]   become a leader,
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.800]   but does the system kind of corrupt
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.280]   your leadership along the way?
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.160]   - Perhaps, at least politically,
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.560]   I think that's really challenging today.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.080]   - And do you see any path forward?
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.000]   - I know very little about politics,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.840]   so I'm not going to comment on that.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.680]   - Okay, okay.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   (laughing)
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.160]   Well, I actually had a point
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.040]   that maybe politics will bring up,
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.200]   which without talking about it is,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.520]   I haven't heard you talk much about optimism and pessimism
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.200]   and how important one side or the other is in business.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.520]   - I'm an optimist.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.640]   David Fortunato, Wealthfront's CEO,
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.920]   comes across as a pessimist.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.480]   I don't think he really is.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.680]   (laughing)
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.640]   - Is that his questioning nature?
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.600]   - Perhaps.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.760]   He's skeptical and somewhat cynical.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.400]   - Yeah, I've heard people-
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.920]   - It's hard to have a growth mindset if you're a pessimist.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.400]   - When I think about intellectual curiosity,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.160]   it's like, I want to know if there's a better answer.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.040]   I want to know how to do this.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.720]   - David Fortunato, who I talked about earlier, our CEO,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.880]   I'm in awe of him.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.080]   I mean, he's unbelievably well-read, learned and all,
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   and just has a voracious appetite to add to his knowledge.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.840]   And he is loathe to comment on things
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.320]   about which he is not educated,
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.080]   and tries to surround himself with people who are.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.000]   - We asked about whether asking questions
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.160]   makes you look bad.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.960]   I think I know the answer to this question, but-
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.840]   - By the way, one of the things that is terrible,
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.720]   you have two little girls, I have a daughter,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.520]   and when my daughter was in middle school,
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.280]   her friends would say, "Stop raising your hand.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.440]   You shouldn't be doing that.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.920]   It's like, it's inappropriate."
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.360]   There's a bunch of social mores
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.080]   that make it really hard for women to stand out
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.440]   and do some of the things that I think are needed for them
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.840]   to achieve everything they're capable of achieving.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.200]   - So is your advice to your daughter,
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.400]   just don't listen to that, raise your hand,
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.240]   ask the question. - Absolutely.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.320]   But to a middle schooler, that's really, really hard.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.480]   - Yeah, I haven't had to give advice
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.240]   to a middle school daughter.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.640]   - Oh, let me tell you, middle school is awful.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:56.960]   - But we talked earlier about how some people
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   feel like asking questions looks bad.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.360]   I think another one is not knowing the answer.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.680]   But here, multiple times your answer has been,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.320]   "Well, I don't know enough about that to answer."
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.160]   And I think so many people-
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.480]   - Do you respect people more
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.760]   who admit what they don't know?
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.080]   - I do, but I think people are always afraid
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.240]   to not know the answer
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.400]   and they feel like they're gonna look bad.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.580]   - Again, makes no sense to me.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.040]   - I wonder if it comes-
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.520]   - Again, applying the golden rule,
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.960]   how would you like to be treated?
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.920]   You want someone to bullshit you?
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.480]   - No, no, so many things that you've said are so obvious,
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.640]   but I think oftentimes we worry,
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.400]   "Oh, how will people look at me?"
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.760]   And maybe this goes back to me being the millennial
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.040]   looking for my friend's advice,
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.840]   caring more about what they think than what matters.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.520]   But I wouldn't say I embody that,
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.040]   but if I don't know the answer,
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.760]   I guess my curiosity leads me to,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.120]   "Well, I don't know, but let's go find out."
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.280]   - Let's go find out, right.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.060]   - And I think one fortunate thing is if you don't know,
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.440]   it's a lot easier to find the answer.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.040]   I wonder if 20 years ago,
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.440]   you could get away with making up an answer a lot easier
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.900]   'cause it wasn't as easy to fact check.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.600]   I don't know.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.280]   - Yeah, but people also didn't make up answers
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.480]   the way they do today. (laughs)
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.160]   Because if you write well,
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.720]   you can publish something on the internet
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.200]   that people will believe.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.040]   - Yes.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.080]   - You don't have to be an expert.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.720]   - No, I think finding experts
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.840]   is probably a lot harder now than it has been.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.080]   I think you've mentioned, I wrote down a bunch of names,
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.780]   people you've worked with, people you looked up to
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.560]   that have all kind of been experts or mentors or partners.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.440]   How did you create those relationships and foster them?
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.400]   Because I think all of us, myself included,
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.920]   hope that one day when I'm having conversations like this
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.760]   on your side, that I have all those people to lean on
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.920]   and say, "Oh, this person who taught me all of this,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.280]   this person who taught me all of this."
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.520]   - Someone didn't necessarily teach me,
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.120]   I might have observed.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:50:00.480]   And using some of the lessons that I shared to filter,
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.840]   you might find some people in your life
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.400]   who are really, really good.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.480]   Boy, you ought to pay a lot of attention to them.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.080]   I'm 65 years old, and I've been on the board of directors
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.800]   of the University of Pennsylvania for 19 years now.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.600]   So I joined when I was 46.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:22.680]   I absolutely adore one of our former chairman,
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.960]   who was the vice chair of T. Rowe Price.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.320]   And I'm like a puppy dog in his case.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.800]   And I'm like a puppy dog in his company.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.320]   So even when I was 60 years old or 62 years old,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.160]   if I had an opportunity to sit next to him at a bar
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.680]   and just soak up his lessons,
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.920]   to this day I keep learning from him.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.800]   So when you find someone who's really good,
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.120]   boy, pay attention to them.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   - And have the people who've done that to you stood out
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.720]   by just asking good questions?
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.640]   - Yeah, absolutely, all it really takes.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.080]   And I have infinite time for people who do that.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.640]   - Be careful what you wish for.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.480]   We've got lots of people listening.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.800]   - I understand, but there have to be people I know.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   So I often get asked to engage with people on LinkedIn
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.600]   or things like that.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.040]   And I tell them, I'm sorry,
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.720]   but I only do this with people I know.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.840]   And I'm amazed by the number of people who don't understand
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.960]   you should always be introduced.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.080]   Never cold call anyone.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.280]   Like venture, one of the first lessons I learned
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.480]   as a venture capitalist is never engage
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.040]   with anyone who cold calls you.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.160]   Because imagine what they'll do
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.800]   when they're an entrepreneur.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.280]   If they cold call customers,
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.760]   they're never gonna get them to engage.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.120]   So it's sort of a test.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.320]   If you can't find someone who knows me,
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.520]   then you might not be creative enough
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.000]   or the appropriate person to start a company.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.560]   - But does that lesson apply to someone
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.080]   who doesn't necessarily want to start a company,
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.560]   but you think the same rule applies
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.000]   is always find the introduction?
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.840]   If you're gonna make an introduction for someone,
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.200]   first ask the person to whom you're making the introduction
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.800]   if they're open to it.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.640]   - Yes.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.440]   - 'Cause otherwise you're gonna annoy them.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.680]   And I'm amazed by the number of people who,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.480]   when someone says, will you introduce me to Chris?
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.360]   And I'll say, well, I'll just let me check.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.080]   But many people will just send a forward the email
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:29.920]   as an introduction.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.320]   Well, that's a pain in the ass for you.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.920]   If I were to, it's not treating you
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.880]   the way I would want to be treated.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.560]   So be conscious of these things.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.360]   But ask for an introduction.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.440]   Why should someone spend time with someone
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.600]   that they don't know?
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.400]   I don't understand.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.200]   - I think the one place I'll push back is
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.880]   if you are able to offer a ton of value to someone,
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.800]   I think you can overcome the cold call problem.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.040]   - Well, then you have to be well-known.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.480]   - Or someone at a company I worked at
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.720]   really loved the company,
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.320]   wanted to be involved in the company and said,
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.000]   they sent an email to a few people and said,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.360]   I just spent six hours going through your product.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.840]   And I have all of this feedback for you.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.960]   And you don't know me.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.280]   - But they spent a lot of time, okay, I respect that.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.440]   I agree with you on that.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.320]   - So I think if you're young and you have time on your hand,
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.080]   but you don't have your network yet,
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.760]   I think putting in the time and energy
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.240]   to add value to that person.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.800]   - Okay, completely agree.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.960]   We actually had an employee at our company
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.680]   who did that on Twitter.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.040]   That he kept defending the company against trolls
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.440]   over and over and over again.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.160]   His name is Tyler Hogue.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.160]   And I reached out to Tyler
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.080]   because I really appreciated what he did.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   And he said, I'd love to come to work for Wealthfront.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.760]   And it was clear that he had spent the time and effort.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.720]   He didn't ask, based on what he did, I went to him.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.000]   I had a sales background
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.240]   and we don't have a sales function.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:08.240]   So I said, if you're willing to start in product support,
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.800]   which is what we call customer service,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.400]   I'll make sure that you have a shot
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.840]   to move into another function, as we described earlier.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.520]   And he said, absolutely, which most people wouldn't say.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.640]   So he joined us and then within a year and a half,
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.760]   he moved into product.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.720]   He's from Utah and he was recruited by a startup in Utah
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.640]   that was willing to make him the VP of product.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.800]   That company I think was sold for over a billion dollars.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.560]   He did exceptionally well.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.160]   And now he's a Utah-based venture capitalist.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.600]   But he put the time and effort in.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.480]   - And was willing to take a role
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.520]   that some people might think was too small.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.560]   - But was beneath them.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.880]   - Yeah.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:56.080]   - And every step of the way, he put in the extra effort
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.400]   because he was so passionate.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.120]   - Do you think that the key to leveling up
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.320]   is just putting in the effort?
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.160]   We talk a lot about work-life balance.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.040]   - You have to have enough talent.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.800]   - Enough talent, but I think in this day and age,
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.680]   I constantly see people talking,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.440]   oh, today people just want more benefits,
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.240]   more work-life balance, all this stuff.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.320]   - I think work-life balance is really hard
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.920]   if you want to be really successful.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:30.240]   Again, really successful.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.400]   That doesn't mean that it's bad
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.080]   to not be really successful.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.440]   I'm not saying that.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.920]   But it's really hard to have a work-life balance
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.640]   if you want to be really successful.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.560]   You can get the leisure time after you're successful.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.480]   - You know, we talk about ways to be successful.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.320]   How much of it-
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.560]   - And by the way, success isn't money.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:56.560]   It's being absolutely, by excelling in whatever you do.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:03.200]   - How much of that is not just work, but luck?
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   - I think there's an article that I love sharing
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.600]   with my students in my product market fit class
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.240]   that's written by my investment idol,
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.400]   a guy named Howard Marks,
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.640]   who is a famous distressed debt investor
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.880]   from Oak Tree Capital.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   And he's equally as well-known for his quarterly letters
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.680]   to his investors.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.080]   And they're always very thought-provoking.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.280]   And he wrote this one letter called "You Bet"
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:41.040]   that talked about success in investing
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.040]   is very similar to certain types of gambling
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:53.560]   in that people confuse outcomes with good decisions.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.800]   That outcomes are a function of the quality
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.000]   of the decision process,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.800]   the extent to which you take maximum advantage
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.320]   of the data available to you,
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.240]   because there's hidden information, and luck.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.040]   Now, roulette is a pure game of luck,
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.600]   but poker is a function of the three.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.440]   Investing is a function of the three.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.280]   I think entrepreneurship is a function of the three.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   You can have a, if you really focus on your product process,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:30.400]   just like you really focus on your investment process,
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.720]   you won't always be successful,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.680]   but you really improve your probability of success.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.720]   And that's why at Wealthfront,
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.720]   we spend a lot of time, as you know,
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.760]   focused on our product process.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.960]   - Yeah, I think--
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.440]   - So this is true in one's career as well.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.000]   I think if you really focus on the process
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.960]   of becoming a learn-it-all,
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.400]   you take maximum advantage of the information
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.960]   that's available to you.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.200]   If there's a surprise, you savor it.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.960]   Odds are you're going to do well,
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.360]   but you can run into bad luck.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.680]   - Yeah.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.920]   So you talked about judging your decisions
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.080]   and ways to look at things in hindsight.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.320]   How do you make decisions?
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.720]   - What do you mean?
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.920]   - Do you have a process for making big decisions
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.440]   in life or work?
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.960]   - Well, there are decisions made under uncertainty
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.920]   and decisions made under certainty.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.120]   So under certainty means you have a lot of data.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.960]   Those are the easiest decisions,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.520]   and they actually are the least impactful
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.520]   'cause anybody can make those decisions.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.920]   The hardest decisions and the most impactful ones
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.000]   are the ones made under uncertainty.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.960]   So that comes down to judgment.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.240]   - Okay, so let's talk about judgment
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.720]   'cause I know when I first joined Wealthfront,
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.880]   it was something that you mentioned
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.840]   was like a very important characteristic,
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.680]   someone's judgment.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.720]   - To success.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.720]   - Yes.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:05.000]   And what does judgment mean?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.480]   How do you think about?
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.880]   - Well, judgment to me is decision-making under uncertainty,
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.040]   which means there's a bunch of luck involved,
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.880]   but some people show evidence
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.240]   of having better judgment than others.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.440]   - And is it just a feeling?
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.880]   Is it looking at how someone makes a decision sometime
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.880]   and there's no process, but it's a gut feeling?
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.040]   - This was another thing I spent a lot of time on
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.960]   in interviews.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.200]   Tell me about some decisions you made under uncertainty,
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.800]   the ones that worked and the ones that didn't.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.760]   And I wanted to know how they came to the conclusion.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.120]   And what was the quality of their thinking,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.000]   thinking through the logic of the challenge?
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.680]   To me, job choice was the best proxy for judgment.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.360]   - And just seeing what people have done
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.120]   in their career in the past, or?
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.840]   - What companies they chose
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.920]   and the success of those companies.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.600]   - And with enough data points,
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.240]   you can kind of get rid of the luck.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.440]   If they've had one job and one role and it was unsuccessful,
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.640]   you wouldn't fault them for that.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.280]   - I wouldn't fault them for that.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.920]   But if they had three straight really successful companies,
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.120]   they have taste.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.640]   Taste is another way of saying judgment.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.480]   - Okay.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.440]   - And they would tell me what characteristics
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.120]   they would look for.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.640]   - And seeing how they think through things.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.320]   So really it's in the same way
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.720]   that you would judge a decision
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.280]   based on the process you followed,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.400]   the information you used.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.640]   It's really judgment is just, how do you make decisions?
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.000]   - Well, some people think it's pattern matching.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.880]   There are a number of people who don't like pattern matching
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.720]   but it's a really, really important way to make a decision.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.760]   You just have to make sure
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.600]   that there aren't biases involved.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.880]   And you have to be very, very conscious
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   of not allowing biases into that process.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.680]   - And how would you do that?
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.400]   - Just by being conscious of it.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.640]   - Just calling them out in advance
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.040]   of whatever that process is.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:05.880]   - Yeah.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.760]   - Do you have an example?
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.840]   I'm trying to think through what that would look like.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.840]   - Well, there's confirmation bias.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.480]   We see what we're looking for.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.800]   There's desirability bias.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.400]   The bias toward the outcome that we want.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.840]   So just being conscious about these things
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.760]   keeps you honest and helps you make better decisions.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.040]   - Okay.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.080]   I feel like I wrote a lot of things down.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.560]   We got through almost all of them.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.840]   There's a couple random ones.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.200]   You talked about, David,
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.960]   at Wealthfront being a voracious reader.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.800]   Do you think reading is a skill
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.720]   or a trait of someone who's successful?
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.960]   Do you read a lot?
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.240]   How do you think about where reading--
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   - My wife would kid me
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.640]   that I never read anything without staples in it.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.360]   So until I effectively retired,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.160]   which is the stage I'm at,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.160]   I haven't had a ton of time to read fiction and nonfiction.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.560]   Most of my time was spent reading about business stuff,
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.920]   work-life balance that we talked about before.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.760]   I watch a lot of TV and movies,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.240]   so it's not like I'm a total dullard
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.720]   who only is focused on business.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   But I think if you wanna get better at what you do,
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   there's a lot of value in meeting the principles
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.240]   because everyone revises history in public forums.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.200]   You have to be careful that I'm not revising history here
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.080]   as I'm speaking to you.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.320]   But every successful company has revised history
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.080]   on how they actually got to success
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   because consumers or buyers prefer buying from companies
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.960]   who always intended to serve them.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.680]   So if they started with an inflection point in technology,
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.880]   develop a product,
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.800]   and then they iterated through a bunch of markets
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.840]   till they found one that was desperate for what they had.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.720]   When they tell the story on a podcast,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.920]   it's always, you know, I saw this problem
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.080]   and I developed this solution
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.520]   because that's what people prefer to hear.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.520]   So it's challenging to reach conclusions
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.280]   based on what you hear on podcasts
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   or what you read in blog posts,
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.240]   which is why I encourage my students
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.960]   to, wherever possible, meet the principles
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.280]   because people tend to be much more truthful
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.120]   when you talk to them in person
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.520]   than when they talk in a one-to-many environment.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.680]   - Do you think, you know,
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.080]   if you go back more historically--
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.680]   - I benefited unbelievably in my career
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.040]   by meeting a lot of really, really interesting people
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.440]   and getting an introduction
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.320]   to the people I wanted to talk to.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.200]   And with introductions,
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.160]   people are generally open to meeting.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.640]   I think you wanted to meet me
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.440]   and you went through Nick Shalek.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.280]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.600]   - So that's how we met.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.880]   - Yes, and I think people who've had experience
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.240]   love sharing that experience.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.440]   So when you approach someone,
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.040]   and I've often used the line of like,
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.560]   I just love to hear some of the wisdom
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.840]   you've picked up in your industry.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.880]   People are like, I would love,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.720]   I'd love to share some of my wisdom.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.240]   It's like a compliment, but offering them a chance to teach.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.720]   - And it's usually unfiltered.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.560]   - Yes.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.960]   One thing we didn't talk about,
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.640]   you teach at Stanford in the Graduate School of Business.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.160]   How do you think about graduate school
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.960]   as a stop in someone's career?
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.960]   - The job for which you hire a premier business school
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.640]   is number one, pivoting your career,
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.400]   number two, developing a network,
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.520]   and unfortunately a distant number three is education.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.080]   And I'm guilty of it too,
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.800]   when I went to Stanford GSB for my MBA.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.520]   I think, because let's say you were an accountant
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.840]   and you wanna work for a software startup in marketing.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.280]   No one's gonna interview you.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.880]   Based on that resume,
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.840]   one month into going to a great business school.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.760]   - You can change their perspective.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.880]   - You can get the meeting.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.760]   You're the same person, but it matters.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.320]   So I think the biggest reason
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.000]   to go to a premier business school
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.880]   and why it's worth the money
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.720]   is if you wanna pivot your career.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.640]   - And so what would you say
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.720]   about a non-premier business school?
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.960]   - It's hard to justify the cost
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.920]   because is it really gonna allow you to pivot your career?
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.840]   Then I think you're primarily going for the education.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.880]   And I'm not sure you're gonna be that much further ahead
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.200]   on a net present value basis relative to the cost.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.680]   And I know that's a controversial thing to say.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.280]   - No, I just wonder, there are a lot of graduate schools
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.720]   that publish all of their content online.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.400]   In today's day and age,
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.600]   I wonder if you're paying for the discipline
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.920]   around the education more than the actual content itself.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.480]   - We could speak for hours on this one.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.960]   One of my teaching partners, Bill Barnett,
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.080]   who's a professor at Stanford GSB,
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.880]   likes to say there's no use,
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   there's no benefit teaching dead knowledge.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.040]   There's a lot of benefit in teaching live knowledge.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.600]   And he defines dead knowledge
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.120]   as something that's already well-known and understood.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.480]   He said, you can read that.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.840]   Live knowledge is something that you're,
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.960]   it's still in the process of being discovered,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.760]   which means you can have
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.200]   really interesting conversations about that.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.520]   And so his point of view is that schools
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.240]   should focus class time on live knowledge.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.240]   And I think that's a really fascinating point of view.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.840]   - And you teach a class on product-market fit.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.800]   Is that class more about the fundamentals?
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.480]   Or, 'cause I imagine if someone went and listened
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.920]   to every episode you've done
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.960]   of every podcast about product-market fit
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.320]   and heard all the references to the case studies,
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.360]   they could get some of the knowledge.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.720]   - Yes, but I view myself
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.960]   as not having come up with any novel ideas.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.840]   So I credit Don Valentine with the concept.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.600]   I put the name to it.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.360]   So I coined the term product-market fit.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.720]   But I learned the concept from Don Valentine at Sequoia
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.720]   because as a venture capitalist,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.440]   I wanted to understand another great venture firm
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.960]   that did things very differently
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.040]   than we did it at Benchmark.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.720]   So as someone who likes to learn about these things,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.000]   I tried to learn as much as I could.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.400]   And I actually learned a lot more about it,
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.840]   teaching it to try to make things very simple,
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.280]   to be able to express the terms very simply.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.880]   And so I see myself as a system integrator
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.600]   among a variety of books,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.000]   each of which address a component of the challenges.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.400]   And one of the things I've found for my students
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.760]   is they might read a chapter of the book
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.440]   and not understand it at all
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   because the understanding of that topic
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.200]   might have evolved since the book was published.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.640]   And the fact that I know the authors
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.640]   and have talked to the authors about the topics,
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.720]   I actually know the latest thinking on it.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.640]   So I'll help them interpret it
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.280]   in a way that they weren't able to do themselves.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.760]   - Okay.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.280]   - That's my value added as a teacher.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.800]   And that's why I think it's live knowledge.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.200]   - But again, the number one and the number two,
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.640]   we're not the education and the knowledge
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.720]   as much as the network and the pivot.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.200]   - This is, for someone who's interested in education
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.560]   on this particular topic, it's valuable.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.760]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.000]   - But I think that for most people
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.800]   who attend good business schools,
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.800]   they're there for the pivot and the network,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.360]   both of which are incredibly valuable.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.920]   - Yeah, I'll share something
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.520]   that will directly go into the last question I have,
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.640]   which is around parenting.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.080]   But there's this product that recently launched,
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.720]   and it's an app on the iPad for teaching kids to read.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.480]   And it's this company called Mentava.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.160]   I think I got it right.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.000]   We've been using it for four days.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.920]   And they got launched into much earlier than they wanted to
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.520]   because someone got so upset that they were creating an app
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.640]   to help kids learn to read earlier.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   And they thought, oh, Silicon Valley's trying
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.080]   to create these tools to go work at these companies
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.040]   and build robotic humans that are gonna be tech workers
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.560]   at age eight.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.400]   And they were like--
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.760]   - Wasn't there research that shows the age
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.400]   at which you start reading doesn't matter?
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.360]   - I think there is.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.920]   - I thought there was scholarly research to that.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.920]   - So I was like, oh, let's try this app out.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.800]   You get seven days for free.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.080]   - By the way, I care a lot about peer-reviewed research,
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.480]   which unfortunately the world doesn't seem to care
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.960]   as much about anymore.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.520]   - No, actually, I got an introduction to someone
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.720]   who their expertise is how to review peer-reviewed research.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.000]   And so I was thinking about doing an episode
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.640]   just to help everyone understand
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.360]   how do you actually look at research.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.240]   So as a consumer in any field, how could you review that?
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.400]   But the interesting thing about this app was
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.960]   we use it for four days now.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.840]   And I was like, the progress that our daughter has made
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.040]   in four days is mind-blowing.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.720]   Like taking four-letter words
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.320]   and saying them after seeing them in days.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.080]   And the company has been critiqued heavily online
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.840]   for charging a lot for an app.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.400]   So they have an app that helps your kid learn how to read.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.160]   They charge $500 a month, which is, they say-
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.240]   - It's value-based pricing.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.320]   - And the most interesting thing was I both totally agree.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.640]   And someone's like, $500 is crazy.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.360]   He's like, you don't have to pay it.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.200]   - Right.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.120]   - If you don't wanna pay it,
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.560]   here's a book on Amazon that's $17.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.720]   That will teach basically the same lessons.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.520]   But you have to do the curriculum.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.480]   You have to curate it.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.640]   You have to come up with the exercises and do it all.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.480]   And it was just wild.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.440]   I don't know why I'm bringing it up,
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.200]   but it made me think of both education
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.040]   and paying for education.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.320]   - Well, this reminds me of information wants to be free.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.400]   You only pay for convenience.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.120]   It's a great example, isn't it?
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:42.960]   - Yeah.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.440]   - You could find the research
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.800]   that explains how to do all this.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.320]   But if you provide the convenience of delivering it,
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.960]   if you make it convenient to do this,
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.480]   that's really providing a lot of value.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.320]   - Yes.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.240]   We have three days left
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.840]   before we actually have to make a decision
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.320]   on whether we keep using this app.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.960]   And the data I've seen shows
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.000]   that it doesn't really matter what age you learn this.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   So why do we need to push it?
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.600]   - It makes you feel better as a parent.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.480]   - I know, I know.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.560]   And that was the last thing I wanted to ask you, right?
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.320]   We talked about a couple points about parenting,
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.880]   but I haven't met your children,
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.800]   but from what I've heard from you, they turned out great.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.240]   - Well, I really am crazy about them.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.600]   - Yes, and we all are.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.920]   - And I'm fortunate to have an amazing wife
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   who is the better parent of the two.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.680]   - But aside from encouraging
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.200]   and provoking intellectual curiosity,
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.560]   what other pieces of advice do you have for parents
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.320]   listening about taking some of your lessons
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.880]   going through that experience?
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.040]   - I think that would be arrogant of me
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.240]   to say that the way that I did this was the right way.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.760]   I recently, a year and a half ago, became a grandparent
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.320]   and every one of my friends
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.280]   who has recently become a grandparent
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.600]   has experienced the same thing,
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.440]   which is all of our kids tell us
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.200]   that the way that we brought our kids up was all wrong.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.600]   So I'm not sure I can answer that question well.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.240]   - Okay.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.920]   It's funny 'cause I have had that conversation
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.760]   with my parents.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.360]   Oh, come on, we gotta do these things these different ways.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   What were you doing?
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.240]   - You seem to have turned out pretty well.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.840]   - I know, so maybe it doesn't matter.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.360]   - I don't know, but clearly the research has changed
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.680]   since my kids were born.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.280]   It's very funny to my wife and me
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.800]   and to our friends as we hear this from our kids.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.640]   - I do think that some of what the research shows
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.320]   is just being around, like caring,
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.200]   being a parent that is interested
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.200]   in what your kids are doing.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.400]   It's not what book, what time did you start reading lessons?
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.440]   What layout was there room in?
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.480]   How did you paint the house?
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.520]   It's not these little things
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.680]   as much as it is just being there.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.360]   So I haven't gone deep on parenting.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.880]   I have an interview with someone
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.240]   who I think has thought about this far more
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.280]   than both of us, a woman named Emily Oster,
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.120]   who's written a bunch of books.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.800]   She's a professor at, I think, Brown.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.480]   And she wrote this pregnancy book
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.800]   followed by the early childhood book,
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.000]   followed by a book that we're now reading
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.040]   called "The Family Firm,"
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.160]   which is how to run a family in a productive way.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.840]   And the thing I love about her work
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.360]   is she's like, I'm gonna go read
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.880]   all the peer-reviewed research
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.720]   and then just break down what my interpretation of it is.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.560]   You do what you want.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.600]   - Well, I'm in awe of my wife
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.480]   because she practices unconditional love
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.840]   in a way that I can't get to.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.600]   And I think that's what made her an amazing mom.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   And I think that that really resulted in two great kids.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.080]   - That's amazing.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.200]   Well, I'm working on that.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.640]   There, I'm sure, will be days between now
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.000]   and teenage girl years, as you mentioned,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   where it's trying, but so far it's great.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.400]   The only other thing I'll ask
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.400]   is you try to be a very efficient user of time.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.640]   Are there things that that has led you to do differently
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.800]   that you think maybe most people aren't doing
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.920]   who are poor users of time?
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.120]   - I think one's greatest strength
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.840]   is usually one's greatest weakness.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.840]   And in order to be the most efficient of time,
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.320]   you might be perceived as being rude
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.200]   because you cut someone off or you stopped a meeting
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.000]   or you didn't give them as much time
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.920]   as they might have felt that they deserved.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.240]   - And so does that mean you still do that, or?
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.320]   - Yeah, if I wanna be jealous of my time,
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   I'm not gonna just keep going for the sake of continue,
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.880]   to make someone feel as good as they can possibly feel.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.200]   Like I wanna treat someone the way I'd like to be treated.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.880]   There's the golden rule and there's the platinum rule.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.440]   Treat someone the way they would like to be treated.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.440]   That's really hard to do, I think.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.840]   - Yeah, but I do think the time--
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.480]   - Therein lies the trade-off.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.640]   I think there's a time trade-off
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.240]   between the golden rule and the platinum rule.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.640]   - And how do you strike the balance?
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.000]   - I don't know if there is a right balance.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.680]   I think that's where one needs to use judgment.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.840]   - I do think when it comes to people's time,
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.360]   sometimes you think people will be offended
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.040]   in circumstances that they aren't.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.000]   And I think we've probably brought up a few examples
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   already about that, but if you're pitching a company
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.800]   and someone, investors, has decided after two minutes
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.720]   they're never gonna invest to let them pitch for an hour,
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.680]   is that as productive or not?
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.000]   - Well, I'm not gonna cut the meeting off.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.760]   There are a lot of really rude venture capitalists
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.640]   who have their assistants come in after 15 minutes
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.440]   with a fake phone call.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.000]   And they'll decide, based on the quality
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.320]   of the first 15 minutes,
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.080]   whether or not they wanna continue.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.920]   I would never do that.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.160]   But I might try to bring the meeting to an end
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.440]   after 30 minutes if it's not going anywhere,
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.600]   'cause I don't wanna waste their time
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.840]   and I don't wanna waste mine.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.440]   - I think a lot of people are afraid to do that.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.040]   - So how do you do that nicely?
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.040]   Now, you can make an enormous effort to be nice about it,
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.480]   and some people will feel badly
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.120]   because they didn't get an hour,
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.120]   no matter how nicely you delivered the message.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.360]   So it depends.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.720]   - My hack there is that you just schedule the meeting
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.880]   for a very short and then block extra time,
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.200]   so they don't have the expectation that they had an hour.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.640]   - Yeah, but how would you feel if somebody said
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   you only have half an hour?
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.760]   You feel a little rushed.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.600]   - I guess in the fundraising example, maybe that is true.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.880]   In just generally a life phone call, a meeting,
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.520]   I don't know if everything has to be an hour.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.240]   - I would agree with you.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.760]   And that's why I don't use invite apps.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.160]   I don't want to set an expectation
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.080]   around how long the meeting is going to be.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:22.080]   But for my students, I mean, I always set aside an hour
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.520]   because that's for them.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.720]   That's not for me.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.120]   - Okay.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.440]   - And after 30 minutes, they'll say,
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.760]   do we have any more time?
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.080]   And I'll say, I have all the time you want.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.800]   - So I intentionally didn't bring up negotiating
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.640]   in the conversation because we talked about it last time
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.600]   when we talked about investing.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.720]   So if anyone wants to hear your stance there,
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.520]   I'll say, go back and listen to that episode.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.280]   I'll link it in the show notes.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.960]   But one thing I realized in that investing conversation
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.640]   that we didn't really cover,
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.960]   that I'll ask you about as a departure,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.360]   which we started the conversation with,
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.320]   is about being non-consensus
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.320]   and how important that is in investing.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.880]   Can you talk a little bit about why
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.840]   that is one of the ways the most successful investors invest?
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.680]   - Sure.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.840]   Well, I credit Howard Marks, who I referenced earlier.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.840]   Almost all of his letters are premised on his belief
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:20.040]   that investing can be described with a two-by-two matrix.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.680]   And I believe that this matrix is equally applicable
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.960]   to entrepreneurship as it is investing.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.880]   On one dimension, you can be right or wrong.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   And on the other dimension,
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.720]   you can be consensus or non-consensus.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.320]   Now, obviously, if you're wrong, you don't make money.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.800]   But what most people don't realize
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.040]   is if you're right in consensus,
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.040]   you don't earn outsized returns
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.920]   because they get arbitraged away.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.600]   It's too obvious.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.560]   The only way that you earn above market returns
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:51.560]   or outsized returns are by being right and non-consensus.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   The challenge is you know you're non-consensus,
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.440]   you don't know if you're right.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.280]   - Yes.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.360]   - So you have to have, I think,
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.280]   tremendous command of your subject
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.280]   to be able to take the leap of faith
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.400]   to make that kind of bet.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   But in this world, you don't earn outsized,
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.880]   and the reason you earn outsized returns in that quadrant
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.920]   is because risk is correlated with return.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.440]   So you're taking more risk.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.040]   Therefore, you should generally be compensated
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.000]   with more return.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.720]   Should be, not always the case.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.880]   There's always outliers to everything
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   that I've said on this entire podcast.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:38.720]   So I think about this a lot in venture capital.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.260]   I think some firms outperform others consistently.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.400]   There's about 20 firms whose returns,
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.520]   whose realized returns, not unrealized returns.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.240]   That's a big difference, are consistently in the top 20.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.400]   And that's because they know which leaps of faith to take
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.120]   on which to be non-consensus.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.080]   And I think that's the intellectual property
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.680]   that the premier firms have.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:09.240]   So Bill Gurley turned me on to this framework
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.880]   soon after he joined Benchmark.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.880]   So this might have been in around 2000, 2001.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.740]   And then I had the unbelievably good fortune
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.880]   to serve on the Penn Board of Trustees with Howard Marks.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.420]   So one day, my first trustee meeting,
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:27.580]   the university secretary came over to me
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.160]   to introduce me to this fellow named Howard Marks.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.200]   And I said, "The investor?"
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.880]   And he said, "Yes."
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.920]   So as you might imagine, I spent a lot of time
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.240]   asking Howard Marks questions about this.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.600]   - For anyone listening,
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.520]   all of these memos are available to anyone.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.400]   So I'll link to them in the show notes, but-
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.520]   - They're unbelievable.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.320]   - Yes, I've read many of them.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.880]   And to the point about Bill Gurley,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.960]   Bill Gurley now has his own podcast.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.160]   And so anyone that wants to go listen to his wisdom,
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.720]   he does that every two weeks.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.680]   So I think one great thing is that a lot of the knowledge
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.240]   that you've talked about,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.480]   people are now sharing even more than they were before.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.980]   Howard Marks has been writing for a while,
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.280]   but I think Bill Gurley is just a few months
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.400]   into a podcast.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.200]   I don't know when your show's coming,
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.920]   but this will have to do for now.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.120]   - Okay, good.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.040]   - Andy, is there anything I didn't cover?
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:19.880]   My goal was to-
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.160]   - I'm not sure, maybe we'll have another episode.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.000]   - I love it.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.440]   Andy, thanks for joining me.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.440]   - Always a pleasure.
