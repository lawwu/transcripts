[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So now let's talk about what I'm calling critical period
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.180]   three of each 24 hour cycle.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.040]   So this would be the period of time of late evening.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.600]   So it might be 6 p.m. for some,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.640]   depending on when you go to sleep or 7 p.m.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   extending into the hours in which you decide to get into bed
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.440]   and go to sleep.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.920]   And then throughout the night,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800]   there are a number of things that you're going to want to do.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.320]   And there are a number of things that you are going to want
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.280]   to avoid doing in order to optimize your sleep.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.160]   First of all,
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.860]   you're going to want to avoid bright artificial lights of
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.120]   any color.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.100]   Yes, of any color.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.000]   We haven't talked a lot about blue blockers, you know,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.200]   lenses that block blue wavelengths or short wavelengths of
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.240]   light.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.920]   I don't have anything against blue blockers.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.760]   In fact,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120]   many people find that blue blockers provide them some relief
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.080]   from headache and some eye strain if they wear blue blockers
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.480]   throughout the day and certainly at night,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.960]   but you don't need them.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.100]   And even if you do wear them,
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.440]   you will find that if lights are very bright,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.600]   it doesn't matter if it's a blue light,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   a yellow light, or a red light,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.720]   those bright lights will wake up your brain and body.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.880]   They will activate the same mechanisms that were activated
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.540]   early in the day by sunlight.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560]   However, and here's the really diabolical twist.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.400]   I mentioned this earlier,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400]   but the diabolical twist in the way that your brain and body
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.280]   respond to light is that early in the day,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.120]   in the morning hours,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.360]   you need a lot of bright light ideally from sunlight to be
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.600]   very alert and to wake up.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.000]   But in the evening hours and nighttime hours,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.320]   it takes very little light,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.320]   very few photons in order to wake up your brain and body and
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.420]   to disrupt your circadian clock and disrupt your sleep.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.500]   So what that means is that once the sun goes down,
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.320]   which of course is going to happen at different times of
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960]   year in different places on earth,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.640]   but once the sun goes down,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.960]   you would be wise to try and dim the lights in your indoor
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.520]   environment most days, right?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.000]   I realized some nights you're going to throw a party and
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   have people over, you might not want to dim the lights.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.360]   Some nights you're going to go out.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.600]   You might view a lot of bright lights,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   but most nights of your life,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280]   you're going to want to dim the lights in your internal
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.480]   environment.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.640]   And ideally the lights that you do use,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.860]   you would place low in that physical environment.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.060]   So you would try and not use overhead lights,
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.560]   but rather rely on desk lamps or lights,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.060]   even place low to the floor, even on the floor.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.960]   If you are going to use light at night, and most people do,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.760]   I would encourage you to use as little artificial light as
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.800]   is required to carry out the activities you need to require
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.860]   safely.
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.520]   That could be studying in which case you might need a
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.080]   little bit more light in order to read or study.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.160]   If you're watching a television show,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.960]   or you're watching something on your computer,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   dim that screen way, way down as dim as possible.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.840]   While still, of course,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.880]   being able to view what you need to view even better.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.840]   I should say, ideally,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.160]   you would use candle light and or moonlight.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.440]   Now some nights the moon is really bright and you actually
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.400]   can use moonlight to go about your usual activities.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.960]   Moonlight might seem very, very bright,
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.800]   but actually moonlight is fairly low light intensity.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.420]   And candle light, which can also seem very bright,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.880]   actually is very low light intensity.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.920]   If you're sitting across the table with some candle light
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.760]   there, and it's a really bright candle,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.980]   chances are it's only about three to 10 lux,
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.680]   which is very, very little light energy compared to say an
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.560]   artificial desk lamp or an overhead light,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.800]   which is going to be in the area of anywhere from a hundred
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.680]   to a thousand lux.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.280]   So candle light is fine, of course,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.200]   be cautious with open flame, but candle light is fine.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.240]   Moonlight is fine.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   Dimming artificial lights is fine,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.280]   provided they're dimmed way, way down.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.560]   And again,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.420]   try and avoid using overhead artificial lights.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.560]   The absolute worst lights are going to be overhead
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.920]   fluorescent lights of the sort that you would have in the
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.600]   supermarket or that you would see at a gas station or
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.720]   something of that sort.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.120]   And I confess there are times in which I'm, you know,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240]   driving home and it's late at night and I want to be able to
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.920]   get to sleep and I'll need to stop at the grocery store or a
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.120]   gas station or something like that.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.200]   I've actually put on sunglasses at night in order to avoid
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.120]   getting that bright light exposure at night.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.840]   Although that's a little bit extreme.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.240]   I have done that from time to time because that bright light
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.400]   exposure will absolutely quash.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.960]   It will eliminate any melatonin that happens to be
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.400]   circulating in your brain and body.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.600]   Now, melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.080]   but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.760]   about and into the nighttime hours,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.680]   it's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.520]   fall asleep.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.400]   So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.520]   nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.040]   and your ability to fall and stay asleep.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.360]   So for most people,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.880]   a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.120]   artificial lights of all colors.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.520]   And in particular overhead bright artificial lights between
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.680]   the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.960]   That's right between 10 PM and 4 AM avoid those bright
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.320]   artificial lights as much as possible.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.360]   Use only as much light as is absolutely necessary in order to
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.140]   carry out the routines and activities you need to carry out
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.980]   safely.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.840]   I should mention that the reason overhead lights are
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680]   problematic is the same reason why sunlight is so great
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.640]   early in the day, which is that the cells,
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.520]   that is the neurons that can wake up your brain and body
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.560]   through activation of the circadian clock reside mainly in
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.240]   the bottom half or two thirds of your neural retina.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.440]   And the way the optics of your eyes work is that the cells on
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.000]   the bottom half of your eye view the upper visual field.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.760]   So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism that allows these
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.360]   cells to respond to overhead light from sunlight in the
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.200]   early part of the day and throughout the day.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.320]   But in the evening,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.640]   if you have bright artificial lights on and those bright
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.320]   artificial lights are overhead lights,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.780]   it's going to more closely mimic what sunlight does in the
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.620]   evening time.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.420]   And that turns out to be a bad thing if your goal is to
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.680]   eventually go to sleep.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.240]   So again, do like the Scandinavians do use lights that are
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   set low in the room at night.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.160]   And if you really want to optimize your sleep-wake cycles,
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.520]   I suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.920]   You could really emphasize the use of bright artificial
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.020]   lights and sunlight that comes from above.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.920]   And of course, sunlight always comes from above,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.120]   but if you're working in a given, you know,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.020]   office environment and you know,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.520]   it's 2:00 PM or 3:00 PM and you want to be as awake as
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.580]   possible, really crank up the overhead lights.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.860]   And then in the evening is,
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.160]   which is this critical period three that we're referring to
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.140]   really try and dim those lights or have them off,
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.500]   or just rely on candlelight or moonlight from the hours of
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.320]   about 10:00 PM until 4:00 AM.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.580]   Our good friend Samer Hattar,
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.120]   who's been on this podcast before.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.660]   Samer is director of the chronobiology unit at the national
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.260]   institutes of mental health.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.100]   Well,
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.300]   he's absolutely obsessive about this light stuff and
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.140]   avoiding light at night.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.500]   In fact, he lives in what I joke is like a cave at night
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.420]   from 9:00 PM until 5:00 AM,
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.420]   which is really his kind of sleep cycle.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.460]   He has his house so dark that you'd be lucky to be able to
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.980]   find a spoon in the kitchen.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.900]   In fact, you'd be lucky to find your way down the hallway if
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.700]   you're me, but in any case,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.660]   dim the lights from them way, way down.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.580]   It will serve you well.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.620]   It will make it much easier for you to get sleepy and stay
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.620]   sleepy and fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.460]   (upbeat music)
