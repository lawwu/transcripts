[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   David Goggins posted a 48 hour challenge which is run four miles every four hours,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   totaling up to 48 miles. That's 12 sessions. I'm doing it to harden up the mind in a dimension
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.920]   that I don't usually challenge myself. It's cold outside, below freezing, it's icy and wet,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.000]   it's windy. I actually tried to record this intro outside, I had to come back in because it was too
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.560]   windy for the audio or I don't know what I'm doing. In general, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.040]   I didn't try to think about this too much, just said do it. I said I was going to do it,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.560]   I'm going to do it. You might be wondering, I'm wondering how long I'm actually going to last.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.040]   You're going to have to watch the end to find out. I might swap out a jiu jitsu training session for
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.840]   one of the running sessions. I also decided to do an exercise of gratitude, almost like a thought
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.240]   experiment. I wrote down 12 things I'm grateful for, one for each session to think about when I
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.120]   run and to talk about when I come back from the run. I thought this would be a nice challenge,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.480]   a nice way to strip away all the literal and metaphorical fat from the mind, all the distractions,
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.560]   all the busyness that fills up the day, to really purely zoom in on the things that make life
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.920]   worthwhile. To be thankful for them and to push the mind to its limits to see that I still got it.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.160]   Still a tough guy in a way that I don't usually these days test myself. I usually test myself in
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.960]   the realm of intellectual work. I don't as much test myself in the realm of physical work.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.240]   So let's see if I still got it. Cold, wet, windy, in the night, still rushing, still tough. Let's
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.800]   see. Let's see how long I last. Watch to the end to find out. All right, let's go.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:03.200]   All right, four miles down, 40 to go, plus a jiu-jitsu session. That was easy, but I can
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.600]   tell it's going to get tough. So like I said, I made a list of 12 things that I'm grateful for,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.560]   one per session. The first thing I'd like to show my gratitude for is to go all the way back to the
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:24.160]   beginning, is to my childhood, to my family in Russia, and to my grandmother, who was a really
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.520]   big, important person in my life, early in my life and throughout my life and throughout my memories.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:41.120]   The love, the kindness, the toughness, and also just the piercing, simple, minimalist intelligence
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.280]   that she gifted me or showed me the importance of. But of course, the love, just the care.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.800]   And I miss her deeply. I miss the bigger family very much. So many of my formidable experiences
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.920]   were there. So much of the soul of my love of literature, of my love of knowledge, of my love of
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.200]   pushing your mind to the limit, of understanding and curiosity about the human mind, so much of
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   it was born there. Whether it's in the early days of friendship with my close friend Yura,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:31.600]   who showed me the deep value of friendship. I think I understood what it means, the brotherhood
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   that makes in the companionship that with which life becomes somehow more fulfilling when you get
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.160]   to share it with somebody else. That kind of love, that kind of friendship was revealed to me early
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.440]   on as profoundly important and fulfilling in life. So, and the Russian culture, at least at that time,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.840]   at least in the context of my family. We didn't have many material possessions, but that didn't
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.440]   matter. It was all about the relationship, about the friendships, the music, the soul of the people
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.840]   that I loved. And it implanted in me, again, the love, the brotherhood, the connection with other
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.720]   human beings that's so profoundly fulfilling in life. All right, I'll try to talk less,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.520]   try to run more. I'm going to have to try to figure out the whole clothing in the shower
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.000]   situation. That's something I didn't anticipate with 12 sessions. I guess for most of them,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.400]   I'm going to have to jump in the shower and change clothes. So I'm going to maybe have to
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:41.840]   do a little bit of laundry. Okay. 11 to go. Let's do this. All right. That was 3 a.m. 8 miles down,
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.560]   36 miles to go, and one jiu-jitsu grappling session. That was a little bit wet,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   a little bit cold, but we'll be all right. The body feels good. The mind feels good.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   We'll do all right. This is kind of fun. Like I said, I'm making a list of things I'm grateful
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.080]   for. The second thing is, of course, my family, my dad, my mom, my brother. It's been ups and
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.920]   downs and tension like all families have, but really to focus in on the most important thing
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.000]   is there's been a lot of gifts that they've given me each. My dad's really given me nothing. No,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.840]   I'm just kidding. My dad's given me the love of knowledge of physics and science,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.320]   especially the rigorous mathematics, and also the love of music and poetry and wit of
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:41.280]   revealing, of seeing the absurdity and things that otherwise might seem painful, that might
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.000]   be stressful. Seeing the humor in all of it, that's a little bit of the Jew, a little bit of
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.720]   the Russian in him. My mom has taught me what it means to love, of course, but also what it means
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:06.880]   to express emotion. I mean, she's a vibrant, beautiful personality and human being, and
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.200]   I certainly have inherited a little bit of that in terms of temper, in terms of emotion, in terms
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:21.520]   of deeply feeling, experiencing things. I mean, I wish, I hope I inherited something from my brother
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.600]   because he's an incredible human being. He's fun. He's fascinating. He's brilliant. He's in many
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   ways opposite than me in terms of how much rich, interesting personality he has. I've always looked
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.120]   up to him growing up. I always wanted to be like him. I still want to be like him. So I'm really
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.960]   grateful for the family I have and for the tough times and for the beautiful times. So, all right,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.000]   here we go. Let's try to get some sleep. Let's get in the shower. We're almost there. Only 10 more
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:07.120]   sessions to go. Let's do this. See you at 7 a.m. Okay, that was 12 miles down. A lot more to go.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.360]   Feeling good. It's been a while since I've been up at 7 a.m. in the morning on a Saturday, but it
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.840]   feels good. It feels like I'm getting in front of the day because nobody else is out. This feels
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.040]   productive. I'm looking forward to hopping in the shower and getting some work done before the 11 a.m.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.400]   run and then the jiu-jitsu session. So, some people are asking me what I'm eating. I didn't
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.520]   plan any of this, so I'm eating what I usually eat, which is meat. I mostly eat meat these days.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.320]   And we all make mistakes, and one of mine is to eat like I usually do, which is one larger meal.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.520]   I eat after the 3 a.m. run, and that turned out not to be a good idea because I just feel
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.240]   just really heavy and full, which is not a good feeling when you're running. Okay, so in terms of
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.080]   things I'm grateful for is, you know, I often joke around about being Russian, and it's true.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.800]   The culture, the music, the poetry, the science of the people is in there in my blood and my roots
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:06.560]   and my family. But I am, at this point, I'm a red-blooded American. I love this country. This
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.480]   country has given me everything I have. The opportunities, the ability to do what I do,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.320]   the ability to challenge myself to create things I want to create. It's an incredible country,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.600]   an incredible country that welcomes immigrants with open arms, for the most part. People like
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:30.640]   me, silly Russian kids like me, with a dream. It opens its arms and puts it into this giant pool
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.560]   of people that compete against each other, cooperate against each other. There's a tension,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.240]   there's a love, and you figure out how to make it all work as a big pool of diverse
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:50.080]   kind of backgrounds. You know, nobody is truly from America except Native Americans, but even
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.800]   then there's a diversity in that history. So it's an incredible country in its welcoming of
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.560]   immigrants and opportunities it provides for people with a dream and that are willing to work
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:07.440]   hard. So I'm deeply thankful for this country, for the United States of America. I know I often
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.360]   joke around about being Russian, but it's more just wit and humor. And I am, in terms of my roots,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   Russian. But if we look, I look in the mirror, if we look at who I truly am, I'm an American.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.960]   I always will be American. And I love this country and the opportunities it's given me.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:36.160]   I'm deeply grateful for it. All right, that was 16 miles, four sessions, eight more to go.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.720]   I'm getting in a little bit of a zone, feeling good, getting a lot done. There's an interesting
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   urgency to everything, which I kind of enjoy. I'm actually getting a lot of work done. Even the
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.920]   napping has an urgency to it. I shut off, turn back on, have a lot of energy. The only thing
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.360]   I screwed up in is eating a little too much at 3 a.m. last night. But other than that,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.760]   I'm feeling pretty good. Still a little bit fat, still a little bit soft, but just
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.600]   getting out there on the road. It's a little cold, it's a little windy, but yeah, it feels good.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.440]   It's good. I'm glad I did it. It's a fun way to throw a wrench into the whole thing of life,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.720]   to make you appreciate everything and to be grateful for everything. So what is this,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   number four on the list of things I'm grateful for? Man, it's friendship in general. Like I said
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:32.560]   in Russia is when I first developed really close friendships. But really when I became,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.920]   it's silly to say, but when I became a man, I was in America, going to middle school and high
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.440]   school here, college, and meeting some really, really close friends, especially in the Chicago
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:53.680]   suburbs in Naperville, a really close friend of mine, Matt. I really formed a close lifelong bond
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   with him and with other folks here, with his family. And we don't often, these days we don't
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.640]   even often talk that much together, but there's still, anytime we see each other, it's like we
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:13.200]   never spent an hour away. So Matt and others have taught me the value of friendship. I spent so much
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.000]   time working, I spent so much time pursuing my passions, but behind it all is sort of a love for
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.600]   other human beings and friendship is at the core of that. Of course, I also want a family and
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:35.120]   friendship with a girl, with a wife, with my kids. But I see it all as kind of part of the
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   same big picture. And it all started in middle school, meeting that weird looking Iranian kid
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.920]   Matt, that we just instantly connected. Different worlds, different backgrounds,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.040]   different histories, different music preferences. The guy likes Biohazard and Pantera,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.320]   heavy metal. I like it. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. But I'm more of a classic rock kind
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:10.880]   of guy. And we together fell in love with music, playing guitar, sports, football, soccer, tennis,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.120]   chess, everything. Talking about the biggest philosophical questions about the universe and
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.360]   things like that. And it's always a pleasure to see him. And I'm deeply grateful for having the
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:31.600]   chance to met him, to met others in Naperville, Allen P., Jim, Jota, you know, countless people
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.960]   that have changed the direction of my life, have affected me, have shown me what friendship is all
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.240]   about. So I'm deeply grateful for that. Never forget it. They're always family. All right,
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.000]   let's go do some Jiu Jitsu.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:57.520]   This is John Fisher, black belt, instructor, philosopher, warrior. So we're going to train
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.040]   around a little bit.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.560]   Come on, come on.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:18.080]   So,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:27.600]   so,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:41.120]   so,
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:52.720]   all right, I think that's five sessions now, although I'm starting to lose track a little bit.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.120]   It was a fun time. That's a little break from the running. And it felt remarkably good for some
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.680]   reason. Makes me feel like this is the calm before the storm. But so 16 miles of Jiu Jitsu session,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:12.720]   just a few more miles to go. It should be fun. So, you know, since I did Jiu Jitsu, did a little
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.520]   bit of no-gi grappling, it's a good time to say that I'm grateful for all the people that I met
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.760]   on the mat. I forgot who said it, but it's true that the mat is one of the only places in this
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:32.320]   world that's deeply honest. You can't hide from the truth in combat sports in general. It's one
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.400]   on one, and it's just you and the opponent. And you're constantly, especially in the grappling
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:44.160]   sports, where you can go 100% and get choked and threatened of murder over and over and over again
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.880]   with some of your closest friends. I mean, it's an incredible kind of experience that's
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.320]   deeply humbling that I hope to be doing for the rest of my life. I see it extremely valuable for
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:00.960]   your intellectual curiosity and growth to be humble throughout your, no matter what you achieve
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:09.600]   in life. To be humble is, to me, is essential for happiness and for just continuous growth. But
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.040]   your brain can get lazy. You can start getting full of yourself. So I think Jiu Jitsu, for me at
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.960]   least, especially as my body gets softer and older and don't have as much time to train, Jiu Jitsu is
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   a great place to be humbled, where you can train with a young blue belt that'll kick your butt and
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.840]   submit you over and over. And it kind of reminds you that you might be good at programming or
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.280]   something like that, or you might be good in the space of science and so on. But somehow being
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:47.600]   tapped by a 20-year-old reminds you, one, that you're mortal, and two, that you're not as special
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.000]   as you think. You're not such a big shot. And I think that's a really powerful thing. I think
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.080]   that's probably an essential element of why I know I talk about looking up to Joe maybe a little too
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:05.040]   much, but I do in this regard, that he is truly everything he's accomplished in terms of both
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.520]   wealth and success and comedy and so on. He's still humble. I think Jiu Jitsu is a crucial part
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.600]   of that. It is for me. So I'm really grateful for having discovered, for having sort of come across
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.000]   this sport first through Judo. I'm grateful to the folks at Philadelphia Judo for revealing to me the
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.240]   beauty of this art, of the gentle art of Judo. And I'm really grateful to Balance Studios in
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.400]   Philadelphia for teaching me Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, taking me from white belt to black belt. I'm
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   really grateful for all the people I've met in the grappling arts and Jiu Jitsu and martial arts in
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.440]   general. I'm grateful for my current gym, Sean Fisher, John Clark, and all the people that train
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:55.760]   there. There's something about them that's both deeply philosophical. I think something about
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   Jiu Jitsu attracts or encourages the development of intellectual kind of chess-like puzzle-solving
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.280]   curiosity that creates really interesting people from all different kinds of backgrounds. And
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:17.440]   also the toughness, like I said, being tapped kind of sharpens your mind to understand
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:27.600]   that you're not special. And because you're not special, your approach to life has this kind of
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.720]   humble curiosity, which makes you a really interesting person to talk with, to be friends
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.000]   with, to just have a deep conversation with, to have some beers with. So from Broadway Jiu Jitsu
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.560]   here in Boston to all the way back to Philadelphia with Balance Studios and all the people I've gotten
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:51.520]   to meet, I'm deeply grateful for them. I hope I've been for the most part injury-free my whole life
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.600]   in martial arts. You know, banged up here and there, but nothing broken, nothing torn. I hope,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.560]   I really hope that stays the same. You know, if it doesn't, so what? I'll still persevere,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.520]   but I do hope to be doing Jiu Jitsu for the rest of my life. It's beautiful. It's a humbling journey
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:20.720]   I'm deeply grateful for. All right, I think that was 20 miles, but I'm not sure. I'm kind of losing
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:27.200]   track and also not really worrying about the full span of it, but instead focusing on the next step.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   It's getting a little bit tough. After doing Jiu Jitsu, your body gets banged up a little bit,
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.080]   so you get to feel the run a little bit, but not even just physically, you get to feel the duration
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.360]   of it mentally, which kind of starts wearing on you. You start to, the sleep, kind of the whole
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.200]   weight of it, because I've also been working while doing this in the span, in the ties between the
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.760]   runs. This is tough. There's the ups and downs, and I've been feeling pretty good, but I'm down
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.640]   pretty hard at this point. And, you know, I took a shower before filming this, just really doing
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.440]   what I would say filming is probably the hardest part, having to face the camera, having to reveal
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.880]   these parts of myself. Hopefully it's a value to somebody to be fragile in this way. I knew this
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.800]   was going to get tough. It might get even a lot tougher. I'm ready for it, whatever brings. So
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.320]   far so good physically. So there's a little bit of shin splints, a little bit of ankle pain.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:30.080]   I'm trying to make sure I keep a slow pace. I'm doing nine minute miles kind of pace to really
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.560]   make sure that no injuries get aggravated. I mean, we're starting to go into a territory I
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.480]   haven't been before in terms of distance, in terms of mind. So let's see. This is going to be fun.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:48.800]   It's a fun test. It might be kind of silly to say, but I'm really grateful for books,
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.760]   for having the opportunity from an early age to explore the minds and the thinking and the
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:02.960]   ideas of others through Camus, Hesse. So I would say most of the 20th century existential
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.520]   philosophers and writers were for me early on really influential. For me, at least,
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:16.960]   they broke me out of the pursuits of everyday life that we're born with, the sort of the focusing,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   the egotistical view of life where you just kind of focus on the task at hand.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.280]   And the existential way of thought, counterintuitively perhaps, got me to think
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.720]   about the bigger picture of life, got me to think about my own mortality, about
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   the meaning of life, of life in general. So Camus, Albert Camus, Herman Hesse, Nietzsche,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.800]   of course, Friedrich Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Franz Kafka, hugely influential for me.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.320]   Hemingway, George Orwell, Animal Farm is one of my favorite books. I don't know why,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:57.680]   just love it. For me, I would spend months, I read slowly and I'll spend months on a particular
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.880]   book and really take it in. It was kind of a friendship with both the author and the ideas
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:11.280]   in that. I mean, with Herman Hesse, Glass-Bean Game, Siddhartha, Damien, Steppenwolf, like all
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:18.320]   of these books, I guess I could say I dated them. I was like a girlfriend for a few months,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.760]   you know, and some of them I'm still seeing on the side every once in a while.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:31.280]   And I remember moments when there's reading these individual books and just coming to a point in
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.560]   the book where it was like a transformative moment. I would sit back and think about
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.880]   how incredible it is to be here, to be in my skin, to be alive, and also how terrifying it
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   is that this whole thing ends, just mortality. Speaking of which, Ernest Becker would denounce
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   death. So the more modern philosophers and thinkers and psychologists, nonfiction and fiction,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.400]   it's just a tremendous effect on me. If I were to regret anything, I think it has to do with
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:08.960]   my Soviet upbringing is I never really got into science fiction. So I've really, it seemed like,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.560]   to my mind, it seemed to me more profound and more important to study World War I and World War II
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:25.840]   and the subtle experiences of everyday life that Camus and Hasan Dostoevsky described,
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.440]   as opposed to having to create a fantasy world. I always thought the fantasy world is a
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:39.680]   kind of unneeded spice added to the picture that's already fascinating, and not fairly so,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.040]   I felt this way, because I can see now there's a lot of profound philosophical and dramatic work
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.240]   that's done in science fiction. But one of the things, one of my goals is to find the time to
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   read more science fiction. So if there's good recommendations, certainly the Foundation series,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:06.000]   I need to read Snow Crash, Dune, all of these books I need to read that have not been part of
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.400]   my childhood, but really should be part of my extended childhood because I still haven't grown
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.800]   up. Okay, talked for way too long, but it feels good to talk, maybe to escape from the running.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:27.200]   I look forward to the challenge of the 11pm run, or the 3am run, and I think it'll be the hardest
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.960]   is waking up for the 7am and doing that run, and then a full day after that. This is fun,
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.160]   I'm glad I'm doing it, it's a good test of mind. Let's go.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:50.320]   All right, 24 miles done, just past the halfway point, 11pm run. I'm feeling okay,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:24:00.640]   dreading going through the night a little bit, but injury-wise, a little bit of shin splints,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:07.120]   a little bit of aches here and there, hamstring from jiu-jitsu is a little bit roughed up,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.160]   but I'm going to be all right. It's just mental at this point, which is great. This is exactly
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:18.960]   what I wanted, a test of mind versus a test of aches and pains and injuries and stuff like that.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:27.200]   Something I'm grateful for, might be ridiculous to say, but because of my love for artificial
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.000]   intelligence, I'm grateful for the big community, the shoulders of giants that get to stand on
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.320]   from the 50s to the 60s to 70s and 80s, the development of different branches of computer
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.280]   science in general, mathematics, and all those things that are interconnected, neuroscience,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:51.920]   physics, to neurobiology, to psychology, of course, all those things are interconnected.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.000]   In my work, in my view of artificial intelligence, I'm deeply grateful for all those
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.440]   brilliant researchers, just allowing, and of course, computer programming, just
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   I believe, and robotics being able to build that stuff. I mean, there's just been, I guess it
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.600]   always feels like that when you're at the cutting edge that you're born just at the right time,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.200]   but for me, it really does feel like I've been born just at the right time to do truly big
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.240]   breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence. And initially when the dream
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.920]   was born for me, which is to understand the mind, I'm just, I feel like the kind of developments
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:38.880]   that are happening now, the kind of tools that are available for breakthroughs, both in the
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.000]   understanding and the engineering space is just amazing. I'm really grateful for that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.320]   Dreading a little bit, not looking forward to the night running, but it is what it is.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.000]   Gotta get it done. Let's go.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:05.360]   All right. I don't really feel like recording this video, but gotta do what you gotta do.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:17.280]   I just ran a 3 a.m. run. I think that's 28 miles. Then I spent maybe an hour at a Dunkin' Donuts
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.520]   drinking coffee, continuing listening to an audio book about Rocketfield. I mean, in some sense,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.760]   I was a little bit delirious, just happy. I'm truly happy, but sort of don't want to be talking
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.000]   right now. I don't want to be recording videos. Just want to jump in the shower and get some sleep
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.120]   and get back to work. So things I'm thankful for, maybe kind of silly to say, but just
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.280]   my academic journey in general has revealed a lot to me and the ups and downs of it. I'm really
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:57.120]   thankful for it. From the BS/MS PhD that I got in computer science, computer engineering, and
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.160]   focusing on machine learning and artificial intelligence. So getting exposure to the
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.600]   exciting full space from theoretical computer science, to math, to physics, quantum mechanics,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.480]   classical mechanics, to even literature. I took a James Joyce course. I mean, just getting,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.040]   going to college, I love learning. And then getting an opportunity to do research. One of
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.280]   the best places in the world in industry is at Google. Machine learning, especially earlier days
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:30.560]   of deep learning was really exciting. And of course, then to MIT, to a much less sunnier Boston,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:37.520]   but brilliant people from all walks of life. The close-knit colleagues, the friends I've developed
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:44.400]   here and more distant from physics to mathematics, to brain and cognitive sciences and neuroscience,
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:54.080]   to the business side of Sloan, to psychology. I've gotten to experience that. I've grown a lot
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.000]   through that, just having the opportunity to be here. And that opportunity also gave me even the
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.880]   bigger gift to realize the dreams I've had always, and the dreams that burns now of having a large
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:15.840]   scale impact of working in large teams collaboratively on one big moonshot project.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.800]   It's something that's much, it's very difficult to do in the academic setting. And so it took me to
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:30.480]   go to MIT to understand that that's not the right place for me to realize the dream I have. So all
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.000]   of that is a beautiful gift. I couldn't ask it any other way. I'm really grateful for it. Grateful
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.840]   for all the friends I had, grateful for the connections I still have at MIT, and perhaps
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:48.400]   forever will be connected to MIT and the broader academic community. It's a real gift that I'm
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.640]   thankful for. Okay. On to the next few miles, just a few left. I don't know how many more. I'm not
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.000]   even letting myself think about it, but I'm excited to get it done. I said, I'm going to get it done.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:10.480]   I'm going to get it done. Let's go. Okay. I'm going to try to make this quick. Not feeling great.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   That was 32 miles and it's getting rough. I had to actually walk a little bit of that.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.120]   The thing I'm grateful for, it sounds funny to say, but the community of people on the internet,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.000]   supporters in general, people on Patreon, people who have had discussion through email,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.640]   through social networks. Also might be funny to say, but I'm really grateful to the people,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.560]   the companies, and actually the people behind those companies that sponsored the podcast.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:52.880]   I didn't take on sponsors for a while, but there was a point where I really, literally needed money
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:00.160]   for food and shelter and so on. I thought that monetization might not get in the way of the
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.680]   deep conversation. That's why I really wanted to just do it in the beginning.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:11.040]   I connected with the company Cash App and they decided to sponsor the podcast. They made it
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:18.640]   really easy. They took a risk on me, I guess. A guy named Navid, especially. There's a bunch,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.960]   there's really good people, really good people. I was surprised how pleasant and fulfilling the
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:33.280]   experience can be to tell others to use a thing that I already used. The funny thing about Cash
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:40.560]   App is because they sponsored, it opened up this floodgate. I don't know if it's because of them,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:47.280]   or just the general growth of the podcast, but the floodgate of other people, the ones that
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.720]   sponsored the podcast opened up and allows me to completely freely choose. My hands are
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.880]   totally not tied. I don't have to be sponsored by Cash App at all. Everybody else, ExpressVPN,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:04.000]   incredible thing I've used for a long time. Masterclass, this place where you can watch
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:13.360]   videos from the most brilliant people in their field. Chris Hadfield talking about how rockets
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:24.240]   work is just incredible. The fact that they would want to support the podcast is so cool.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.440]   There's many others that I could choose from. I'm really grateful for that support too.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   Just in general, it allows me to survive doing something I love, which is these deep conversations
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.000]   and podcast form while I work on the main thing that is my journey, the startup that I'm working
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.400]   on. I'm deeply grateful for that, for the financial, for the emotional, the psychological,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:58.160]   mental, the physical support, all kinds of support. Just people reaching out and being kind,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:05.360]   giving me strength. I deeply appreciate that. I'm sorry if I look like a mess. These videos
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:11.600]   are really tough to record. I really don't want to record them. I am really struggling to even
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:18.560]   finish this freaking thing. Not sure I should be recording myself in this state, but hopefully it's
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:26.640]   valuable to somebody to see the fragility. For some runners, this might be just hard, but not
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:38.480]   too hard. For me, I'm not a runner. This is rough. I said I'm going to finish. I have to finish.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:54.400]   Let's go. All right. I think 36 miles down, 11 a.m. session, and four cups of coffee afterwards,
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:04.080]   like little cups, with actually a cappuccino on my cappuccino machine that I found free coffee,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.640]   and I couldn't stop. I'm feeling weirdly energetic. Body's feeling all right. I'm just not
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.040]   letting my mind listen to the body. There's no injuries. That's really important thing,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:22.800]   the shin splints. Hamstring from jiu-jitsu is just, it's there. It's there. It's like a little
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:32.240]   reminder that I'm still alive, but it's also affecting my pace. I'm saying I slid from maybe
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:39.920]   a nine-minute mile pace to a 10-minute mile pace, so just focusing on taking one step at a time,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.760]   feeling all right. A little bit of a headache. I think it's a salt issue that I need to get some
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.280]   more sodium in, whatever they're called, electrolytes, whatever. Some people have
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.880]   been asking what I'm eating. I'm eating just meat, same thing I always eat, feeling good
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:05.600]   overall energy-wise. As I said before, people made fun of me, but I eat low-carb. When I travel,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:14.560]   I eat McDonald's, even here. I eat McDonald's, just the beef patties. Yesterday, I made the
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:21.600]   giant mistake because my body, my mind, for some reason, wanted an oven-roasted chicken
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:31.120]   from a grocery store. Six bucks, so it's cheap. It always looks delicious when it's right there.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:38.560]   I took it home. That sounds weird to say. It's like a little Thanksgiving dinner. I was planning
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.160]   to eat maybe a quarter, a half. I ended up eating the whole thing, so I regretted that. In general,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.520]   I've been just feeling a little bit too full. I've been overeating, which is not good when
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.440]   you're running every four miles. It's interesting. I think because I only eat once a day or twice a
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   day at most, this adjustment was necessary to me. My body, my mind is refusing to make the
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.840]   adjustments, so I've just been overeating. For people wondering if I'm losing weight,
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.240]   I probably gained weight from this whole challenge just because I've just been eating and
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:20.320]   drinking tons of coffee. Who cares? I'm not doing this to lose weight. I don't care how much I weigh.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:27.280]   I care how I feel. In general, I run. The way I eat is because I want to feel good.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.840]   Eating meat has made me feel really good. I don't care what I look like. I care that I feel good,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:39.520]   and it made me feel good. It helped me focus the mind and so on. I wanted to talk about diet a
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:45.680]   little bit because for some weird reason, I'm feeling really good right now. It's ups and downs.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:52.720]   That's the amazing thing about life is if you take just one step at a time, you can feel horrible. I
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:59.520]   think the 7 a.m. run, I just felt horrible. For this one, I felt pretty good. If you take one
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:07.040]   step at a time, the suffering will end and the good times will come. I'm feeling good right now.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:17.120]   Next one will probably be the hardest one. 3 p.m. is because the body's right now,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.320]   I really just want to rest. There's no glory in finishing the 11th session.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:28.800]   There's glory finishing the whole thing. It's just one step at a time. One step at a time.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:35.440]   Something I'm grateful for, I've been doing a podcast called Artificial Intelligence. Maybe
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:42.640]   you listen. One of the things I'm grateful for is how many people for no reason whatsoever
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:50.320]   said, "Yes, they'll do it." They've been really kind and generous with their time, with their
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:58.000]   mind, opening up their mind to my style of questioning, to my attempts and growth and
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.560]   learning of how to question, how to have conversations, some of the busiest. Basically,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.760]   my whole strategy has been asking silly, profound questions of the busiest engineers in the world.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:17.840]   The fact that Elon Musk twice carved out time from his day to have a conversation
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:25.040]   with me about artificial intelligence, consciousness, the human brain, and autonomous
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:33.680]   vehicles is incredible. Everybody else, Don Knuth, I'm so deeply grateful for people I've
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:42.080]   looked up to like Don. Don offered me hot dogs after the conversation. I could die happy now.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:48.480]   Don Knuth offered me, had a long, amazing conversation, welcomed me into his home,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:55.600]   and offered me hot dogs afterwards, to go out for hot dogs. How freaking amazing is that?
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:07.200]   I'm so grateful for Eric Schmidt, Eric Weinstein, Sean Carroll, the physicists, mathematicians,
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:14.240]   computer scientists, neuroscientists, philosophers, historians. Everybody has
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:23.680]   kindly sat down and said yes at first, sat down and just listened. When you become famous,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:30.160]   a few of the folks, many of the folks I've spoken with, it's so rewarding to see
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:38.000]   that they still truly listen to the human. Most of them don't, "Who am I? I'm just some kid
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.520]   sitting before them." The fact that they would listen to me and really look into my eyes and
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:50.240]   wonder, "What is this kid about?" Really, generally, human to human, be able to connect
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:59.200]   throughout the busyness, the chaos of their day. That made me so happy about the human race,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:05.920]   that no matter where you are, no matter how small or big you are, you can still connect
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.560]   on a human level. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to learn that, for the opportunity
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:16.720]   to share that with the world and with the great community of people through the podcast medium,
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:23.440]   which is like, which I think is the one of the exciting mediums of the future for long-form
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.880]   conversation. I would say it was started with Joe Rogan really brought to life that long-form
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.840]   two, three, four-hour conversations. There's a hunger for them. He made me realize that.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:40.800]   The fact that there's a platform for it, super grateful for it. All right, back to running.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.520]   Clearly, I'm feeling weirdly good. It's very strange. Probably going to do some work now,
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:52.240]   get a little bit of work done, get back on the road, finish this thing, refuse to quit. I said,
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.000]   "I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it." Looking forward to the last few miles. Let's go.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:10.720]   All right, I'm going to keep this short. I did 40 miles, took a shower. I did swap out one of
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:16.800]   the sessions for a Jiu-Jitsu session, but I decided I'm going to stay true to the 48-hour,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.440]   48-mile challenge. I'm going to try for, I'm not going to try, I'm going to do it.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:31.760]   I'm going to do eight miles, an eight-mile run at 7 p.m. My body is just exhausted muscle-wise,
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.960]   but there's no injuries, period. That's it. Nothing else to say. It's just the mind now,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:43.280]   beautiful test. I'm really glad I did it. There's a lot to think about, a lot to learn from. I'll
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.560]   remember this experience for a long time. I'm not so sure. I'm glad I did the video. I still have
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.400]   to watch it, maybe edit it down. There's way too much talking, but maybe this kind of sharing is
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.720]   useful for people. I'm really grateful for the hardship that my life has presented. I've had
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.880]   a lot of ways in which I've been tested throughout my life, and I'm really fortunate for that.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:13.280]   Some of them, many of them, especially recently, have been self-imposed in me choosing certain
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:21.360]   decisions in my career to really challenge myself in every kind of way. Also, tests like this,
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.840]   which are really fun little divergences in life into a totally different direction.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:36.480]   I'm grateful for people who love me back, actually, but wanted nothing more for me but to
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.880]   be comfortable and to be mediocre. One of the things, for some reason, there's a fire in me
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.960]   that refuses to be mediocre. When everybody tells me, even my parents or people who love me,
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:55.440]   to slow down, to take it easy, to relax, to take... What is it? Somebody in the internet says,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:03.200]   "Hot bath with some soap." I don't know. I'm sure rubber duckies will be involved.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.880]   I don't do hot baths, and I don't do mediocrity. Whenever people tell me that, I hear it,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.400]   and it's a beautiful thing because I feel the love in that, but I also refuse to give into
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:24.000]   that kind of advice to be comfortable. I enjoy the richness, the deep beauty of every moment,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:35.840]   so I'm grateful for that, but I'm also endlessly unsatisfied with not realizing the potential that
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:42.880]   I believe I have. I really have a belief, a dream that I'm driving towards, not comparing myself to
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.840]   others. I don't care if I'm famous or my name attached to it or if I'm successful under any
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:54.800]   kind of dimension that this world presents itself, but I have a dream, and I want to realize that
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:03.280]   dream and the opportunity to take that on, to take the full challenge of that, to have the will
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:08.640]   and the dragon I have to defeat to go to the castle, princess or not. Who cares about the
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:15.760]   princess? It's about the dragon, and then maybe the princess can help me slay the dragon too,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.960]   but I'm grateful for that opportunity, for that hardship, and looking forward to 7 p.m. to crush
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:29.680]   that eight miles and enjoy a nice hot cup of coffee, maybe a steak. Let's go.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:46.640]   All right, here we are. It's hard to believe, but it's 40 miles down, zero to go.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:57.920]   Some people kind of look to the next thing right away. To me, I really enjoy these moments.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:07.520]   I purposely routed out, so it's a 10-mile route, so I get to walk now for a couple miles.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:17.360]   Legs are definitely shot, but I feel good mentally. It's probably the hardest thing
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:26.800]   that I've ever done physically. I'm feeling really good now, but I would say session seven,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:34.080]   eight, and nine, and maybe 10, or it's really, really rough mentally. I had to kind of suck it
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.600]   up and not to think about it, but if I had to take any kind of lessons from this is if you really
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:48.000]   take one step at a time, you can accomplish a lot. So I really let my mind sort of meditate on the
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   moment, really focus on the moment, take it one step at a time, and not think about the future,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.120]   not plan for the future, and got the job done. As silly as it is to say, I'm really grateful to be
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:08.240]   alive. Really I'm dreading the whole fact that it ends eventually, but while it lasts, I'm going to
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:15.840]   enjoy the hell out of it. And I'm glad I did this. It's been rough at times mentally, physically,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:21.520]   but if anyone gets an opportunity to test themselves in this kind of different kind of way,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:30.720]   I highly recommend it. Big thank you to David Goggins for challenging the world and for letting
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.240]   me in on the challenge by seeing it on Instagram, wherever the heck I saw it. For everyone out there
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:44.080]   that's actually listened to this, I hope there's some value to it. Keep pushing yourself to whatever
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:51.040]   your limit is intellectually, physically, and most importantly, keep putting love out there in the
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:57.920]   world. I love you all. Keep grinding. Let's see what the next challenge holds. Let's see what the
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.560]   next exciting opportunity that life brings us.
