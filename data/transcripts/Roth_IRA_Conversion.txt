[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode, I want to talk about
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.780]   the Roth IRA conversion and why doing one is probably a waste of time and money for
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.780]   most of us.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.840]   Now, if the House Ways and Means Committee has its way, there's a chance, a good chance,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.520]   doing a Roth IRA conversion will be no more in 22 and beyond.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.480]   And frankly, I'm pretty agnostic to ending our ability to convert our traditional IRAs
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.200]   to Roth IRAs.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.520]   I've really had this kind of weird love-hate relationship with Roth IRAs since I started
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.760]   Financial Samurai in 2009 because I couldn't contribute to a Roth IRA about the second
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.580]   year after I started work.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.680]   And so therefore, I felt kind of salty thinking, "Well, why do other people get to contribute
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.280]   to a Roth IRA and I can't?"
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280]   And it's the same thing with traditional IRAs.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.040]   Once you make above a certain amount for a traditional IRA, you just can't contribute.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.800]   So I really forgot about contributing to a traditional and to a Roth IRA for a long time.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.840]   But I slowly changed my mind and my way of thinking once I became a father in 2017 because
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.400]   I think about my kid's future and I think about how much more expensive things will
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.480]   be 10, 20, 30 years from now, right?
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.460]   Housing, food prices, tuition, healthcare, cars, everything.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.760]   Everything is going to be much more expensive.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.840]   So we need to continuously invest so we can beat inflation or at least keep up with inflation.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.040]   Therefore, I put my kids to work, doing menial tasks, making a little bit of money.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.480]   But thanks to the standard deduction, they don't have to pay taxes on their income.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.680]   And given our forward thinking, I'm getting them to invest in their custodial Roth IRAs.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.560]   So they get to contribute to a Roth IRA tax-free, which is very different from the way normal
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.600]   people contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.480]   It's with after-tax money and then it gets to grow and compound tax-free and it's tax-free
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.780]   when you pull it out.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.860]   But for kids who are earning less than the standard deduction, which is $12,550, or not
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.900]   just kids, anybody, it's a good idea to contribute to a Roth IRA because it's tax-free in, tax-free
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.760]   growth and tax-free out.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.660]   It's a win-win-win.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.680]   But I didn't realize all the benefits and this way of thinking because in 1998, when
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.360]   a Roth IRA was first introduced as a savings and retirement vehicle, I was a junior in
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   college.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.720]   I was a junior in college looking for a job and the last thing on my mind was trying to
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.200]   save for retirement because I didn't have much money.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.480]   I just needed to find a job.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   But now we know.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.060]   Ah, so right now there's like no excuse not to contribute to a Roth IRA if you're in a
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.020]   very low income tax bracket.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.660]   But what if you are in a moderate to higher income tax bracket?
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:07.180]   So once you make over $76,000 or more, you can't contribute to a traditional IRA.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.220]   And once you make more than $140,000, you can't contribute to a Roth IRA either.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.420]   So what is a person to do?
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.620]   Should you really do a Roth IRA conversion and pay taxes up front?
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:31.760]   I think the answer is probably not unless you are in the 0% tax bracket, 10%, 12%, 24%.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   And after that, I just think it's a wash or you're going to be losing money.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.960]   And here's why.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.700]   First of all, tax rates are unlikely to go up for the middle class because the politicians
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.060]   we have depend on the middle class for votes and to stay in power.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.100]   Now the median household income is about $69,000 and a common definition of middle class is
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.980]   plus or minus 50% on the median.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.380]   So we can talk about a middle class income going up to about $105,000 nationwide.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.420]   However, half the population lives on the more expensive coasts.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.300]   For example, for a family of four in San Francisco, you can be considered low income if you have
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.420]   a $117,000 income or less.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.500]   Therefore, you can argue that a middle class income for a household of four or five can
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.780]   go up to about $300,000.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.100]   And that might sound like a lot to some folks who live in low cost of living areas.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.600]   But the reality is the nation is not even in terms of cost of living.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.180]   And I think it's very consistent because President Biden has said he would not raise taxes on
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.540]   anybody making less than $400,000.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.100]   So $400,000 for an individual he clarified and $450,000 for a couple, which doesn't make
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.300]   sense because 400,000 plus 400,000 equals 800,000 and not 450,000.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.580]   But this is a very traditional way of thinking the government has where one spouse or partner
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.000]   stays at home.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.400]   The traditional IRA and Roth IRA are retirement vehicles for the middle class.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.980]   And if middle class tax rates aren't going up, then it doesn't really matter if you do
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.340]   a traditional or you convert to a Roth IRA because the math dictates so.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.640]   Let's say you're 40 years old and make $65,000 a year, you're a single person.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.740]   This income level puts you in the 22% marginal federal income tax bracket.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.220]   If you invest $6,000 in a traditional IRA, and it grows at 8% a year for 20 years, you'll
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.260]   end up with $27,965.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.100]   And when you withdraw the money, you decide to withdraw all of it and pay the same 22%
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.220]   marginal federal income tax.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.140]   Therefore, you end up with $21,813.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.620]   Now let's say on the other hand, you contribute to a Roth IRA, you have to pay 22% tax on
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.420]   that 6,000 upfront, leaving you with $4,680.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:14.460]   If it grows at the same 8% a year for 20 years at age 60, you can withdraw tax free $21,813.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.780]   In other words, the results are the same.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.300]   So if the math is the same, because the tax rates are the same, input output the same,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.620]   then it really doesn't matter.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.100]   So in that regard, you're wasting time trying to do a Roth IRA conversion.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.180]   The other really important point is that your income will likely be lower in retirement
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.660]   than while working.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.660]   This makes logical sense.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.980]   In retirement, you're not working, you're relaxing, you're living off your savings and
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.220]   investments and Social Security and maybe a pension.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.260]   Generally, that is much less than your highest income earning years or your average income
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.260]   earning years.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.340]   Therefore, if you're making less in retirement, which most of us do, since we're not working,
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.500]   we're probably going to be in a lower marginal income tax rate.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.740]   Further, your Social Security income actually isn't fully taxed.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.740]   Did you know that?
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.140]   I didn't really know that until recently.
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.780]   The portion of your Social Security benefits subject to taxation varies with income levels.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:24.220]   So you'll be taxed on up to 50% of your benefits if your income is $25,000 to $34,000 for an
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.260]   individual or $32,000 to $44,000 for a married couple.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.300]   You'll be taxed up to 85% of your benefits if your income is more than $34,000 for an
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.300]   individual or $44,000 per couple.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.380]   So in other words, not 100% of your Social Security benefits will ever be taxed.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.380]   Pretty good.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.100]   Now let's say you are a top 1% or you're going to end up being a top 1%.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.980]   Now Roth IRAs are more valuable for those in the top 1% net worths or top 1% incomes
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:01.060]   in retirement because it could be used for tax planning for those dealing with a larger
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.260]   estate because their heirs can draw the money tax free.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.660]   So let's say you're a lucky individual working 100 hours a week.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.700]   You never see your kids, don't see your friends, gain a lot of weight, but you're making $700,000
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.700]   a year.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.020]   You're living large, right?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:23.420]   You're in the top 1% and you're concerned about paying 39.6% marginal federal income
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.940]   tax rate in retirement versus what you're paying now, which is 37%.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:34.700]   So you decide to do a Roth IRA conversion and you pay 37% rate upfront.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.060]   That's crazy.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.180]   That is crazy.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.980]   But you do it anyway, even though you were only in the 22% marginal income tax bracket
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.900]   years ago when you were contributing to your traditional IRA.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.820]   So therefore you're locking in a 15% loss with the potential for only saving 2.6% in
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.780]   federal income taxes in the future.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.780]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:01.340]   I don't think that makes sense, but you're really, really bullish on your future.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.620]   So what happens 20 years from now?
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.100]   20 years from now, you amass a fortune of let's say $15 million.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.580]   And out of the 15 million, 5 million is in a Roth IRA conversion.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.500]   5 million is in your after tax brokerage accounts because you need that passive income.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.620]   3 million is in your primary residence and 2 million is in rental properties.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:29.980]   So okay, you're in the top 1% net worth, which currently has a cutoff of about $10 million
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980]   at the minimum.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.060]   So it's already hard enough to generate a top 1% income.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.980]   It's another thing to consistently save and invest 50% of your after tax earnings for
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.220]   that long.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.700]   Most people don't.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.460]   We've all heard plenty of stories of people making a lot of money, way more than $700,000
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.900]   a year and ending up broke.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.660]   So these are two unlikely things that are going to happen, right?
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.980]   Huge income, huge savings.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.960]   But regardless, you did it.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.260]   You are just the man or the woman with the financial plan and everything is going fantastically
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.260]   well.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:13.220]   So in those 20 years, you were actually living off "only" $200,000 a year, right?
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:19.140]   Because after taxes and saving 50% of your after tax income, you only got about $250,000
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.980]   left out of your $700,000.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.880]   So let's say you're in retirement, life is short, so you decide to bump up your target
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.140]   spend from $200,000 a year to $300,000 a year.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.580]   I don't think it's feasible to comfortably spend that much more money, 50% more money
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.680]   when you're used to spending a certain amount for two decades.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   But let's just continuously be conservative with this example.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:53.420]   Now after withdrawing 2.4% from your $5 million Roth IRA conversion, you get your total income
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.500]   up to about $336,000.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.360]   That's pretty good.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:04.860]   But the marginal federal income tax rate at $336,000 is 35%, which is still lower than
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.140]   your 39.6% when you did the Roth IRA conversion.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.020]   So once again, you lose.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.500]   Now obviously tax rates could be higher, but we just made an argument that up to about
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.740]   $300,000, inflation adjusted, politicians aren't going to raise taxes on people making
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.980]   that much because that is considered middle class for some people in the country.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.480]   You would probably have to start withdrawing closer to 4% from your Roth IRA or $200,000
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.080]   to add on to the passive income your dividend stocks and your rental properties are generating
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:47.240]   to get to $400,000 plus to potentially pay more in taxes and retirement than while you're
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.720]   working, potentially.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.080]   Now again, to have all that, to generate all that income, you need to have a net worth
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.400]   of about $15 million and we know that less than 1% of people have a net worth of more
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.880]   than $10 million.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.760]   So to get to $15 million, it's definitely less than 1%.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.680]   Getting to $15 million is unlikely to happen for more than 99% of the population.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.280]   Inflation adjusted again.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.720]   So let's please be realistic with your expectations.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.440]   If you're doing a Roth IRA conversion because you believe you're going to pay higher taxes
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.200]   in retirement than while working, it's illogical.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   It's unlikely.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   It could happen.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   It could happen.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.920]   You could certainly win the lottery, invest in some massive multi-bagger that goes public.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   It could happen.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.360]   It happens all the time with less than 1% of the population, but you've just got to
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   be realistic with the numbers.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:51.000]   For a quick calculation, take whatever you're making right now and divide it by 3% and 4%.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.960]   The result is your likely liquid net worth target necessary to be able to generate a
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.920]   similar level of income in retirement.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.020]   If you have a similar level of income in retirement, your tax bill likely won't increase.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.800]   So instead, divide your current income by 2% to get to a liquid net worth target that
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.880]   may cause for your tax rate to increase in retirement.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.480]   The other thing with doing a Roth IRA conversion is this.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.400]   Once you do it, it's like surrendering to the government.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.960]   Sure, you'll get the tax-free benefits upon withdrawal, but even that is not a certainty.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.240]   The government could always pass new legislation, right?
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.320]   And all of us have the ability to adjust our income and therefore our tax rates in retirement.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   We could move to more tax-efficient states.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.800]   We could rebalance our portfolios to non-dividend paying investments.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.080]   We could donate more of our wealth to charity while living, gift more of our wealth to our
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.600]   children and other individuals.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   We can invest in non-income producing investments like venture capital, start a business with
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   lots of deductions, and we can withdraw at different rates.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.160]   There's no rule that says once you hit age 59 and a half and over, you have to withdraw
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:13.840]   100% from your 401(k), Roth IRA, traditional IRA, and so forth.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   You can keep that there.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.440]   You can just dribble it out if you want and you can play with the numbers based on your
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.960]   needs and desires.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.240]   So I think more of us should keep that call option, keep that flexibility.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.400]   Now in terms of the best time to do a Roth IRA conversion, I got to thinking about my
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.720]   own scenario.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.000]   For me, that year was 2013.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.080]   It was my lowest income earning year because the first full year I didn't have a job.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.280]   I stopped receiving a steady paycheck in June 2012.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.480]   Unfortunately or fortunately, even as an unemployed person, I was still in the 28% marginal federal
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:58.400]   income tax bracket, which is $87,000 to $183,000 for individuals because tax rates were higher
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.720]   back then.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.500]   Further, I was earning passive income, some online income, and had deferred investment
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.640]   income as part of my severance package coming in for the next four years.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:17.160]   So the last thing I want to do as an unemployed person who just saw over 60, 70% of his income
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:23.560]   go away is to pay six figures in taxes to do a Roth IRA conversion.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.760]   Therefore I decided to just roll over my 401(k) into a traditional IRA and just keep what
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.000]   I had.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.120]   You'll probably feel the same way in terms of desiring to hold on to as much wealth as
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.520]   possible if you ever lose your job.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:46.680]   Or it's not as easy as you think once you're in a very low income tax bracket after being
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.800]   in a high income tax bracket or a higher income tax bracket for many, many years.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.000]   So the best time to do a Roth IRA conversion is when you are unemployed with little to
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.360]   no other income sources.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.120]   At a 0%, 10%, or 12% marginal income tax bracket, it's probably a no-brainer to do a Roth IRA
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   conversion.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.840]   But even paying 10% to 12% of your traditional IRA in taxes is going to hurt.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.400]   So I'm not sure you'll want to do it even though it's probably the right move.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   So in conclusion, I say if you are currently in the 24% tax bracket or lower, you have
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.720]   a positive probability that doing a Roth IRA conversion will save you taxes in the long
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   run.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:40.400]   If you are in the 32%, 35%, 37%, and future 39.6% tax rate, I would say don't bother.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.800]   If you can contribute to a Roth IRA when you're coming up, you know, you're in college, first
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.960]   years of work, go do it.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.320]   Diversify your retirement income streams.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.480]   But after you've surpassed those income limits, I would just stick to your 401(k) traditional
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.640]   IRA and just save aggressively in your after-tax investment accounts.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.120]   And at the end of the day, if you end up paying more in taxes than you could have in retirement,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.360]   then just feel grateful you did so well because paying more taxes means that you ended up
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.680]   making more money.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.560]   So thanks so much everyone for listening.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.840]   And if you are vehemently against what I just said, and if you strongly believe that a Roth
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.760]   IRA conversion makes sense, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.560]   I want to hear both sides of the story because this is real life and this is real money and
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.000]   we have a deadline potentially of 2022.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.720]   And if you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a positive review.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   I read all the comments and I appreciate them so much.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.240]   Cheers.
