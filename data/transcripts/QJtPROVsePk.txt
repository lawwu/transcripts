[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   Communism makes no sense at all, totally opposed to human nature.
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.180]   It never works.
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.220]   It always evolves into dictatorship.
[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.260]   It creates a power vacuum.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620]   When you say, Hey, there's no structure of power here, right?
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.500]   We're all equal.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.420]   It's a flat line.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.940]   One guy usually gets up because that's human nature and goes, I don't think so.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.660]   I think if you're going to leave a power vacuum, I'm going to take that power vacuum.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.180]   Corporatism hates competition.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.320]   It wants monopoly and oligopoly power.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.080]   Whereas capitalism loves competition and wants to free markets.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.140]   When mainstream media has you hooked, you got no hope because you
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.900]   don't have the right information.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   You have propaganda, you have marketing, you don't have real news.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.780]   When you're in the online world, it's chaotic and don't get me wrong.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.780]   It's got plenty of downsides, right?
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.280]   But within that chaos, the truth begins to emerge.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.880]   Trump is a massive risk because of all the things we talked about earlier.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.780]   But there is a percentage chance that he's such a wild card that
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.120]   he overturns the whole system.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.340]   And that is why the establishment is a little scared of him.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.320]   The following is a conversation with Cenk Uygur, a progressive political
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680]   commentator and host of the Young Turks.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.080]   As I've said before, I will speak with everyone, including on the left and
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.600]   the right of the political spectrum.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.360]   Always in good faith with empathy, rigor, and backbone.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.420]   Sometimes I fail.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.560]   Sometimes I say stupid, inaccurate, ineloquent things.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.620]   And I frequently change my mind as I'm learning and thinking about the world.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.840]   For all this, I often get attacked sometimes fairly, sometimes not, but
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.120]   just know that I'm aware when I fall short and I will keep trying to do better.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.800]   I love you all.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.940]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it, please check out
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.580]   our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.440]   And now dear friends, here's Cenk Uygur.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.060]   You wrote a book, a manifesto that outlines the
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.480]   progressive vision for America.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.140]   So the big question, what are some defining ideas of progressivism?
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660]   Yes.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.860]   So in order to do that, Lex, we got to talk about where we
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.060]   are in the political spectrum.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.680]   And, uh, in fact, there's two different, uh, spectrums now.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.460]   People often think of left, right.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.800]   Uh, and that's true that exists, but layered on top of that is
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.660]   now populist versus establishment.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.640]   So I'm center left on the left, right spectrum.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.500]   Um, but I'm all the way on that populist end of, of the second spectrum.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.940]   So where does progressivism lie within that?
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.580]   Well, uh, I would argue that it's exactly in those places.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.820]   It's populist, uh, and it's on the left, but it is not far left.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.820]   So far left is a different animal.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.460]   And we could talk about that in a little bit.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.420]   So in terms of what makes a progressive, so expand the circle of liberty and, uh,
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.200]   justice for all and equality of opportunity.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.220]   Now people will say, well, that seems pretty broad and all American, but is it?
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.180]   Think about it.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.020]   So expand the circle of liberty.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.780]   Uh, everybody's in favor of that, right?
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.140]   No, absolutely not.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.220]   So, uh, certainly the King of England was not in favor of expanding the circle of
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.940]   liberty and the founding father said, we're going to expand it and they
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.060]   expanded it to property to white men.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.660]   And then progressives have been their progressives because they
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.900]   expanded the circle of liberty.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.240]   They then from then on, as we were perfecting the union, progressives
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.180]   always say, expand it further, include women, include people without property,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.300]   include all races, and at every turn conservatives fight against it.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.900]   So that doesn't mean if you're a conservative today, you don't want to
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.660]   include women or, uh, minorities, et cetera, but, but today you would say,
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.980]   for example, well, I don't want to expand the circle of liberty to, for
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.500]   example, undocumented immigrants.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.140]   And maybe you're right about that.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.220]   And we could have that discussion in terms of a specific philosophy.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.380]   And I don't believe that undocumented immigrants should immediately be
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.980]   citizens or anything along those lines.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.500]   But I do believe in expanding liberty overall.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.580]   And the contours of that are what's interesting.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.140]   And then you see justice for all everybody's for just no, right now,
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.540]   marijuana possession is still illegal in a lot of parts of the country.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.820]   Now, a lot of right-wingers and left-wingers agree that it should be legal.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.180]   But for my entire lifetime, uh, black people have been arrested at about
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.100]   3.7 times the rate of white people and the entire country has been fine with it.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.020]   So is that justice?
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.980]   No, they smoke white people.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.380]   Black people smoke marijuana at the same rate.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.140]   Black people get arrested about four times the rate.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.260]   That is an injustice that an enormous percentage of the
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.580]   country was comfortable with.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.420]   Well, progressives aren't comfortable with it.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.860]   We want justice for all.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.100]   So the quality of opportunity is an interesting one because the far left
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.420]   will say, so at least some portions of them will say equality of results, right?
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.740]   So progressives just want a fair chance.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.340]   So free college education, but afterwards you don't get to have exact same results
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.740]   as either the wealthiest person, or we're not all going to be equal.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.060]   We don't have equal talents, skills, abilities, et cetera.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.500]   There's a lot of questions I can ask there.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.020]   So on the circle of liberty, yes.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.060]   So expanding the number of people whose freedoms are protected.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.540]   But what about the magnitude of freedom for each individual person?
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.060]   So expanding the freedom of the individual and protecting
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.300]   the freedoms of the individual.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.580]   It seems like progressives are more willing to expand the size of government
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.540]   where government can do all kinds of regulation, all kinds
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.820]   of controls on the individual.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.380]   So Lex, what we're probably going to talk about a lot today is balance.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.220]   And so a lot of people think, oh, I I'm on the right, I'm on the left.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.980]   And that comes with a certain preset ideology.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.020]   So the right is always correct.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.460]   The left is always correct.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.060]   So there's two problems with that.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.740]   Number one, how could you possibly believe in a preset ideology?
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.660]   If you're an independent thinker, it's literally by definition, not possible.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.940]   If you say I lent my brain to an ideology that was created 80 years ago or eight
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.820]   years ago, or 800 years ago, and I'm not going to change it, you're
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.340]   saying, I don't think for myself.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.940]   I, you know, I bought into a culture and by the way, there's a lot of different
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.700]   forms of culture you could buy into religion, politics, sometimes, uh, racial,
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.580]   et cetera, so that's why you need actually balance the same reason you need balance
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.820]   other than independent thought is because the answer is almost never black and white.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.100]   And that gets into a really interesting nuance because mainstream
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.900]   media, in my opinion, is the matrix.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.220]   And its job is to delude you into thinking corporate rule is great
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.220]   for you and we should never change it.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.020]   And the status quo is wonderful.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.020]   So they have created a false middle.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.020]   What mainstream media calls moderate is actually, in my opinion,
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.500]   extremist corporate ideology.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.340]   So for example, they'll say Joe Manchin is a moderate.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.180]   None of his positions are moderate other than potentially
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.060]   gun control in West Virginia.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.700]   He's not for gun control.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.900]   The people of West Virginia are not for gun control, generally speaking.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.140]   So, and he uses that and they usually have these shiny objects
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.340]   where they're like, you see this.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.980]   I'm a moderate because of guns, or I'm a moderate because I'm
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.420]   a Democrat from West Virginia.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.980]   But wait, let's look at your positions.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.900]   You're against paid family leave that polls at 84%.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.500]   So you're a radical corporatist who say that women should be forced back into
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.100]   work the day after they have birth.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.220]   You're against the higher minimum wage.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.420]   You're against, you're for every corporate position and
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.860]   they all poll at 33% or less.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.420]   So Joe Manchin is not at all a moderate.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.980]   And this applies to almost every corporate Republican
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.260]   and every corporate Democrat.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.060]   They're all extremists in, in supporting what I call corporatism.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.140]   So you have to get to a balance in order to get to the right answer.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.700]   So that's an interesting distinction here.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.660]   So you're actually, as far as I understand, pro-capitalism.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.300]   Yes.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.780]   Which is an interesting place to be.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.740]   That's the thing that probably makes you center left and then still populist.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.380]   You're, you're full of beautiful contradictions.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.620]   Let's say this, which will be great to untangle.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.700]   But what's the difference between corporatism and capitalism?
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.660]   Is there a difference?
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.420]   So I really believe in capitalism.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.140]   I don't think that there's really a second choice.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.220]   Um, the, where it gets super interesting is the distinction between capitalism
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.260]   and socialism, because that's not at all as clear as people think it is.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.940]   And people often say socialism and communism as synonyms when
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.260]   they're not synonyms, right?
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.740]   And so I view it as, there's basically four distinct areas.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.900]   It's obviously a spectrum.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.060]   Everything's a spectrum, right?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.620]   On one end, you have communism on the left and on the other end,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.140]   you have corporatism on the right.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.860]   Okay.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.180]   And I would argue that capitalism is in the middle.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:18.460]   And so communism, we know, uh, state owns all property.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.900]   You're not allowed to have private property.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.900]   So I will piss off a lot of people in this show.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.740]   And so I'm asking for their patience, please hear me out.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.820]   And because don't worry, I'm going to piss off the other side too.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.700]   Okay.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.300]   So communism makes no sense at all, totally opposed to human nature.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.860]   It never works.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.380]   It always evolves into dictatorship because it is
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.700]   not built for human nature.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.140]   It, we're never going to act like that.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.900]   It's not in our DNA.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.620]   You could try to wish it into existence and they have, and it never works.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.780]   And it's because once you have almost no rules in terms of, uh, Oh, we're all
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.380]   equal and even though communism eventually winds up having an enormous
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.540]   amount of rules, right?
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.940]   Uh, it creates a power vacuum when you say, Hey, there's no
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.940]   structure of power here, right?
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.820]   We're all equal.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.740]   It's a flat line.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.340]   One guy usually gets up because that's human nature and goes,
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.260]   Oh, I don't think so.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.900]   I think if you're going to leave a power vacuum, I'm going
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.980]   to take that power vacuum.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.340]   That's actually a really interesting way to put it because when everyone is equal,
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.580]   nobody is in power and human nature is such that there's everybody's,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.580]   there's a will to power.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.660]   So when you create a power vacuum, somebody is going to, to fill it.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.500]   So the alternative is to have people in power, but there's a balance of power.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.820]   And then there's like a democratic system that elects the people in power
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.820]   and keeps churning and rotating.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.580]   Cause that is exactly it.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.580]   Lex, you got it exactly right in my opinion.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.180]   Okay.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.180]   So that's why communism never works and can never work.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.620]   So they, it's an idea of like, we're all going to work as hard as we
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.700]   possibly can and take only what we need.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.260]   Where, when, when has that ever happened in the history of humanity?
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:07.700]   Right.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.060]   We're just not built that way.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.220]   So, okay.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.020]   We can get into that debate with my friends on the left, et cetera.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.660]   Now, corporatism is just as extreme and just as dangerous.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.220]   And that is basically what we have in America now.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.380]   Well, we have an American now, and this is another giant trick that
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.940]   the matrix played on everybody that they, they did in a shell game.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.980]   And all of a sudden extreme corporatists like mansion and almost every
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.620]   Republican in the Senate are moderates.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.300]   Oh my God.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.260]   Mitch McConnell all of a sudden is a moderate and, uh, et cetera.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.060]   As long as you're not a populist, populists are never moderate.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.720]   Okay.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.420]   But if you love corporations and corporate tax cuts and everything
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.340]   in favor of corporations, you're magically called a moderate when
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.380]   you actually, according to the polling have super extreme positions
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.220]   that the American people hate.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.460]   And by the way, that's part of the reason for the rise of
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.020]   Trump and come back to that.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.580]   Okay.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.100]   But the second shell game is taking out capitalism, putting
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.380]   in corporatism, but still calling it capitalism.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.200]   Okay.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.060]   So what is corporatism?
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.540]   It is when a corporation slowly take over the system and create
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.540]   monopoly and oligopoly power.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.340]   So that snuffs out equality of opportunity.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.980]   So how do they do that?
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.700]   Uh, when people say the, the system is rigged, they oftentimes
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.940]   can't explain it that well.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.780]   And then mainstream media goes, Oh, you sound conspiratorial rigged.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.300]   I wonder how, yeah, super easy to explain it.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.420]   Here's one of dozens of examples, carried interest loophole.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.580]   So that is for hedge funds, private equity, the, the top people on wall street.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.580]   They that's part of their income.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.980]   They get two and 20, right?
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.860]   So 2% is a flat fee, no matter what happens to the fund.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.620]   And 20% of the profits of the fund goes back to the people who invested it.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.700]   It's not their money.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.420]   It's not their investment.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.700]   Uh, what they're getting is actually just income and should
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.940]   be taxed at the highest rate.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.500]   But it's because of this loophole it's taxed at a much lower rate at around 20%.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:18.340]   So do you know at what income level you go above 20%, if you're a regular Joe,
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.700]   it's at $84,000 a year.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:27.580]   So these billionaires are getting the same tax rate as people making $84,000 a year.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.300]   It's unbelievably unfair.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.860]   Uh, and that's corporatism taking over and starting to rig the rules.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.060]   I'm going to pay less taxes.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.620]   You're going to pay more taxes.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.180]   Okay.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.980]   So again, I can give you dozens of those examples.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.860]   So, and mergers so that they get to oligopoly power.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.780]   That's how you rig a system, lowering the corporate tax rates, making sure that
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.980]   there is no real minimum wage, making sure there's no universal healthcare.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.700]   We all get become indentured servants of corporations.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.020]   They take away power from the average guy, give it to the most
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.420]   powerful people in the world.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.300]   So, and, but the most important distinction Lex is that
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.620]   corporatism hates competition.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:12.300]   It wants monopoly and oligopoly power, whereas capitalism loves
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.500]   competition and wants to free markets.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.180]   And I remember, uh, you know, we started young Turks back in 2002.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.260]   So we've been around for 22 years, longest running daily show on the internet ever.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.780]   Uh, and so we were pre Iraq war and Iraq war stars and Dick Cheney
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.620]   starts handing out no bid contracts.
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.820]   I'm like, what part of capitalism is a no bid contract?
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.020]   You can't negotiate drug prices.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.540]   The most anti free market thing I have ever heard.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.980]   It's almost like communism for corporations.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.900]   They get everything you there and there you get nothing.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.420]   Right.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.700]   So it's, it's preposterous.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.660]   It's awful.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.620]   And, and it kills the free markets and it's killing this country.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.860]   And it is the main ideology and religion of the establishment.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.340]   Are all companies built the same here?
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.900]   So when you say corporatism, uh, it seems like just looking here at the
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:17.620]   list of, uh, by industry, uh, lobbyists, it seems like there are certain
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.420]   industries that are worse offenders than others, like pharmaceuticals,
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.300]   uh, like insurance, oil and gas.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.340]   So it seems to me, uh, it feels wrong to just throw all companies
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.140]   into the same bucket of like, they're all guilty.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.100]   No, they're not all guilty.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.500]   So let's make a bunch of distinctions here.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.820]   So first of all, uh, can you, first of all, are they quote unquote guilty?
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.820]   No, they're doing something that is logical and natural, right?
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.420]   So if you're a company, do you want to pay higher taxes or lower taxes?
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.860]   Of course you want to pay lower taxes, right?
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.780]   Do you want to have higher employee costs or lower employee costs?
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.220]   Of course you want lower employee costs.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:56.540]   Right.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:03.940]   So, but the government needs to understand that and protect us from that power that
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.420]   they are going to exercise to get to those results.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.820]   And if you, if you think free markets is there is no government, you, you read it
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.100]   wrong, go, read, go back and reread Adam Smith.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.020]   He says, you must protect against monopoly power.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.940]   If you do not protect against monopoly power, you will have no free
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.100]   markets and he's absolutely right.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.780]   So second distinction is between small business and big business.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.820]   That's why Republicans will always be like, oh, we're
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.220]   doing this for small business.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.860]   That's why we got the biggest oil companies in the world.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.620]   $30 billion in subsidies.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.020]   What happened to small business?
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.420]   Right.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.220]   So I run a small business.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:46.860]   And so if people were to say like, Hey, uh, maybe there should be
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.860]   exemptions for some of the regulations.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.420]   If your company has less than five employees, 10 employees, 50 employees,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.100]   et cetera, there's some logic in that because businesses have different
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.180]   stages of growth and they have different interests and different
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.540]   needs in those stages of growth.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.620]   And we want to facilitate small business growth because
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.900]   that's great for the economy.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.140]   That's great for, uh, markets, freedom, et cetera.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.620]   But the bigger corporations, even there, there's a third distinction.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.980]   It isn't that there are certain industries that are worse.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.460]   There's just that there are industries that are better at lobbying.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.900]   So anyone who like right now, number one donor in Washington, a
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.060]   lot of people make a mistake.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.900]   They think it's APAC or they think it's the oil companies or the banks.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.380]   No, it's big pharma.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.100]   Okay.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.620]   And who has the most power in this country?
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.740]   Big pharma.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.140]   So we can't even negotiate the drug prices.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.260]   I mean, look guys, think about it this way.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.300]   That's like saying, okay, here's a bottle of water.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.740]   And normally in the free market, that would cost about a dollar.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.140]   Right.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.220]   And in the, uh, for Medicare, the drug companies come in and go, no, I'm
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.540]   not charging a dollar for that water.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.660]   I'm charging a hundred dollars.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.780]   And the government has to say, yes, sir.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.340]   Thank you, sir.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.980]   Of course, sir, we'll pay a hundred dollars.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.140]   That's that's, that's why compared to communism, because I can't
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.060]   imagine anything more diametrically opposed to the free market.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.180]   You, the consumer have to pay whatever the hell a corporation charges.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.820]   That's insanity, let alone the patents, let alone the fact that the American
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.420]   people pay for the research and then they make billions of dollars off of it.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.340]   And we get nothing but robbed by them.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.060]   So it's about lobby power.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.020]   Oil companies have huge lobby power.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.540]   Defense contractors have huge lobby power.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.460]   It's not that they're more evil.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.740]   It's just that they have figured out the game better.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.140]   And they have basically taken the influence they need to capture
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.860]   the market, capture the government and, and snuff out all competition.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.100]   Well, uh, figured out the game better.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.620]   So I think a lot of companies are good at winning the right way by
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.620]   building better products, by, um, you know, making people happier with
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.020]   the work that they're doing and winning at the game of capitalism.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.580]   And then there's other companies that win at the game of lobbying.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.900]   And I just want to sort of draw that distinction because I think it's
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.660]   a small subset of companies that are playing the game of lobbying.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.860]   It's like big pharma.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.620]   So Lex, I, first of all, you have to set rules for what makes sense.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.980]   Not, Oh, I don't like this industry.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.820]   I don't like this company or, Hey, this company is not doing
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.300]   that much lobbying at this point.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.540]   They will later when they realize what's going on.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.780]   So for example, in my opinion, APAC has totally bought almost all of Congress.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:34.020]   And so now other countries are going to wake up and go, wait, you could
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.420]   just buy the American government.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.340]   So APAC is going to spend about a hundred million dollars in this cycle.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.620]   And they're going to, and then they're getting 26 billion back.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.260]   So every country in the world is soon going to realize, Oh, take
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.500]   American citizens that live there, get them a tremendous amount of money
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.140]   and just buy the U S government.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.620]   Right.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.900]   So that, but for corporations, they've already realized
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.020]   that on a massive scale, right?
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.100]   So for example, in the two industries, you gave automotive.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.540]   So in New Jersey, about a decade ago or so, one of the most
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.260]   powerful lobbies is, uh, car dealerships.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.940]   So at the national level, you got pharma and you've got
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.060]   defense contractors, et cetera.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.060]   At the local level, guys who have huge power, number one is utilities.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.700]   Number two is real estate.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.060]   And then car dealerships are hilariously among the top, right?
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.780]   Because it's local businesses that are, you know, financing the
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.140]   politicians at the local level.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.700]   So they passed a law, uh, saying that, uh, you have to
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.540]   sell through dealerships, but Tesla doesn't sell through dealerships.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.220]   And it was intended to bully, intimidate, and push out
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.700]   Tesla out of the market.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.100]   They then did that in a number of different states
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.940]   throughout the country.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.020]   So does that make any sense in a democracy?
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.660]   Of course not.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.020]   Why you could, why do you have to sell your product through
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.580]   a specific vehicle or medium?
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.280]   You can sell it any way you like.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.420]   That's the most anti free market thing possible.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.220]   Why it was just total utter corruption.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.660]   And, but it's not, but it's perfectly legal.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.820]   The Supreme court legalized bribery.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.460]   So then what happened in that case?
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:10.980]   So then Elon came in and gave campaign contributions and reversed it.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.460]   So now we're in a battle where it's an open auction, right?
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.860]   Different companies are buying different politicians and then
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.980]   they're pretending to have debates about principles and ideas, et cetera.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.380]   So now let's look at tech.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.940]   Um, in the beginning, Facebook was not spending any money in policy
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.540]   or almost any money in politics.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.060]   So what happens?
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.780]   They're getting hammered.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.060]   They get pulled into congressional hearings and Facebook's got fake
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.540]   news and oh my God, all these trouble from Facebook, then
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.160]   Facebook does the logical thing.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.700]   Oh, it turns out I need to grease these sons of bitches.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.300]   Okay.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.380]   So then they hire a whole bunch of Republicans consultants.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.340]   They go grease all the Republicans and most of the corporate Democrats.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.740]   And then all of a sudden we're no longer talking about Facebook
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.620]   at all, and Facebook are angels.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.860]   And now we've turned our attention to who Facebook's top competitor.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.500]   Tick-tock funny how that works.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.740]   Okay.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.620]   And by the way, then Donald Trump goes, oh, I, and Tick-Tock's big dangerous
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.620]   company, they're working with China.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.240]   Okay.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.900]   And then Jeff Yass comes in on this cycle, part owner of Tick-Tock
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.860]   and he doesn't want Tick-Tock banished, of course.
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.380]   Right.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.660]   So he gives Trump a couple of million dollars.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.860]   Trump turns around the next day and goes, we love Tick-Tock.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.260]   Tick-Tock's a good company.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.960]   Right.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.420]   So that's a big contributor to, uh, influencing what politicians
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.940]   say and what they think, but it's not the entire thing, right?
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.500]   No, it is.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.580]   It's 98%.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.780]   I'll go on mainstream media and they'll be like, oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.020]   I can see how that influences politicians about 10%.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.740]   I'm like, no, no, it's 98%.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.860]   So, and even 50, a lot of good people think it's 50, 50, they
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.540]   have principles and they have money.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.540]   No, they have money and this major principles.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.500]   That's why I wanted to clarify 98 too.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.100]   Okay.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.740]   So how do we, how do we fix it?
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.820]   So it's really interesting and nice that you're pro
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.820]   capitalism and anti-corporatism.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:12.540]   So how do we create a system where the free market can rule or capitalism
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.260]   can rule, we can have these vibrant flourishing of all these companies
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.340]   competing against each other and creating awesome stuff.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.380]   So in the book, I call it democratic capitalism as opposed to
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.060]   Bernie's democratic socialism, right?
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.300]   We can get into that distinction in a minute, but.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:34.740]   Um, so as Adam Smith said, and anyone who studies, uh, capitalism
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.020]   knows you need the government to protect the market as well as the
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.940]   people, because so like, why do we have cops?
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.380]   Because if we don't have cops, somebody is going to go, well, I
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.420]   like Lex's equipment, why don't I just go into his house and take it?
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.200]   Right.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.700]   So you need the cops to protect you and that's the government.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.940]   So people say, oh, I hate big government.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.340]   Do you, right?
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.180]   It depends, right?
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.180]   If your house is getting robbed, all of a sudden you like the government.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.820]   But you also need comps on wall street, because if you allow
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.620]   insider trading, the powerful are going to rob you blind and the
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.800]   little guy's going to get screwed.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.500]   So that's this easy example.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.860]   And so if you don't have those cops, the bad guys are going to take over.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.700]   They're going to set the rules, rig the rules in their favor.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.820]   So that that's why you need regulation.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.100]   And so the Republicans on purpose made regulation a dirty word.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.780]   They're like, oh, we're all regulation is bad.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.740]   And, and then sometimes on the left, people fall for the
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.560]   trap of all regulation is good.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.180]   A guy I liken on has a great analogy on this Matt Stoller.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.340]   He's one of the original, I would argue progressives.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.220]   And there's about four of us.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.900]   I'm sure there's more, but that have stayed true to the original
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.300]   meaning of progressivism and populism.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   Me, Matt Stoller, David Sirota, Ryan Grimm.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.200]   Okay.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.180]   And they used to be in that original blogger group, there
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.340]   was guys like Glenn Greenwald and other interesting cats, right.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.740]   But they went in different directions.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.740]   So Matt has a great line.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.220]   He says, um, if somebody comes up to you and says,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.980]   how big a pipe do you want?
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.780]   There is no answer for that.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.980]   It depends on the job.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.380]   Doesn't it, right?
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.540]   What are we doing?
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.420]   What are we building?
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.340]   I, I'm going to tell you the size of the pipe
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.060]   depending on the project.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.220]   So when people say, are you in favor of regulation or against it?
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.700]   That's an absurd question.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.180]   Of course you need regulation.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.660]   It just means laws, right?
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.060]   So don't kill your neighbor is a regulation, right?
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.620]   So, uh, my idea is a simple one.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.780]   And one, we're going to keep coming back to balance.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:42.420]   So when my dad was a small business owner in New Jersey, uh, and they inspected
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.580]   the elevator six times a year, that was over regulation.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.860]   And I said to my dad, so should they not inspected at all?
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.020]   I'm a young kid growing up.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.540]   And he said, no, no, no, no.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.140]   You got to inspect it at least twice a year.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.020]   I said, why?
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.900]   He said, because in Turkey, sometimes they don't inspect it
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.140]   and then the elevator falls.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:58.920]   Okay.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:04.260]   So, so bounds are reason correct regulation to protect the markets
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.620]   and to protect the American people.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.540]   But finding the right level of regulation, especially in, for example, in tech,
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.500]   something I'm much more familiar with, it's very difficult because, uh, people
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:20.580]   in Congress are living in the 20th century before the internet was, uh, uh, invented.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.900]   So like, how are they supposed to come up with regulations?
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.900]   Well, that's the idea of the free market is you should be able to sort
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   of compete the market regulates.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.660]   And then the government can step in and protect, uh, the market from forming
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.900]   monopolies, for example, which is easier to do.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.380]   But that's a form of regulation.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:38.660]   Right.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.980]   But then there's like more checking the elevator twice a year.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.020]   That's a more sort of specific watching micromanaging.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.060]   So Lex, here's the deal.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:53.060]   There is no way around the, the laws are made by politicians.
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:53.700]   Okay.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:59.980]   So, and so you can't give up then and go, oh, it's a bunch of schmucks who I
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.300]   think most politicians are just servants for the donor class, right?
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.220]   The, you know, the media makes it sound like they're the best of us.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.820]   Oh, they deserve a lot of honor and respect and they kiss their ass, et cetera.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.820]   I think generally speaking, they're usually the worst of us, especially in
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.420]   this corporate structure, right?
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.380]   Because they're the guys who, uh, their number one talent is yes, sir.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.140]   No, sir.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.740]   What would you like me to do with your donor money, sir?
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.380]   Absolutely.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.020]   I'll serve you completely or 98%.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.660]   Right.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.940]   So in this structure, the politicians are the worst of us, but at some point
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.060]   you need somebody elected to be your representative to do democratic
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.700]   capitalism so that you have capitalism, but it's checked by the
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.620]   government on behalf of the people.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.100]   It's the people that are saying, these are the rules of the land
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.980]   and, and you have to abide by them.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:54.060]   So the, how do you get to the best possible answer, which is related
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.420]   to an earlier question you asked Lex, which is the number one thing you
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:03.500]   have to do is get big money out of politics, everything else is near
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.460]   impossible as long as we are drowned in money and whoever has more money wins.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.300]   And by the way, when it comes to legislation, again, that's
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.980]   true about 98% of the time.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.620]   Like we predict things ahead of time.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.020]   People were like, wow, how did you know that that bill wasn't
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.260]   going to pass or was going to pass?
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.100]   It's the easiest thing in the world.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.700]   And we like literally like teach our audience on the young Turks, watch,
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.260]   you'll be able to see for yourself.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.860]   And now like our members comment in, they do these predictions.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.000]   They're almost always right.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.420]   Right.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.460]   Because it's so simple, follow the money.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.460]   So if you get big money out of politics and I can explain how to do that in a
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:44.100]   sec, um, then you're at a place where you got your best shot at honest
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.700]   representatives that are going to try their best to get to the right answer.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.540]   Are they going to get to the right answer out of the gate?
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.500]   Usually not.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.020]   So they pass a law.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.220]   There's something wrong with the law.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.820]   They then fix that part.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.060]   They it's a pendulum, you know, you don't want it to swing too wildly, but
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.620]   you do need a little bit of oscillation in that pendulum to get to the right.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:07.620]   By the way, I was, uh, listening to, uh, Joe Biden from when he
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.140]   was like 30 years old, the speeches, he was eloquent as hell.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.500]   It's fun to listen to actually.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.300]   And he has a speech he gives, or just maybe a conversation in Congress.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.900]   I'm not sure where, where he talks about how corrupt the whole system is.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.940]   And he, and he's really honest and like fun.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.300]   And, uh, that Joe Biden is great, by the way, that guy, I mean, age, age sucks,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.540]   you know, people get older, but he was talking quite honestly about like having
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.980]   to suck up to all these rich people and that he couldn't really suck up to the
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:46.100]   really rich people, uh, uh, they said, uh, come back to us 10 years later when
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.060]   you're like more, more integrated into the system, but he was really honest about it.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.540]   And he's saying that's, um, that's how it is.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.620]   That's what we have to do.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.500]   And that really sucks that that's what we have to do.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:03.180]   So we did a video on our TikTok channel then and now Joe Biden, this is
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.900]   when I was trying to push Biden out.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.580]   We should say you're one of the people early on saying Biden needs to step down.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.860]   I started about a year ago because I was positive that Biden
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.300]   had a 0% chance of winning.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.780]   And, uh, and it turned out, by the way, uh, two days before he dropped
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.940]   out, his inside advisors inside the white house said, yeah,
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.380]   near 0% chance of winning.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.780]   So we were right all along.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.940]   You got a lot of criticism for that, by the way, but yeah.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.540]   Well, we can come back to that.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.060]   Yes, I did.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.100]   And which makes it Tuesday for me.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.780]   Uh, I get a lot of criticism for everything.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.220]   Uh, and by the way, democratic party, you're welcome.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.420]   Uh, so, but, uh, Biden's a really interesting example.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.380]   I'm really glad you brought it up.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.980]   So the video on TikTok was just showing Biden then Biden now.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.780]   And you're right.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.100]   Biden was so dynamic.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.180]   When you see how dynamic he was, we did like side by side.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.500]   Right.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.580]   And then you see him now going, you're barely finishing anyways.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.140]   Right.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.580]   You're like, oh, that's not the same guy.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.020]   I get it.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.540]   Right.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.220]   So, and I got like 5 million views because it resonates.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.780]   They're like, yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.060]   Right.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.620]   But when he first started to the point you were making Lex, he
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.940]   want to, in fact, I know, cause I talked to him about this.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.700]   Uh, his very first bill was anti-corruption.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.620]   Why?
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.660]   Cause at that point, everything changes in 1976 to 78 is Supreme
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.860]   court decisions that basically legalized bribery, but remember
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.820]   Biden is ancient, so he's coming into politics at a time when
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.900]   money has not yet drowned politics.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.060]   And in fact, the American population is super pissed about
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.540]   the fact that it's begun.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.060]   They don't like corruption.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:43.180]   So early Biden, because he's reading the room is very anti-corruption.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.140]   And the first bill he proposes to get money out of politics.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.740]   Okay.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:52.820]   But as Biden goes on for his epic 200 year career in Washington, he
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.660]   starts to get not more conservative, more corporate because he's
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.300]   just taking more and more money by the middle of his career.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.420]   He has a nickname, the Senator from MBNA.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.580]   Okay.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.940]   MBNA was a credit card company based in Delaware.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.180]   And the reason he had that nickname is because there isn't anything
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.740]   Joe Biden wouldn't have done for credit card companies and corporations
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.060]   based in Delaware, which are almost all corporations.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.620]   Okay.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:23.460]   So he became the most corporate Senator in the country and hence
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.340]   the most beloved by corporate media and corporate media has protected him
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.820]   his entire career until about a month ago.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.700]   So for example, in the primaries, both in 2020 and 2024, if you said
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.460]   the Senator from MBNA, I guarantee you almost no one in the audience
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.580]   has heard of it, if you heard of it, good job, you know, politics really well.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.140]   Okay.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.420]   But the reason you didn't hear of it is because the mainstream media
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.380]   wouldn't say that's outrageous of Joe Biden to be such a corporate stooge.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.740]   They'd say, that's outrageous of you to point out something that's true
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.820]   and something we reported on earlier.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.540]   Okay.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.980]   And so they protected him at all costs.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:05.460]   Now, finally, when you get to this version of Joe Biden, we, he can't talk.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.540]   He can't walk.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:11.820]   He's he bears no resemblance to the young guy who came in saying
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.380]   that money in politics was a problem.
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.180]   Now he's saying money in politics is the solution.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.700]   And in 2020, he said, well, I can raise more money than Bernie.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.820]   I can kiss corporate ass better than Bernie.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.300]   I'm the biggest corporate ass kisser in the world.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.180]   So I'm going to raise a billion dollars and you need to support me.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.180]   Now, of course he doesn't say it in those words, but that was the
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.100]   message to the establishment and Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Obama, Clyburn,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.300]   everybody goes, Oh, that's right.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.260]   Oh, Biden, Biden, Biden, Biden, not Bernie.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   I don't know that there's anybody in the country who instinctually
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.220]   dislikes Bernie more than Barack Obama.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.420]   Oh, that's an interesting, I'm not taking attention at this moment.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.300]   Let's because you mentioned mainstream media.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.740]   What's the motivation for mainstream media to be corporatist also.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.180]   So first of all, they're giant corporations.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.940]   So they're all multi-billion dollar corporations.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.460]   In the old days, we had an incredible number of media outlets.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.220]   So you go to San Francisco, there'd be at least two papers
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.740]   and there'd be a paper boy.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.420]   I'm going all the way back, paper boy on each corner.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.700]   And they're competing with one another.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.100]   Literally they'd be catty corner.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.500]   Right.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.540]   And one guy's going, Oh, I hear all this details.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.100]   They're trying to get an audience.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.860]   They're trying to get people interested.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.860]   So they're populist.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.740]   They're interesting.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.820]   They're muckrakers.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.100]   They're challenging the government.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:34.500]   Fast forward to now or not now, but about a decade ago, five years
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.540]   ago in that ballpark, in that ballpark.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:41.420]   Now there's only six giant core media corporations left and it's an oligopoly.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:41.980]   Right.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.940]   And they're all multi-billion dollar corporations.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.820]   They all want tax cuts.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.220]   Half of them are also, especially about 20 years ago during the Iraq war,
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.700]   half of them are defense contractors.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:56.500]   So they're just using the news as marketing to start wars like the Iraq war.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.220]   And then GE, which owned MSNBC makes a tremendous amount of money.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.420]   So much more money from war than it does for media.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.100]   That media is a good marketing spend for these corporations.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:14.420]   Now that's part of it that they themselves want the same exact thing as corporate,
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.540]   the rest of corporations do for corporate rule, lower tax cuts, deregulation
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.180]   so they can merge, et cetera.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.100]   But the second part of it is arguably even more important.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.820]   So where does all that money in politics go?
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.020]   So for example, in 2022, it's just a midterm election.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.660]   Not no presidential should be lower spending.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.740]   A ridiculous $17 billion are spent.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.460]   Okay.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.820]   On, on the election cycle, where does the 17 billion go?
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.340]   Almost all of it goes into corporate media, mainstream media,
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.820]   television, newspapers, radio.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.860]   They're buying ads like nuts.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.180]   So we have a reporter at TYT, David Schuster.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.660]   He used to work at MSNBC, Fox news, et cetera.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.060]   And David once did a piece about money and politics at a local NBC
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:07.460]   news station and his, uh, editor or GM spiked a story and David goes
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.540]   into his office and asked him.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.500]   So why this story is true.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.220]   It's a huge part of politics.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.780]   If we're going to report on this issue, we got to tell
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.780]   you what's actually happening.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.380]   So he says, David, come here.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.860]   It puts his arm around his shoulders, takes him to the big newsroom.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.100]   And he goes, you see all this money in politics paid for that.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.460]   That's really fascinating.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.740]   So big corporations are giving money to politicians, to different channels.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.900]   And then the politicians are spending that money on mainstream media.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:45.380]   And, and, and so there's a, there's a vicious cycle where it's in the
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.460]   interest of the mainstream media, not to criticize the very corporations
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.020]   that are feeding that cycle.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.100]   So that actually direct, it's not like corporations are, cause I was thinking
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:59.620]   one of the ways is direct advertisement, like pharmaceuticals, obviously
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:05.060]   advertise a lot on a mainstream media, but there's also indirect, which is
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.780]   like giving the politicians money or, or, or super PACs and the super
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.140]   PACs and spend money on the.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.420]   That's why media never mainstream media never talks about the number
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.300]   one factor in politics, which is money.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.820]   Like we all know, I mean, you, now we, as we talked about earlier, we
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.740]   see it with our own eyes, open auction, any country, any company, anybody
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.300]   that has money, the politicians will now literally say, I am now working
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.700]   for this guy as Trump says, cause he gave me a strong endorsement,
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   which means a lot of money.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.380]   Right.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.540]   And so, and the press never covers it almost never.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:39.980]   Right.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.860]   So you're telling me you're doing a, uh, an article on the infrastructure
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.100]   build or build back better, et cetera.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.100]   And you're not going to mention the enormous amount of money that
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.940]   every lobbyist spent on that bill.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.980]   That's absurd.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.940]   That's absurd.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.540]   That's 98% of the ball game.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.740]   And the reason they hide the ball is because they don't want you to know
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.300]   this whole thing is based on the money that they are receiving.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.580]   And, and by the way, that one more thing about that, Lex, it's
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:15.980]   that the ads themselves, actually they work and they work pretty well, but
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.100]   that's not the main reason you spend money on ads, you spend the money
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.460]   in ads to get friendly coverage from the content, from the free media that
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.980]   you're getting from that same outlet.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:33.260]   And so since every newspaper and every news television station and network
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.420]   knows that the democratic party and the Republican party are their top clients.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.700]   They're going to get billions of dollars from them.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.020]   They never really criticized the Republican and Democratic party.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.260]   On the other hand, if you're an outsider, they'll rip your face off.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.420]   That's also really interesting.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.780]   So if you're an advertiser, if you're big farmer and you're advertising, it's
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:01.460]   not that the advertisement works is that the hosts are too afraid, not like
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.660]   explicitly, just even implicitly, they're self-censoring, they're not going to
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:10.420]   have any guests that are like controversial, anti big pharma, or they're
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.340]   not going to make any jokes about big pharma.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.620]   They're not going to make that.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.420]   And that, and that kind of, that continues and expands.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.060]   That's really interesting.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.620]   Sometimes it's super direct.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:25.900]   When I was a host on MSNBC, I had a company that I was criticizing
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.340]   in my script and management looked at it.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.860]   And by the way, I used to go off prompter a lot and it drove him crazy.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.420]   Not because I wasn't good at it.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.820]   I think my ratings went up whenever I went off prompter, but because
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.820]   they couldn't pre-approve the script.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.020]   And what do they want to pre-approve?
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.820]   Hey, are you going to criticize one of our sponsors, one
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.300]   of our advertisers, et cetera?
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.300]   So they, uh, we had a giant fight over it and the compromise was I
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.860]   moved them lower in the script, but kept them in the story, right?
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.660]   So sometimes it's super direct like that, but more, way more
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.300]   often it's implicit, it's indirect.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.100]   You don't have to say it right.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.300]   So I give you a spectacular example of it so that you get a
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.060]   sense of how it works implicitly.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.620]   So since GE is a giant defense contractor, they own MSNBC
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.940]   at the time of the Iraq war.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.740]   They fired everyone who was against the Iraq war on air.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:24.300]   So Phil Donahue, Jesse Ventura, Ashley Banfield, but Ashley Banfield,
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.820]   they did something different with, okay.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.500]   She was a rising star at the time.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.540]   She goes and gives a speech in Kansas, not really even
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.460]   having a policy position, but just talking about the actual
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.340]   costs of this Iraq war and how we should be really careful.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.980]   They hate that.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.740]   So they take their rising star and they take her off air.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.380]   Okay.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.580]   And she goes, okay, good.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.580]   Let me out of my contract.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:46.940]   It's okay.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.740]   I'll go because she was such a star at that time.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.900]   She could have easily gotten somewhere else and they go, no, we're not
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.060]   going to let you out of your contract.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.540]   Why not?
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.860]   You're going to pay me to do nothing?
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.220]   Not only that, we're moving your office.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.140]   Where are you moving it to?
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.420]   They literally moved it into a closet.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.540]   Okay.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:07.620]   And they made sure that everybody in the building saw her getting taken
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.940]   off the air and moved into a closet.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.460]   The closet is the memo, right?
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.240]   That's the memo to the whole building.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.940]   You better shut up and do as you're told.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.820]   Okay.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:21.660]   So that way I don't have to tell you and get myself in trouble.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.700]   It's super obvious.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.300]   There are guardrails here and you are not allowed to go beyond acceptable thought.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.060]   And acceptable thought is our sponsors are great.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.220]   Politicians are great.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.500]   The powerful are great.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.660]   So how do we, uh, how do we begin to fix that?
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.020]   And what exactly are we fixing?
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.580]   Is that, uh, the influence of the lobbyists, the influence of like, it
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:47.060]   feels like there's, uh, companies have found different ways to achieve influence.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.460]   Right.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.100]   So how do we get money out of politics?
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.140]   So it's very difficult, but doable and we will do it.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.500]   So, but in order to do it, the populist left and the populist right have to
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.460]   unite because, and by the way, that is why we have the culture wars.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.580]   That's why you're voting for Trump.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.060]   No chance.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.620]   Okay.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.900]   So we can get into that in a minute.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.700]   So the culture wars are meant to divide us.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.620]   If we, if we get united, we have enough leverage and power to be able to do it,
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:18.260]   but, uh, you can't do it through a normal bill because if you do it in a bill, the
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.900]   whole point of capturing the Supreme court was to make sure that they kill any piece
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.900]   of legislation that would protect the American people.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   You're saying the Supreme court is also captured by this?
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.740]   Oh, a hundred percent.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.180]   So, okay.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.140]   So let me explain again, people for the uninitiated, they think,
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.620]   oh, that sounds conspiratorial.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.260]   Well, in this case, that's actually somewhat true because people
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.740]   now know about this.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.900]   It's the Powell memo, right?
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.260]   The most infamous political memo in history.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.860]   Lewis Powell writes a memo for the chamber of commerce in 1971.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.820]   That's basically a blueprint for how the chamber of commerce
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.980]   can take over the government.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.140]   And Lewis Powell explains one of the most important things you have
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.980]   to do is take over the media.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.940]   But even more important than that is taking over the Supreme court
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.380]   because the Supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of what
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.820]   is allowed and not allowed.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:13.380]   And he says, we need quote, activist judges to, to help
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.700]   business interests on the court.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.420]   Okay.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.620]   And then Nixon reads the memo and goes, that sounds like a really good idea.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.460]   How about I put you on the Supreme court?
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:26.140]   And he puts Lewis Powell, the guy who wrote the memo on the Supreme court,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:31.180]   where he's the deciding vote in Belotti and, uh, and, uh, Buckley.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.140]   So a lot of these, uh, those two decisions are 76 to 78.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.340]   And what they say is yeah.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:37.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.980]   I read the constitution and it says that money is speech.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.420]   No, it isn't.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.900]   And no, it didn't.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.500]   That's not even close to true.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.220]   They just made it up and they said, okay.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.700]   And corporations, they're human beings.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.940]   No, they're not.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.180]   That's preposterous.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:53.580]   Right.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.380]   And they have the same inalienable rights as human beings and citizens do.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.900]   And money is speech and speech is an inalienable right.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.940]   So corporations can spend unlimited money in politics.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.820]   And there goes our democracy gone.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.580]   Okay.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.940]   So citizens United just shot a dead horse with a Gatling gun and made it
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.140]   worse and put it on steroids, but it was already dead in 78.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.580]   So that's why every chart you see for the rest of your life, you'll see this,
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:28.500]   um, every chart and about the American economy starts to diverge in 1978.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:34.260]   So until 38 to 78, we have golden 40 years of economic prosperity.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.820]   We create the greatest middle-class the world has ever seen.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.740]   And, uh, our productivity is sky high, but our
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.860]   wages match our productivity.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:50.220]   After 78 productivity is still sky high best in the world.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:50.500]   Okay.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.300]   Sometimes people, all the American workers, lazy, not remotely true.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.380]   We work our ass off.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:55.940]   Okay.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:01.380]   But wages flatline and they've been flatlining for about 50 years straight.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.700]   And the reason is because the Supreme court made bribery legal.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.540]   So in order to get past the Supreme court, you only have
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.420]   one choice, that's an amendment.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.620]   And so you have to get an amendment.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:17.660]   Amendments are very difficult, but so for example, you, you need two thirds
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.140]   of Congress to even propose the amendment.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.980]   So, well, why would Congress propose an amendment that would
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.140]   take away their own power?
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:25.620]   Right.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.700]   Cause almost everybody in Congress got there through corruption.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.300]   Their main talent is I can kiss corporate ass better than you can.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:32.900]   Right.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.380]   So I, they take the most amount of a person with more money in
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.220]   Congress wins 95% of the time.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:38.820]   Right.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.180]   But the good news is the founding fathers were geniuses and
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.380]   they put in a second outlet.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.940]   They said, or two thirds of the States can call for a convention
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.780]   where you can propose an amendment.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.260]   And after an amendment is proposed, then three quarters
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.620]   of the States have to ratify it.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.380]   That's what makes it so difficult because getting three quarters of
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.100]   the States, there's so many red States, so many blue States getting
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.540]   three quarters of the States to agree is near impossible, but there is one
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.140]   issue that the whole country agrees on.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:13.060]   93% of Americans believe that politicians serve their donors and not their voters.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.460]   So this is the one thing we can unite on.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.220]   If we unite on this, we push our States to call for a convention.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.020]   We all go to the convention together.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:26.100]   We bring democracy alive and we propose amendments to the constitution.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.700]   Um, the best amendment gets three quarters of the States to ratify.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.060]   You go above the Supreme court and you solve the whole thing.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:39.020]   So if 93% of people want this, why hasn't it happened yet?
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.620]   I mean, the obvious answer is there's a corporate control of
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.060]   the media and the politicians, but it seems like our current system.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:52.340]   And the megaphone that a president has, you should be able to kind
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.420]   of unite the populace left and right.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.420]   So it shouldn't be that difficult to do.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:01.380]   Like, why hasn't a person like Trump was a billionaire or on the left,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:05.700]   um, a rich businessman run just on this and win.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.620]   Well, eventually they will.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.260]   Right.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.780]   And so that's why I actually have a lot of hope, even though
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.500]   things seem super dark right now.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.300]   So, uh, and that's why I was for Bernie.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.780]   So I'll get, I can come back to that.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.980]   But why hasn't Trump done it as easy?
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.820]   He's like, what am I a sucker?
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.220]   The guy gives me money.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.460]   I do what the guy wants.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.100]   Why would I get rid of that?
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.140]   That's how I got into power.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.700]   And so that's how I'm doing it.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.340]   Now I get, go to Miriam Edelson and say, give me a hundred million dollars and
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.940]   I'll let Israel annex the West bank.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.340]   Right.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.420]   So I'll go to the oil companies and give me a billion dollars
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.980]   and I'll give you tax subsidies.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:38.860]   I'll let you drill.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.100]   I'll take away regulation.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.020]   Why would I stop that?
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.860]   You think he likes money more than he likes being popular?
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:50.820]   Because, uh, there, there's a big part of him as a populist in the sense that like
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.700]   he loves being admired by large masses of people.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.620]   So, and you're absolutely right, but that is the fault of MAGA.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:05.140]   And so MAGA, you're screwing populists in a way that is infuriating.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:05.820]   Okay.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.940]   And smart libertarians like Dave Smith have figured this out.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.260]   And that's why he's just as mad at Trump as I am.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:19.140]   And, uh, and it's because he took a populist movement and he redirected
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.340]   it for his own personal gain, MAGA, figure it out, come on.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:23.820]   Right.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.740]   And so if you say, Oh, you think Democrats have figured out that
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.020]   these policies, no, they largely haven't figured it out either.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.740]   And I think there's blue MAGA and I could talk about that as well.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.140]   But for those of us on the populist left, yeah, we're
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.940]   not enamored by politicians.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.100]   And for example, when Bernie does the wrong thing, we call him out.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.260]   Well, I'm not, Bernie's not my goddamn uncle.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.260]   I don't, I don't like him for some personality reason.
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.580]   It's not a cult of personality.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.260]   You do the right thing.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.620]   I love you for you do the wrong thing.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.820]   I'm gonna kick your ass for it.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.180]   Right.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.980]   So, but Donald Trump does this massive, ridiculous corruption over and over
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.580]   again, and MAGA is like, I'm here for it.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.020]   Love it.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.340]   As long as you're doing the corruption, I'm okay with it.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.460]   What does Trump, what does Trump say about getting money out of politics?
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.140]   Does he, he says nothing about it.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.980]   Go ahead, MAGA.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.380]   Why haven't you held them to account?
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:10.860]   Like, so when Bernie helped Biden take out $15 minimum wage from the Senate
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:15.460]   bill on the first bill that was introduced in the Biden administration, we went nuts.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.540]   We did a petition.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.300]   We sent in videos to Bernie, our audience going, don't kill it, Bernie.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:21.940]   Don't kill it.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.140]   And so Bernie then reintroduced it as an amendment.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.620]   It got voted down, but he did the right thing, right?
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:32.180]   That is us holding our top leader accountable and saying, you
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.540]   better get back on track.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.100]   Okay.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.060]   Cause we're not here for you and your personal self and grant aggrandizement.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.620]   We're here for policy.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.020]   Right.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.060]   And if MAGA was actually here for policy, they would absolutely level
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.540]   Trump on the fact that he, I mean, remember what he ran on, drain the swamp.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.900]   That's why he won in 2016.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.220]   Right.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:56.780]   I, so I predicted on ABC right after the DNC and Hillary Clinton was up 10, 12
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.260]   points, whatever she was, and I said, Trump would win.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:49:59.980]   Okay.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.380]   And they, the whole panel laughed out loud, right?
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.740]   They're like, get a load of this crazy guy.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.780]   I said, he's a populist who seems to hate the establishment in a, in a
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:16.300]   populist time and so, and drain the swamp is, is a great, uh, slogan.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.380]   Uh, and I knew he would win when he was in a Republican debate and he
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:26.060]   said, I paid all these guys before I paid them and they did whatever I wanted.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.100]   And I was like, that's so true.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.620]   Right.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.020]   And people will love that.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.780]   And especially Republican voters will love that.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.420]   I actually have a lot of respect for Republican voters because they
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.300]   actually genuinely hate corruption.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:42.700]   So what would an amendment look like that, uh, helps prevent money
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.100]   being an influence in politics?
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:50.620]   So I started a group called Wolfpack, um, and thank you, wolf-pack.com.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.660]   And, and the reason why I named it Wolfpack is because everyone in
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.220]   Washington I knew would hate that name.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:01.740]   Um, it's a populist name and everybody in Washington snickers like, no, you're
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.340]   supposed to name it Americans for America and just trick people, et cetera.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:05.820]   No, no, no.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.180]   Wolfpack means we're coming for you.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:07.860]   Okay.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.940]   We're not coming for you in a weirdo, physical or violent way.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.940]   We're coming for you in a democratic way.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:13.580]   Okay.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.060]   So we're going to go to those state, uh, houses.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.980]   We're going to get them to propose a convention and we did it in five states,
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.260]   but then the democratic party started beating us back.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:22.940]   We'll get to that.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:29.420]   And, uh, and so, uh, we are going to overturn your apple cart and we're going
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.300]   to bring, put the American people back in charge.
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.740]   So what does the amendment say?
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.980]   Number one, uh, a lot of people will have, uh, different opinions on what it
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.220]   should say, and that's what you sort out in a convention.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.140]   So for example, one of the things that conservatives can propose, which
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:46.660]   makes sense is term limits, because with the reason why these super old
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.380]   politicians are in charge is because they provide a return on investment.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.820]   So, you know, if you give to Biden, Pelosi or McConnell,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.580]   they're going to deliver for you.
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.220]   They love that return on investment.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.620]   They don't want to risk it on a new guy.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   The new guy might have principles, ew, or, you know, might want to actually
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.180]   do a little bit for his voters, boo.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:12.740]   Whereas these old, you know, and every corrupt system has these old
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.180]   guys hanging around that help maintain power, et cetera.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:21.300]   So my particular proposal in the amendments would be a couple of things.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.900]   One is end private financing of elections.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.580]   So if, and look, if you're a business person, you're a capitalist,
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.220]   you know, this with absolute certainty.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.420]   If somebody signs your check, that's the person you work for, right?
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:40.780]   So if private interests are funding politicians, the politicians
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.740]   will serve private interests.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.300]   And then you're going to get into a fight like Elon did in New Jersey,
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.780]   where the car dealerships and Tesla are getting into an auction.
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.820]   Like, can I hear a hundred thousand?
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.780]   No, a million to 2 million, 3 million.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.020]   Right.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.500]   And then, and now you've got to go bribe the government official.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.300]   That's called a campaign contribution.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:02.660]   And this is a terrible system, right?
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:07.220]   And the private financing go to complete public financing of elections.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.140]   That's when the conservatives, because they've been propagandized
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.540]   by corporate media, yes.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.340]   Mainstream media got into your head too.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.660]   And right-wing media got into your head too.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.260]   And right-wing media also financed by a lot of this corrupt interest.
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.900]   And so they tell you, Oh, you don't want to publicly finance.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.420]   Oh my God, you'd be spending like a billion dollars on politicians.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.460]   Brother, they spending trillions of dollars of your money because
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.060]   they're financed by the guys that they're giving all of your money to.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.580]   So can you educate me?
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.060]   Does that prevent something like citizen united?
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.180]   So like super PACs are all gone in this case.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:41.820]   So all indirect funding is also indirect.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.660]   Funding's gone.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.820]   Direct funding's gone.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.940]   You have to set up some thresholds.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.700]   Not everybody can just get money to run.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.340]   You have to prove that you have some sort of a popular support.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.780]   So signature gathering, uh, you would still allow for small money
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.060]   donations, like up to a hundred dollars, something along those lines.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.060]   That's not 5,000 or whatever it is now.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.940]   Yeah, I think 5,000 is too high, but those are fine debates.
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.020]   You know, but you basically want to create an incentive.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.100]   Everything is about incentives and disincentives.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.660]   Again, capitalists realize this better than anyone else.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.020]   Right.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:18.380]   So you want to set up an incentive to serve your voters, not your donors.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.980]   So if you take away private donors, well, there goes that incentive.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.420]   And that's gigantic, right?
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.740]   And then if you set up small grassroots funding as a way to get past the
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.740]   threshold to get the funding to run an election, well then good, because
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:36.380]   then you're serving small donors, which are generally voters, right?
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.180]   So that's what you want.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.220]   And ending private financing is critical.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.260]   But the second thing is ending corporate personhood.
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:48.700]   So this is where you get into a lot of fights because of two reasons.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:54.180]   One is some folks have a principled position against it and they say, well,
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:59.140]   I mean the Sierra club is technically a corporation, ACLU is technically a
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:05.540]   corporation, and so if you end corporate personhood, then they, you know, that
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.500]   could endanger their existence, right?
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.980]   No, it doesn't endanger their existence at all.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:10.460]   Right.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.340]   So it doesn't endanger GM or GE's existence.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:14.860]   It doesn't endanger anybody's existence.
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.380]   Corporations exist.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.740]   We're not trying to take them away.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.620]   I would never do that.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:18.860]   Right.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:19.740]   That's not smart.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.820]   That's not workable, et cetera.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:25.620]   We're just saying they don't have constitutional rights.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.820]   So they have the rights that we give them.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.020]   And by the way, read the founding fathers is also in my book.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.740]   They hated corporations.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:38.900]   The American revolution was partly against the British East India company.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:43.540]   And so the tea party in Boston was against that corporation.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.500]   They threw their tea overboard.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.100]   It was not against the British monarchy.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.860]   And so they, and all the founding fathers warned us over and over
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.580]   again, watch out for corporations.
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:56.180]   Okay.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.900]   Cause once they form, they will amass money and power
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.100]   and look to kill off democracy.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.740]   And they were totally right.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.180]   That's exactly what happened.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.860]   And so it's not that you don't have them.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.700]   It's that you, through democratic capitalism, you limit their power.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.580]   They definitely, you can give them a bunch of rights.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.180]   You say, Hey, you have a right to exist.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.740]   You have a right to do this, this, and this.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.180]   Okay.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:23.660]   But you do not have constitutional rights of a, of a citizen.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:27.700]   And so you don't have the right to speak to a politician
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.220]   by giving them a billion dollars.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.740]   And you believe that the people will be able to find the right
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:38.220]   policies to regulate and tax the corporations such that
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.540]   capitalism can flourish still.
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.500]   Yes.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.180]   You know why?
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.180]   Cause I'm a real populist and I believe in the people.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:48.580]   So I drive the establishment crazy because
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.740]   they don't believe in the people.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.380]   They think, Oh, Jacob, have you seen MAGA?
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.620]   Have you seen these guys?
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.260]   Have you seen the radicals on the left?
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.340]   We're so much smarter.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.900]   Well, you know how many Ivy league degrees we have.
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.700]   Right.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.300]   And we know what we're doing.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.420]   No, you don't know.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:05.860]   You're everybody to some degree looks out
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.180]   for their own interests, right?
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.900]   Why I like capitalism and why I love democracy is
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.540]   because it's the wisdom of the crowd.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.340]   And so in the long run, the crowd is right.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.940]   Oftentimes in the short term, we're wrong.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:17.460]   Okay.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.220]   But the wisdom of the crowd in the long run is much,
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.220]   much better than the elites that run things.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.620]   The elites say, well, we're so smart and educated.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.580]   So we're going to know better.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.420]   What's good for you?
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:27.980]   No brother.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.940]   You're going to know what's better for you.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.500]   And, and, and so here's something that a lot of
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.460]   people get wrong on the populist left and right.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.940]   They think, Oh, those guys are evil.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:36.660]   They're not evil.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.620]   I've met them.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.740]   I worked at MSNBC.
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.620]   I worked on cable.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.620]   I went to Wharton, you know, Columbia law.
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.060]   It's I know a lot of those guys.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.780]   And so they're not at all evil.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.980]   They don't even know that they're mainly
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.180]   serving their own interests.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.820]   They just naturally do it.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.300]   Right.
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.380]   And so they think the carrot interest
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.340]   loophole makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.580]   They think corporate tax cuts makes a lot of
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.300]   sense, you not getting higher wages, you not
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.220]   having healthcare, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.700]   It doesn't make any goddamn sense, but they
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:06.980]   get themselves to believe it.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.020]   And that's another part portion of the
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.140]   invisible hand on the market.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.060]   So there's problems with every, every path.
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.540]   Uh, so the elite, like you mentioned, can be
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.540]   corrupted by greed, by power and so on, but
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.260]   the crowd, I agree with you, by the way, about
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.380]   the wisdom of the crowd versus the wisdom of
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.580]   the elite, but the crowd can be captured by a
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.540]   charismatic leader.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.140]   So the problem with populism, and I'm probably
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.940]   a populist myself, the problem with populism
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:35.580]   is it, it can be, and has been throughout
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.180]   history captured by bad people.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.700]   But if you say to me, trust the elites
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.820]   or trust the people, I'm going to trust the
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.340]   people every single time.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.420]   Well, that's why you're such an interesting,
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.180]   I don't want to say contradiction, but there's
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:50.900]   a tension that creates the balance.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:56.020]   So to me, in the way you're speaking, my, uh,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.980]   result in hurting capitalism.
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.700]   So it's, it's easy to infighting
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.660]   corporatism to, um, to hurt companies.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.900]   So to go too far the other way.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.580]   Yeah, of course, of course.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.340]   And so like when you talked about corporate
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.900]   tax, so what's, what's the magic, what's
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.580]   the magic number for the corporate tax?
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:19.180]   Cause if it's too high, like companies leave.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:19.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.300]   Companies have so much power right now.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.220]   This pendulum has swung so far and we're guys,
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.500]   we're almost out of time.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.660]   The window's closing.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.940]   The minute private equity buys all of our
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.540]   homes, the residential real estate market,
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.580]   we're screwed.
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.500]   We're indentured servants forever.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.180]   Okay.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:41.100]   There goes wealth creation for the average
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:41.580]   American.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.500]   So you're right.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.620]   Like this is that it's not a contradiction.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.620]   It's a tension that is inevitable to get
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.340]   to balance.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.860]   The reason why people kind of can't figure
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.940]   me out, they're like, well, you're on the
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.140]   left, but you're a capitalist, et cetera.
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.300]   That's not a contradiction.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.380]   That's getting to the right balance.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.100]   And in order to do that, like if you say,
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.940]   well, if we change the system, I'm afraid of
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.940]   change because what if the pendulum swings
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.100]   too far in the other direction, right?
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.660]   Well, then you would be opposed to change
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.580]   at all times.
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.260]   So if you do that, it actually reminds
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.940]   me of the Biden fight.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.620]   Right.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.460]   So I'm like, guys, he has, he has almost
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.340]   no chance of winning.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.900]   He stands for the establishment.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.980]   He can't talk, but then the number one
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.300]   pushback I'd get from Democrats was, yeah,
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.020]   but what if we change, it's so scary.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.900]   We don't know about Kamala Harris.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.300]   What if it's not Kamala Harris?
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.780]   It's so scary.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.700]   Don't change.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.180]   And I'm like, yeah, but if you say change
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.940]   might be worse, it also might be better.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.780]   And you're at zero.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.620]   Anything is better, right?
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.140]   And right now, in terms of corruption in
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.540]   America, we're at 98% corruption.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.300]   So we've got 2% decency left.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.860]   Brother, this is when you want change.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:07.780]   And so, and Lex, if you actually have wisdom
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.100]   of the crowd, just like in supply and demand
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.740]   and how it works in economics, it works
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.140]   the same way in a functioning democracy.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.540]   You go too far, you come back in.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.020]   So for example, when Reagan came into
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.700]   office, me and my dad, my family,
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.620]   we were Republicans.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.500]   Why?
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.820]   At that point, the highest marginal
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.500]   tax rate was at 70%.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.020]   70% is too high, right?
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.780]   Now they, then he brought it all the way
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.300]   down to 28%, that's too low, right?
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.260]   So, and, and, but, and that's how
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.540]   the, the system modulates itself.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   Already we were headed towards corruption
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.940]   and because it's the eighties now we're
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.620]   past 78, magic 78 marker, right?
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.580]   So, and, and even Carter was way more
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.340]   conserved economically than people realize
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.420]   because we're already getting past it by
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.260]   the time it's in his administration.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.900]   But the bottom line is yes, you're going,
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.580]   whenever you have real wisdom of the
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.500]   crowd, whether it's in business or in
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.620]   politics, you're going to have fluctuation.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.900]   You're going to have that pendulum
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.940]   swinging back and forth.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.700]   You don't want wild swings,
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.820]   communism, corporatism, right?
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.460]   You want to get to, Hey, where, where's
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.380]   the right balance here between capitalism
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.940]   and what people think is socialism?
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:22.100]   So I guess, uh, I agree with most of the
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.620]   things you said about the corruption.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.300]   Uh, I just wish there would be more
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.420]   celebration of the fact that capitalism
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500]   and some incredible companies in the
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.540]   history of the 20th century has created
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.860]   so much wealth, so much innovation that
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.460]   has increased the quality of life on
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.220]   average, they've also increased the
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.220]   wealth and equality and exploitation of
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.460]   the workers and this kind of stuff.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.860]   But you, you want to not forget to
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.780]   celebrate the awesomeness that companies
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.340]   have also brought outside the political
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.980]   sphere, just in creating awesome stuff.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.060]   Look, I run a company and so I don't
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.660]   want companies to go away and, and I
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.100]   don't want you to hate all companies.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.060]   I think young Turks is a wonderful
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:02.700]   company, right?
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.900]   We provide great healthcare.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.140]   We take care of our employees.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.500]   We care about the community, et cetera.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.140]   And we're building a whole nation
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:12.500]   online on, on those principles and
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.820]   the right way to run a company.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.300]   Right.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.860]   Um, but guys, we're at the
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.020]   wrong part of the pendulum.
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.340]   The companies have overwhelming
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.340]   power and they're crushing us.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.940]   We're like, uh, that scene in star
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.460]   wars where the trash compactor is
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.540]   closing in on them, the walls are closing
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.900]   in, we're almost out of time because
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.340]   they've captured the government almost
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.260]   entirely, they're only serving
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.220]   corporate interests.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.780]   We've got to get back into
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.180]   balance before it's too late.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.500]   And that's why I care so much
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.020]   about structural issues.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.660]   So I formed justice Democrats.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.460]   So that's AOC, et cetera, right?
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.900]   That's people know it as the squad.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.460]   They know it as just Democrats, et cetera.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.740]   I'm one of the co-founders of that.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.580]   And my number one rule was
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.740]   no corporate PAC money.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.820]   Okay.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.340]   So you're not allowed to take corporate
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.780]   PAC money, by the way, now Matt
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.820]   Gates and Josh Hawley have stopped
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.620]   taking corporate PAC money and they've
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.580]   become to some degree on economic
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.820]   issues, genuine populists.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.980]   It's amazing.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.180]   It happens overnight.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.580]   All of a sudden they're holding,
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.420]   they're talking about holding
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.620]   corporations accountable, et cetera.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.180]   Now just Democrats wind up
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:21.140]   having other problems.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.980]   They got too deep into social
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.620]   issues, not economic issues.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.420]   There's a general sort of criticism
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.740]   of billionaires, right?
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.660]   This idea.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.540]   Now you could say that billionaires
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.300]   are avoiding taxes and they're not
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.980]   getting taxed enough, but I think
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.780]   under that flag of criticizing
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.900]   billionaires is criticizing all.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.660]   Uh, companies that do epic
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.580]   shit that build stuff.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.700]   So create stuff that that's,
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.900]   that's what I'm worried about.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.140]   I don't hear enough like genuine.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.100]   You know, I like celebrating people.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.260]   I like celebrating ideas.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.140]   I just don't hear enough genuine
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.380]   celebration of companies when they do.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.860]   No, because, okay.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.300]   So are you right?
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.900]   Not about companies, but about capitalism.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.460]   Yes.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.020]   Because you know, you look at life
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.260]   expectancy 200 years ago and you look
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.660]   at it now and you go, wow, holy shit.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.260]   We did amazing things.
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:16.740]   Right.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.660]   So, and what happened in the last 200 years?
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.380]   We went from dictatorships more
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.220]   towards democracy, wisdom of the crowd.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.260]   We went from, you know, serfs and
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.540]   indentured servants and a nobility that
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.140]   holds the land to more towards capitalism.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.180]   And boom, the crowd is right.
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.020]   Things go really well.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.500]   The advances in medicine are amazing
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.020]   and medicine is a great example.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.260]   So, and on our show, I point all those
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.740]   things out and I say, look, we hate the
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.940]   drug companies because of how they
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.820]   capture the government.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.220]   Right.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.060]   But we don't hate the drug companies
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.300]   for creating great drugs.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.900]   That those drugs save lives.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:54.860]   They saved my life.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:56.540]   They saved countless millions
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   upon millions of lives.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.140]   So the right idea isn't shut down drug
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.700]   companies, the right idea is don't let
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:03.940]   them buy the government.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.500]   Right.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.420]   So, and, and I know we get back
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.100]   into our instinctual shells.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.260]   So on the left, there'll be, oh, we should
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.460]   get rid of all billionaires.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.100]   Why?
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.220]   Like, how does that fix the system?
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.140]   Tell me how it fixes the system.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.540]   And I'm all ears, right?
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.300]   My solution is end private financing.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.340]   Then you can be a billionaire all you
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.980]   like, you can't buy the government.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.420]   Right.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.940]   That's a more logical way to go about it.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.020]   I've never worn an eat the rich shirt
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.700]   and it drives me crazy.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.020]   I'm like, you would have eaten FDR, right?
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.820]   And FDR is the best president, most
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.500]   populous president, in my opinion.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.260]   And so, no, there's wonderful rich people.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.940]   Of course, of course, there's
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.580]   a range of humanity, right?
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.700]   But you don't want to get rid of the rich.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   You don't want to get rid of companies,
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.220]   but you also don't want to let
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.100]   them control everything.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.780]   So, okay, I'll give you an example that's
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.220]   really, and that informs a lot of how I think
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.940]   about things, which is my dad.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.900]   So my dad was a farmer in Southeastern
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.820]   Turkey, near the Syrian border.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.940]   No money, in fact, his dad died when he was
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.420]   six months old and he, and so they were
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:11.260]   saddled with debt and no electricity in his
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.820]   house, like as poor as poor gets.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.780]   And he wound up living the American dream.
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:19.820]   And so how did he do that?
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.500]   What, what made the difference?
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.300]   Uh, well, what made the difference
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.620]   is opportunity, right?
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:29.580]   So I'm a populist because my dad
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.820]   was in the masses, right?
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.300]   And, and the elites say the masses are no good.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.140]   We're smart.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.460]   You're not, we're educated.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.020]   You're not.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.300]   Uh, we, at Meritocracy, we talk about that.
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.420]   We have earned merit.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.300]   And if you're poor or middle-class, you
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.660]   have not earned merit.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.060]   Okay.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.540]   You're useless and worthless.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.380]   And I hate that.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.220]   So what did, uh, Turkey do back in the
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.180]   1960s that liberated my dad?
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.460]   They provided free college education.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.540]   You had to test into it.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.180]   Okay.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.660]   But the top 15% got a free college
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.340]   education at the best colleges in Turkey.
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.500]   So, and my uncle saved all of our lives
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.180]   when he came to my dad and said, do you
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.260]   like working on this farm?
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.540]   And my dad was like, fuck no.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.100]   Right.
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.340]   It's super hot.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.260]   It's super hard.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.660]   It's just, they got to get up at four in the
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.780]   morning, if they're lucky, the family next
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.260]   door gives them a mule.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.700]   If they're not, they got to carry
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.620]   the shit themselves.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.140]   Okay.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.420]   He's, so my uncle told him work just as hard
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.220]   in school and you'll be able to get a house,
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.340]   a car, pretty girls, et cetera.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.380]   So my dad works his ass off, gets into the
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.740]   school and he comes out a mechanical engineer
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.260]   and starts his own company.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.140]   He creates a company in Turkey,
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.420]   hires hundreds of people.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.420]   He then moves to America, creates a company
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.900]   here, hires tons of people.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.340]   Right.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.140]   So do I hate companies?
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.580]   No, my dad set up two companies and, and I
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.420]   saw how much it benefited people.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.100]   I saw how much employees would come up
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.380]   to my dad 20, 30 years later in the street
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:08:59.900]   and hug him.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.420]   And they tell me as a young kid, your dad's
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.140]   the most fair boss we ever had.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.100]   And we love him for it.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:05.500]   Right.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.900]   That's how you run a company.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.300]   And he taught me the value of hard work.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.460]   But the reason I brought up here is
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.300]   because he taught me, look, like skill and
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:19.340]   ability is a genetic lottery, so you're not
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:22.100]   going to just get the rich to win all the
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:22.900]   genetic lottery.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.860]   No, there's going to be tons of poor kids
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.580]   and middle-class kids who are just as good,
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.220]   if not better.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.340]   You have to provide them the opportunity,
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.340]   the fair chance to succeed.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.420]   You have to believe in them.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.500]   So this isn't about disempowering anyone.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.580]   It's about empowering all of those kids who
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.660]   are doing the right thing or smart and want
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.420]   to work hard so they can build their own
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.860]   companies and add to the economy.
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.820]   What in general is your view on meritocracy?
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.060]   So I love meritocracy.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.620]   I wish that we lived in a meritocracy and
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.260]   I want to drive towards living in a
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.300]   meritocracy, so that's why I don't like
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.460]   equality of results.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.260]   So, okay, now people that are on the left
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.700]   will get super mad at that and go, what
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.220]   do you mean?
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.100]   Well, okay, brother, let's say you're at
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.020]   work and you got one guy who's working his
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.500]   ass off, another guy that's going, I don't
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.900]   care, I'm not going to do it, right?
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.020]   Well, the guy who works super hard has
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:16.980]   to pick up the slack.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.020]   Now he's working twice as hard, right?
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.780]   And now you want the same results.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.340]   You want the same salary as that guy?
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.540]   No, brother.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.300]   No, he's working twice, four times,
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.340]   10 times harder than you.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.900]   That's not fair.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.220]   Fairness matters.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.460]   I lived, we wound up, I mean, this is,
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.300]   we're in the suburbs of Jersey, but we wound
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.380]   up in Freehold eventually and we lived
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:39.300]   across a farm, which is kind of, in central
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.460]   Jersey it happens, right?
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.300]   And it was called Fair Chance Farm.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.620]   I was like, how did I, this is amazing, right?
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.940]   And I love that.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.540]   That's the essence of America and that's
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.700]   what I want to go back to.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.780]   So we've got to create that opportunity
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.100]   of, not just because it's the moral thing
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.660]   to do, but because it's also the economically
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.820]   smart thing to do.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:06.020]   If you enable all those great people that
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.580]   are in lower income classes and middle
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.860]   income classes, you're going to get a much
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.260]   better economy, a much stronger democracy.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.460]   So that's the direction we go.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.060]   So again, it's about balance, but what do
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:25.300]   you think about DEI policies, say in academia
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.460]   and companies, so the movement as it has
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.820]   evolved, where's that on the balance?
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:38.140]   Is that, how far is it pushing towards
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.660]   equality of outcome versus equality of opportunity?
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:40.940]   Okay.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.860]   So now we're getting into social issues, right?
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.060]   So this is where we all rip each other apart.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.020]   And then the people at the top laugh their
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.460]   ass off at us and go, we got to fighting
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.620]   over trans issues.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   They're killing each other.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   It's hilarious.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.500]   And they're so busy.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.220]   They don't realize we're running the place.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:58.780]   Right.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.460]   Okay.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.340]   But let's engage.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.260]   Some people will look at DEI and go, well,
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.020]   that just gives me an opportunity just
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:06.900]   like anyone else.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.660]   I love DEI.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.420]   And other person will look at it and go,
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.140]   no, that gives, that says that you should
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:15.060]   be picked above me and I hate DEI.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:15.620]   Right.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.900]   So the reality of DEI is a little bit more
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.900]   complicated and so, but you got to go back.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.020]   So first, did we need affirmative
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.420]   action in the 1960s?
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.300]   Definitely.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.500]   Why?
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.940]   All the firefighter jobs in South Carolina,
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.500]   as an example, are going to white guys.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.420]   All the longshoremen jobs in New York,
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.740]   LA, wherever you have it, are all going
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.300]   to white guys.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.460]   Cause that's how the system was.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:38.740]   Yes.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.540]   Also in the North.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:39.940]   Right.
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:43.140]   So we now are in a civil rights era.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.660]   We decide we're going to go towards
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.060]   equality, minorities in that case, mainly
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.620]   black Americans had to find a way to break in.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.100]   I'm not trying to, like, if you're a longshoreman
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   and it's a good job, you naturally want
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.180]   to pass it on to your son.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.260]   I get your instinct.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.340]   I don't hate you for it.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:58.700]   Right.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.660]   But we got to let black kids also
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.340]   have a shot at it.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:01.820]   Right.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.060]   So you need it in the beginning, but at a
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.220]   certain point you have to phase it out.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.620]   So when I was growing up, it's now in the
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.900]   late eighties, early nineties, I hated
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.260]   affirmative action and I have been principled
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.460]   on it from day one.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.820]   And to this day, I don't, I'm not in favor
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.660]   of affirmative action.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.100]   I say it on the show all the time.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:20.580]   Why?
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.580]   I'm a minority.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.820]   Being a Turk, I grew up Muslim.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:28.420]   I'm an atheist now, but, but generally
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.020]   speaking, a Muslim is certainly a minority
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.060]   in America and pretty much a hated one overall.
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.540]   Uh, so, but I didn't check off Muslim or
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.420]   Turkish or any ethnicity when I applied to
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.420]   college because I believe in a meritocracy
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.420]   as we were talking about, but we don't
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.900]   really have a meritocracy now.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.020]   And so, but so I can come back to that,
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:52.220]   but, but right now, but so I didn't check
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.420]   it off because I didn't want an unfair
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.660]   advantage, uh, because I want to earn it.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.540]   I want to earn it.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.860]   So now I'm in law school and I'm hanging
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.380]   out with right-wingers because at that
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.500]   point I'm a Republican.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.980]   And one of the guys says to me about one
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.180]   of our, a black student, uh, going to Columbia.
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.220]   He says, oh, I wonder how he got in here.
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.940]   God, that is the problem with affirmative action.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.700]   It devalues the accomplishments of
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.220]   every minority in the country.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.500]   You have to transition away from it.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.260]   If you don't, it sets up a caste system.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.540]   And that caste system is lethal to democracy.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.660]   So does DEI go too far in some instances?
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.220]   Yes.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.700]   But is it a boogeyman that's going to
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.820]   take all the white jobs and make them
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.660]   black, as Trump would say black jobs, right.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.060]   And give minorities too much power, et cetera.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.940]   No, the idea isn't to rob you and to
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.820]   give all the opportunity to minorities.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.100]   The idea is to make it equal.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.620]   But as the pendulum swings, did it swing
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.980]   too far in some directions?
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.540]   Yes.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.420]   So the left can't acknowledge that.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.340]   And the right thinks can't acknowledge that.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.020]   Of course, at some point you got to give
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.020]   a chance for others to break in.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.460]   So they have a fair chance.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.980]   By the way, Michelle Obama had a good
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.060]   line about the black jobs and the, uh,
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:10.260]   the DNC speech where, uh, somebody should
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.780]   tell Trump that the presidency might
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.660]   be just one of those black jobs anyway.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.500]   Uh, but why do you think the left doesn't
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.460]   acknowledge when DI gets ridiculous, which
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:24.300]   it, uh, in certain places and in certain
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.540]   places at a large scale has, has gotten
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:30.620]   ridiculous because, uh, people are taught,
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.420]   uh, to just be in the tribe they're in
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.860]   and to believe it a hundred percent.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.260]   Like I've gotten kicked out of every tribe.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.420]   I'm the, I might be the most attack man
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:42.220]   in internet history, partly because we've
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.180]   been around forever.
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.420]   And partly because I disagree with every
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.500]   part of the political spectrum, because I
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.740]   believe in independent thought.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.580]   And the minute you vary a little bit,
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.660]   people go nuts.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:57.380]   And so the, the far left tribe, uh, is
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:00.660]   going to go with their preset ideology,
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.460]   just like the far right tribe is.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.420]   So for example, on trans issues, we've
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.340]   protected trans people for over 20 years
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.700]   in the young Turks, we fought for equality
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.740]   for trans people and for all LGBTQ people
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.700]   for two decades, we did it way before
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:20.180]   anyone else did when Biden came out in
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.220]   favor of gay marriage in 2013, we're like,
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.700]   this is comically late.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.500]   So like, we're all supposed to like
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.660]   congratulate him in the year 2013 that
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.460]   he thinks gay people should have the same
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.540]   rights as straight people.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.140]   And then he had to push Obama to get there.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:33.540]   Right.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:38.140]   So on the other hand, I'm like, guys,
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.780]   if you allow trans women to go into
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.620]   professional sports, not at the high school
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.580]   level, but professional sports, but let's
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.780]   say they go into MMA or boxing and a trans
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:51.260]   woman, I mean, it happens in boxing.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.060]   It happens in MMA, punches a biological
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.100]   woman so hard that he, that she kills her.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.820]   Right.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.100]   So you're going to set back trans rights,
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.380]   50 years, I'm not trying to hurt you.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.540]   I'm trying to help you.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.300]   You have to do bounds of reason.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.300]   So when I say simple things like that,
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.860]   and I say, you give LeBron James, every
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.660]   hormone blocker on planet earth, he's still
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.740]   going to dominate the WNBA.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.500]   Okay.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.860]   It would be comical.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.580]   He might score a hundred points a night.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:21.260]   Okay.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:24.380]   And they'll say, oh, that's outrageous.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.020]   And they've, some have called me Nazi for
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.180]   saying that trans women or that professional
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.980]   leagues should make their own decisions on
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.220]   whether they allow trans women are in or not.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.220]   So why do they say that?
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.140]   Cause they're so besieged.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.180]   They think we cannot give an inch.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.940]   We cannot give any ground.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.540]   If you give any ground, you're a Nazi.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.540]   Okay.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.860]   So we've got to get out of that mindset.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.060]   You're not, you can't function in a
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.780]   democracy and be in an extreme position and
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.580]   expect the rest of the country to go towards
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:56.700]   your extreme position.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:59.580]   So why do you think we are not in a meritocracy?
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:03.340]   So because of the corruption, it's, so for
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.180]   example, but there's also, but remember,
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:10.620]   corporate media is the matrix and they plug
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.900]   you into cable, right, in the old days.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.180]   Now it's a little bit different because of
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.060]   online media, but especially 10 years ago.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.820]   And remember we started 22 years ago, so I've
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.460]   been losing my mind over how obvious corporate
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.860]   media corruption has been for decades now.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:25.420]   Right.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:26.900]   But no one acknowledged it until
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.340]   online media got stronger.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.180]   But one of the myths that corporate media
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.100]   creates is the myth of meritocracy.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.460]   Not that meritocracy can't exist or shouldn't
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.220]   exist, but they pretend it exists today.
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:43.740]   So the problem with that myth Lex is that it
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.540]   gets people thinking, well, if they're already
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:49.100]   rich, they must have merited it by definition.
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.820]   So all the rich have merit and the reverse
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:56.300]   of that, if you're poor or middle-class, well,
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.660]   you must not have merited wealth.
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.540]   So you're no good.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.980]   We don't have to listen to you.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:05.460]   And that's a really dangerous, awful idea.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:10.020]   And so if we get to a meritocracy one day,
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.180]   I will, I'll be the happiest person in America.
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.140]   But right now it's, look here, I'll give
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.180]   you an example that I put in the book.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:21.740]   And they, and it's not us, this other folks
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.460]   that this YouTube video, I can't even quite
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.780]   find who they were, but it was a brilliant
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.060]   video and they said, okay, we're going to do
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.100]   a hundred yard race, but hold on before we
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.540]   start, anyone who has two parents take two
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:32.220]   steps forward.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:34.660]   Anyone who has went to college, take another
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.420]   two steps forward.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.340]   Anyone who doesn't have bills to pay for
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.140]   education anymore, take two steps forward.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.500]   They do all these things, right?
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.100]   And then at the end, before they start,
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.980]   somebody's 20 yards from the finish line.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.820]   And a lot of people are still at the starting
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.540]   line and then they go, okay, now we're going
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.260]   to run a race.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.460]   The guy who's right next to the finish line
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.020]   wins and they go meritocracy.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:00.260]   So the challenge there is to know which
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.180]   disparities, when you just freeze the system
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.500]   and observe are actually a result of some
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.540]   kind of discrimination or flaw in the system
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:09.340]   versus the result of a meritocracy of the
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.860]   better, of the better runner being ahead.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:12.780]   That's right.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.260]   There are some parts that are easy to solve
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:20.180]   like, so, you know, if you donated to a
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.500]   politician and he gave you a billion dollar
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.700]   subsidy, that's not meritocracy, right?
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.580]   So if you follow the money, you can see the
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.460]   flaws in the system.
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.060]   Exactly.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.740]   And so, and again, nothing's ever perfect
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.940]   at any snapshot of history, right?
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.860]   Or of the moment you're going to be at some
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.380]   point in the pendulum swing, but if you let,
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:40.860]   if you trust the people and you let the
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.780]   pendulum swing, but not wildly, then you're
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.380]   going to get to the right answers in the long run.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:49.100]   So you think, uh, this woke mind virus that
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:53.020]   the right refers to is, is, is a problem,
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:53.900]   but not a big problem.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:58.420]   No, so the right wing drives me crazy.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:03.500]   So look guys, your instincts of populism
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:04.180]   is correct.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:06.860]   Your instincts of anti-corruption is correct.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:07.420]   Right.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.740]   And I love you for it.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.660]   And so, and in a lot of ways, the right wing
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:14.500]   voters figured out the whole system screwed
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.180]   before left wing voters did.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.740]   I shouldn't say left wing voters because
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:18.860]   progressives in the left wing have been
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:21.380]   saying it for not only decades, but maybe
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.300]   centuries, right?
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:25.020]   But democratic voters, a lot of democratic
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.460]   voters, some of them actually like this
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.300]   current system.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.380]   Some of them, a lot of them have been tricked
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.740]   into liking this current system.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.140]   And the left should be fighting against
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.980]   corruption harder than the right, but right
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.940]   now, unfortunately, that's not the case.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.780]   So there's a lot that I like about right
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:40.380]   wing voters.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:40.860]   Okay.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.820]   But you guys get tricked on social
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.100]   issues so easily, right?
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.780]   So how many people are involved in trans
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:54.660]   high school sports and a girl who should
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.380]   have finished first in that track thing, you
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.340]   know, race in the middle of Indiana finished
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.220]   second, first of all, this is the big crime.
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.060]   This is, and how many people are involved?
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.620]   About seven, 13 out of a country of 330
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.660]   million people, and you can't see that
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.500]   that's a distraction, right?
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:17.140]   So, and everything that is like bait that
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.020]   the right wing media puts out there, they
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.340]   run after, I mean, Tucker Carlson doing
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.860]   insane segments about M and M's should be
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.180]   sexier, Mr.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.140]   Potato Head has gender issues.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.620]   Guys, get out of there.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.180]   Get out of there.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:30.940]   It's a trap.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:31.660]   Okay.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.220]   That doesn't mean that there, absolutely.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.300]   Uh, it doesn't mean that there's larger
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.940]   scale issues with things like DEI that
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.220]   aren't so fun to talk about or a viral
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:45.260]   to talk about an anecdotal scale.
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.300]   There is a DI does create a culture of
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.340]   fear with, with cancer culture.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.580]   And it does create a kind of culture that
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:57.980]   limits the freedom of expression and it
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.380]   does limit the meritocracy in another way.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.580]   So you're, you're basically saying forget
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:06.580]   all these other problems, money is the
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:07.500]   biggest problem.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.660]   So first of all, on AOC, as an example,
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.620]   and I don't mean to pick on her, but she
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:16.940]   won through the great work of her and
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.620]   Shoykat Chakrabarty and Corbyn Trent and
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.700]   others who are leaders of the justice
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.620]   Democrats that went and helped her campaign.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:27.260]   They were critical help and we all told
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:27.860]   her the same thing.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.020]   So it's not about me, me, me.
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.260]   And so we all said, you've got to
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.500]   challenge the establishment and you got
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.420]   to work on money in politics first.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.060]   Cause if you don't work on money in
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.700]   politics and you don't fix that, you're
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.100]   going to lose on almost all other issues.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:44.500]   But she didn't believe us because
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.380]   it's uncomfortable.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.620]   And all the progressives that went into
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.660]   Congress, they drive me crazy.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.220]   They think, oh no, no, you're exaggerating.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.220]   No, these are, and the minute they get
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.300]   in, all of a sudden my colleagues, right.
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.100]   Your colleagues hate you and they're
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.180]   going to drive you out.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.780]   You're a sucker and, and Jamal Bowman,
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.980]   Cori Bush, what'd they do?
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:05.100]   They drove them out.
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.820]   Marie Newman drove them out.
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:07.300]   Right.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.620]   And because they are not on your side,
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:10.860]   they're not your colleagues.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.540]   And what happened to $15 minimum wage?
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.900]   And I remember talking to one of those
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.740]   Congress people, I won't leave out the
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.620]   name and saying, hey, you know, they're
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.300]   not going to do $15 minimum wage.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.620]   And he's like, oh, Cenk, you're out of the loop.
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:25.100]   Nancy Pelosi assured us that they are
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.380]   going to do $15 minimum wage.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.980]   I'm like, I love you, but you're
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.220]   totally wrong, moneyed interests are
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.180]   not going to do $15 minimum wage.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.100]   You have to start fighting now.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:35.740]   Right.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.420]   And they didn't get it.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.820]   So they lost on almost all those issues
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.580]   because it's all about incentives and
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.020]   disincentives and rules.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.180]   If you don't fix the rules, you're going
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.140]   to constantly run into the same brick wall.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.620]   Now, the second issue that we were
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.260]   talking about is in the culture wars,
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.100]   the rest of us are stuck between the two
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:56.940]   extreme two percenters, right, on both sides.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.780]   So the two percenter on the left goes,
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:02.540]   you know, if you're a white woman, you
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.300]   need to shut up and listen now.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:04.940]   Okay.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:07.020]   That's ridiculous.
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:07.780]   No, you don't.
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.420]   If you're a white woman, you have every
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.020]   right to speak out, you have every right
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.500]   that every other human being has.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.260]   And so would I love for all of us to listen
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.460]   to one another, to have empathy for one
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.020]   another and go, hey, I wonder how a right
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.820]   winger thinks about this.
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.500]   I wonder how a left winger thinks about this.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.300]   I wonder why they think that way.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:24.660]   Right.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.460]   I love that.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:26.260]   And I want that.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.820]   So I want you to listen, but I
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:29.940]   don't want you to shut up.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.820]   So that 2% gets extreme.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.060]   And I, and I don't like it, but on the right
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.660]   wing, you got your 2% who think that that's
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.220]   all that's happening on the left.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.940]   And that's all that's happening in American
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.580]   politics.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.820]   And they think the entire left believes
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.580]   that tiny 2%, right.
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   And so they hate the left and they're
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.260]   like, oh, I'm not going to shut up.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.700]   I'm not going to wear a mask.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.220]   I'm not going to do any of these things
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.900]   and I'm not going to do any, that's a freedom.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:58.420]   And, and then a Republican comes along and
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.300]   goes, oh yeah, that thing you call freedom,
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.260]   that's deregulation for corporations because
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.860]   you shouldn't really have freedom.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.060]   Companies should have freedom.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:06.460]   Right.
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.540]   And then the guy goes, yeah, freedom for
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.660]   ExxonMobil.
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.940]   No brother, they tricked you.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.580]   The, the 2% on each side is then a useful
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.260]   distraction for, yes, for the corruption of
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:18.700]   the politicians via money.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.340]   Still we're, I'm talking about the 96% that
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.460]   remains in the middle and the impact that
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.940]   DEI policies has on them.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:25.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.220]   So here, here's where it gets absurd.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.780]   I'll give you a good example of absurdity.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:33.660]   So, um, in, in a school, I believe in
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:37.540]   California, uh, they, uh, noticed that Latino
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.140]   students were not doing as well in AP and
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.100]   honors classes, so they canceled AP and
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:43.820]   honors classes.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:44.700]   Oh, come on.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.380]   What are you doing?
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:46.660]   You're, that's nuts.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.300]   No, your job is to help them get better
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.740]   grades, get better opportunity, et cetera.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.100]   That's the harder thing to do and the right
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.460]   thing to do that your job isn't, I'm going
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.540]   to make everything equal by taking away the
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:04.020]   opportunity for higher achievement for other
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:06.100]   students, if that's what you're doing and you
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:07.660]   think you're on the left, you're not really
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.220]   on the left.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:10.060]   I actually think that's like an authoritarian
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.820]   position that a no progressive in their
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.220]   right mind would be in favor of.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:16.420]   So, but it's all definitional.
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.900]   So here's another example of
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.100]   definitional communism.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.700]   Like they say, oh my God, Kamala
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.660]   Harris is a communist.
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:26.180]   Well, when you're telling on yourself,
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.860]   brothers and sisters, when you say that, that
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.340]   means, A, I don't know what communism means.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.780]   And B, I don't have any idea what's going
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.980]   on in American politics.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.060]   Kamala Harris is a corporatist.
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:39.300]   That's her problem.
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.620]   Not that she's a communist.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:43.660]   She's on the other end of the spectrum, right?
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:46.340]   The, the idea that Kamala Harris would come
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.740]   into office and say, that's it, there's no
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:49.580]   more private property.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.060]   We're going to take all of your homes and
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.220]   it's now government property.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.460]   They're all your cars, et cetera.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.820]   She was not going to get within
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.100]   a billion miles of that.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.300]   Her donors would never allow her to get
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.540]   within a billion miles of that.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.020]   That is so preposterous that when you say
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.900]   something like that, it's disqualifying.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.580]   Like I can't debate someone who thinks
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.700]   that Democrats are communists when they're
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.140]   actually largely corporatists.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.740]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:14.340]   So let's go there.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:17.020]   So when people call her a communist, they're
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:19.380]   usually referring to certain kinds of policies.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:23.340]   So do you think I mean, I think it's a, it's
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.620]   a ridiculous label to assign to Kamala Harris,
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:28.300]   especially given the history of communism
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.980]   in the 20th century and what those economic
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:34.820]   and political policies have led to the scale
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.580]   of suffering that led to, and it just degrades
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:38.900]   the meaning of the word, right?
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.980]   But to take that seriously,
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.340]   why is she not a communist?
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:45.340]   So you said she's not a communist
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.540]   because she's a corporatist.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:47.420]   Okay.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.420]   But that can't be, okay.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:53.300]   Everybody in politics is a corporate.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.060]   Just almost, almost everybody in politics
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.260]   is a corporate, but that doesn't mean the
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.500]   corporations have completely bought their mind.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.900]   They have an influence on their mind and issues
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.540]   that matter to those corporations.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:05.900]   Yep.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:06.580]   Right.
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.460]   Like outside of that, they're still thinking
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.900]   for the voters cause they still have to win the votes.
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:12.700]   Barely.
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.140]   Okay.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.100]   So here, let me give you an example.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.380]   So you see what I'm saying?
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:22.260]   So if you were just wanted votes, you would
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.620]   do a lot of what Tim Walz did.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.380]   Okay.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.460]   And, and by the way, a lot of what Bernie
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:27.980]   did, that's why Bernie, who had no media
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:32.020]   coverage, went from like 2% in 2015 to by
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.420]   the end, about 48%, because he was just doing
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:36.900]   things that were popular, right.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.340]   And that American people wanted, et cetera.
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:39.700]   Right.
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.660]   Because he's not controlled by corporations.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.540]   By the way, neither is Tom Massey on the
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:45.140]   right wing side, on the Republican side.
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:45.460]   Right.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.500]   So it's not all, that's why I always say
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.460]   almost all, right.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.580]   So if you're doing things that are popular,
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.340]   people love it.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:54.540]   So today, what would Kamala Harris do if she
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.660]   actually just wanted to win?
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:56.100]   Right.
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.060]   So number one, she was trying to pass
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.380]   paid family leave right now.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.380]   Why?
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:06.420]   It pulls at 84% and even 74% of Republicans
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:06.700]   want it.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:07.460]   Why?
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.740]   Cause it says, hey, when you have a baby,
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:12.660]   you should get 12 weeks off, bond with your baby.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.620]   Right now, in a lot of States that don't
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.700]   have paid family leave, you have to go back
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.220]   to work the very next day, or you have to
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.700]   use all of your sick days, all your vacation
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.540]   days, just to have two, one or two weeks
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.740]   with your baby, right?
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:28.340]   So conservatives love paid family leave.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.700]   Liberals love paid family leave.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.100]   That's why it pulls so high.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.620]   So why isn't she proposing it?
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:35.340]   It's not in our economic plan.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.220]   Tim Walz already passed it in Minnesota.
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:38.860]   He showed how easy it was.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:41.580]   If you want votes, it's, and then you know
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.820]   what's going to happen if you propose paid
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.220]   family leave, the Republicans are going to
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:47.300]   go, no, our beloved corporations don't want
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.500]   to spend another dollar on moms.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:49.980]   Right.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.620]   And they fall for that trap.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.700]   And then you're in infinitely better shape.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.700]   So why doesn't she do it?
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.060]   She doesn't do it because her corporate
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.420]   donors don't want her to do it.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.020]   $15 minimum wage layup over two thirds of
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.500]   the country wants it because it not only
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.180]   gives you higher wages for minimum wage
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.140]   folks, but it pushes wages up for others.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.900]   And what do the elite say?
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.180]   Oh, that's going to drive up inflation.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.060]   Oh, you shouldn't get paid anymore.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.020]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.540]   So you're saying all the other prices
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:17.860]   should go up, but the only thing that
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.460]   shouldn't go up is our wages.
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.820]   No, our wages should go up.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.500]   Okay.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.140]   So these are all easy ones.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:25.820]   Here's another one.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:26.580]   Anti-corruption.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.580]   Why isn't she running on getting
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.420]   money out of politics?
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.060]   It pulls it over 90%.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.900]   Why isn't Trump running on it anymore?
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.020]   He won when he ran on it in 2016.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.420]   He didn't mean a word of it, but he ran on it.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.140]   It was smart.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.860]   They don't do it because their corporate
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.940]   donors take their heads off if they do.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.580]   So in contradiction to that, why did
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.340]   she propose to raise the corporate tax
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.940]   rate from whatever, 21% to 28%?
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.340]   Because that's easy because that is
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.860]   something that's super popular and
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:56.620]   she's not going to do it.
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.060]   That's why.
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:00.780]   So, so guys, this is, this is where
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.620]   I break the hearts of blue MAGA.
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:05.420]   Uh, blue MAGA thinks, oh my God, these
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.540]   Democrats, they're angels and the right
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.540]   wing is, and the Republicans are evil.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.180]   And, and they, they work for big business,
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.460]   but not Kamala Harris, not Joe Biden.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:14.900]   Right.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.140]   Okay.
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.020]   Well, Donald Trump took the corporate
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:20.460]   tax rate from 35% to 21%.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.780]   So that's trillions of dollars that got
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:24.380]   transferred because guys, you got to
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:27.140]   understand if the corporations don't pay
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:30.780]   it, we have to pay it because we're running
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.940]   up these giant deficits and eventually
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:34.700]   either they're going to not eventually
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.740]   keep raising our taxes in different ways
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.780]   that you're not noticing.
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.300]   They keep increasing fees and fines and
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:41.660]   different ways for the government to
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.460]   collect money.
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:43.980]   So we're paying for it.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.300]   And on top of that, eventually they're
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.460]   going to cut your social security and
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.860]   Medicare because they're gonna say, oh,
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.500]   we don't have any options left anymore.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:50.980]   You don't have any options left anymore
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.300]   because you kept giving trillions of
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.020]   dollars in tax cuts to corporations.
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.900]   So we're going to have to pay for that.
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.100]   So then Trump, then Biden says, oh my
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:59.660]   God, I'm going to bring corporate
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.700]   taxes back up to 28%.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.740]   I'm like, wait, hold on.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.620]   They were at 35.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.620]   You already did a sleight of hand and
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.220]   said 28, okay.
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:11.020]   Then he gets into office and Manchin says,
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:13.940]   no, 25, that's the highest I'll go.
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.020]   And he goes, okay, fine.
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:15.620]   25.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.540]   And then while you're not looking,
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:18.340]   they just dump it.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.300]   They don't even do 25.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.460]   It's still a 21.
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.460]   So hear me now, quote me later.
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.220]   I do predictions on the show all the time
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.020]   because you, you should hold me accountable.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.820]   You should hold all your pundits accountable.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:31.060]   If you held all your pundits accountable,
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.260]   we'd be the last man standing and
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.060]   that's kind of what happened.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:33.860]   Okay.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.900]   So I guarantee you, she will
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:38.300]   not increase corporate taxes.
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:40.340]   So would the same be the case for price
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.780]   controls or the anti-price gouging that
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.300]   she's proposing?
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.420]   So it's not price controls, it's
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:46.420]   price, anti-price gouging.
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.300]   It is price controls, but I mean,
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.460]   minimum wage is price controls also.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.900]   Now we're going to get into a lot of
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.940]   minutiae, but I'll try to keep it broad.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.740]   So price controls are a disaster.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:57.820]   They never work.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:00.060]   If you say, oh, here's a banana.
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.820]   It has to stay at a dollar, a pound,
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:02.820]   make up a number, right?
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:05.540]   Well, supply and demand is going to move.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.540]   And then that's going to, and so the minute
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.540]   it moves to $2 of where the price should
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.420]   be, then you're going to run into shortages.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:13.700]   So we all know this, it's a bad idea, right?
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.380]   But are there laws against price gouging?
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.340]   There already are, and they're a good idea.
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.700]   So why?
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.660]   Like you have a natural disaster, all of a
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:24.220]   sudden, uh, the water that was a dollar,
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.740]   now they're charging a hundred dollars.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.420]   The government has to come in,
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.740]   democratic capitalism, they come in and go,
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.980]   no, I'm going to protect the people.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:33.580]   So you're not allowed to price gouge.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.980]   You know, maybe charge $2, et cetera, but
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.740]   you're not going to charge a hundred, but
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.660]   it is temporary.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.620]   We get, we get that done.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:43.420]   We ended the problem there and then we bring
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:44.940]   it back to a normal supply and demand.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:45.420]   Okay.
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:47.100]   So that's what she's proposing.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:50.060]   It's so that's all political because the
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.580]   price gouging has already passed.
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.460]   They did it in 21 and 22.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:55.740]   And so now the grocery stores are
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:57.220]   actually low margin business.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.660]   She really, she says grocery stores.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.060]   That's how I know she doesn't mean it
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.580]   because the grocery stores weren't the
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.660]   problem, consumer goods were the problem.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.180]   Those companies.
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:08.540]   She's following the polls where most people
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.340]   say that the groceries are too expensive.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:14.180]   So she's just basically address saying the
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.100]   most popular thing.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.300]   A hundred percent.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.340]   And you could tell in which proposals she
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.180]   means it and which proposals she doesn't
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:22.140]   because of the, of the framing.
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:22.660]   Right.
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:27.300]   So this is a mediocre example, but in housing,
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.220]   she said, we have to stop private equity from
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:33.060]   buying, uh, houses in bulk.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.220]   I'm like, huh, curious that they put the
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:37.700]   word in bulk there.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.820]   Why does it have to be in bulk?
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.980]   Why don't we just stop them from
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.180]   buying any residential home?
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.540]   Like you could set up normal boundaries, right?
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.300]   Uh, for example, Charlie Kirk was on the
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.220]   Young Turks this week.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.380]   By the way, sorry to take that tangent.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:51.540]   I really enjoyed that conversation.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.420]   I really enjoyed that.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.620]   You talked to, that was like civil, you
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.060]   guys disagreed pretty intensely, but like
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.220]   there was a lot of respect.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.100]   I really enjoyed that.
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:00.980]   Thank you, brother.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:02.060]   That was like, that was beautiful.
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.180]   You and Charlie Kirk and I think Anna was there.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.020]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:08.300]   So yeah, quick tangent.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.700]   And, uh, look, I, I've done a lot of
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:12.340]   yelling online.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:13.140]   Okay.
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:18.660]   And I, I yell when a, there's a issue that
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.100]   you should be passionate about 40,000 people,
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.900]   25,000 women and children, uh, slaughtered
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:25.540]   in Gaza.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:27.500]   If you're not emotionally upset by that and
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.540]   you think it's no big deal, I think that's
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:30.020]   a problem.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.580]   But when you add gaslighting on top, that's
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.460]   what drives me crazy.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.340]   And then when you add filibustering on top,
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.700]   then that sets me off.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.900]   So for all my life, right wing has gone on
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.100]   cable and filibustered.
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.100]   They take up so much more time than the left
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.300]   wing guests and the left wing guests always
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.820]   like, cause, oh, okay, well, I'm offended.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:49.580]   He's taking up too much time.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.700]   No brother, go over the top, go over the top.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.660]   You're not going to talk over me.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.540]   I'm going to talk over you.
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:54.200]   Okay.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.300]   So, and, uh, and then when you gaslight and
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.020]   you go, oh no, 1200 people in Israel being
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:05.620]   killed is awful, which it is, but 40,000
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.260]   people being killed in Gaza is no big deal.
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.300]   We should keep giving them money.
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.460]   Keep killing, keep killing.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.260]   And that that's normal.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.260]   No, it's not normal.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:13.820]   I'm not going to let you say it's normal.
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:14.860]   That's nuts.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:15.440]   Okay.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.100]   When you, like we were against the Iraq war,
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.140]   there was only two shows that were on the air
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.380]   nationally that were against the Iraq war, us
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:25.060]   and democracy now with Amy Goodman.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:29.180]   And, and at the time I used to yell all the
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.340]   time because mainstream media would gaslight
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.020]   the fuck out of us.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.740]   We're going to be greeted as liberators.
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.380]   Me and Ben Mankiewicz on the air.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.700]   Ben doesn't yell as much.
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.260]   He's now the host of Turner classic movies,
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:42.220]   but we're, he's saying it in a calm way.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:43.700]   I'm saying it in a screaming way.
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.100]   We're not going to be greeted as liberators.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.340]   When you drop a bomb on someone's head,
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.100]   they don't greet you as a liberator.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.460]   Stop saying insane things.
[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.380]   And seven out of 10 Americans thought
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.660]   that Saddam Hussein had personally
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:58.140]   attacked us on 9/11.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.740]   We got lied into that war by corporate media.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:01.440]   Okay.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.780]   Now there's one, there's a couple of good
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:04.700]   things that Trump has done.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.340]   One is get people to realize corporate
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:08.860]   media is the matrix, right?
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:11.340]   And so now, and get them to an anti-war
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.620]   position, he himself doesn't have an anti-war
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.220]   position, but his voters do.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:16.180]   And that's a positive.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.260]   We can come back to that.
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.020]   But these days, the reason why the Charlie
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.580]   Kirk conversations are going great and Rudy
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.940]   Giuliani and Mike Lindell, and historically
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.500]   though, we've been, go back again, 10 years,
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.580]   20 years, we've always been respectful when
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:33.740]   someone comes on our show and we have a debate.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:35.820]   As long as they're not yelling, I match
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.180]   the tenor of the host, right?
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:39.740]   You and I are having a reasonable conversation.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:41.300]   I'm not raising my voice.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:43.140]   I'm not yelling at you for no reason.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:43.640]   Right.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.580]   So now when Charlie's not going to battle
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:51.100]   anymore for like talking points, I'm shutting
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:54.060]   off my mind, all I'm doing is yelling at you.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:55.340]   Then I'm going to yell back at him.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:57.340]   But now he's saying, okay, let's have
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:58.340]   a reasonable conversation.
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:58.660]   Great.
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:38:59.300]   I love it.
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.860]   I love reasonable conversations.
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:01.660]   It was great.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:02.420]   It was refreshing.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.700]   And, uh, what were we talking about?
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.060]   You buying up, buying up housing.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:07.460]   Yes.
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:11.220]   So Charlie, when he was on said, Hey, listen,
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:13.020]   you know, I think that there should be a cap though.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:14.220]   I forget if he said 10 billion or a
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.020]   hundred billion in assets.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.260]   If you have less than that, you should be,
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.780]   still be able to do real estate as an
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:21.380]   investment, even if it's residential.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:24.060]   But above that, it gets to, okay, that's good.
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:24.700]   No problem.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.020]   Well, we can have a debate about that.
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.140]   When you figure out is the right number
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.980]   10, 125, no problem.
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:31.980]   You could put in reasonable limitations,
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:35.100]   but, but we got to get them to stop buying the homes.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.060]   So when Kamala Harris says, Oh, we'll
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:40.100]   stop them from buying homes in bulk.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.500]   I'm like, okay, there's the loophole.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.780]   And so they're going to use that loophole.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:45.580]   And besides which it's not going to pass
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.660]   wall street owns the government.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.100]   So there's no way corporate Republicans
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.020]   and Democrats, which are about 98% of
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.340]   politicians are going to limit private equity.
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:56.060]   And, and so when do we ever
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.180]   get a little bit of change?
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.300]   When Democrats are in charge, they do
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:03.020]   five to 15% of their agenda.
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.940]   And that's not because they're warmhearted.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.020]   It's a release valve, right?
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:13.340]   Oh, see under Obama, we got about 5% change.
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.700]   And what was that?
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.260]   That was Obamacare, right?
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:20.060]   That was most of the change that we got.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:22.860]   And what's the greatest part of Obamacare.
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:24.660]   And now I, a lot of right-wing also agree,
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.580]   almost all of right-wing agree about this
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.700]   portion, which is they got rid of the bias
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:31.180]   against preexisting conditions.
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:33.220]   Why did they do that particularly?
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:37.820]   Because the country was about to get in a fucking rage.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.900]   We all have preexisting conditions.
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.140]   If you deny me when I'm sick, what the fuck's
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:43.740]   the point of insurance, right?
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.620]   And the anger had gotten to a nuclear level.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:49.020]   So the release valve, get rid of preexisting
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.660]   conditions, let's go back to just milking
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.140]   them regularly and oh, by the way, put in a
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:56.660]   mandate so that they have to buy it from us.
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:57.380]   Right.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:00.140]   Do you know who originally came up with Obamacare?
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.300]   The Heritage Foundation.
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:04.300]   It was their proposal.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.260]   Romney did it in Massachusetts.
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.780]   It was called Romneycare.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.820]   So I think this is a super important election,
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.780]   but I've earned the credibility to be able
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.260]   to say that because in 2012, I said, this is
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.020]   a largely unimportant election.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:20.300]   Mitt Romney and Barack Obama's policies on
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.380]   economic issues are near identical.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:26.260]   Obamacare was literally Romneycare.
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:28.220]   Right now, the left says, oh, the Heritage
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.940]   Foundation, it's so dangerous.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:31.500]   Project 2025.
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.540]   Well, brother, they're the ones who wrote
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:36.300]   Obamacare and you say that's the greatest
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.620]   change in the world, right?
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:41.180]   So that's why the Democrats, yeah, I'll
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.020]   take the 10% change overall.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.540]   I think Biden did about 15%, but Obama did 5%.
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:49.540]   But they're going to, they'll also march
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:51.540]   you backwards by deregulating like Clinton
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:53.500]   did and Obama did the bank bailouts like
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.420]   Obama did, but 10% is better than 0%, but
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:57.580]   it's not to help you.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.580]   It's the release valve.
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.100]   So the system keeps going.
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.580]   Is it possible to steel man the case that,
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.580]   uh, that not all politicians are corporatists
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:12.420]   or, or maybe how would you approach that?
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.260]   For example, this podcast has a bunch of
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.460]   sponsors and I give zero fucks about what
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:19.660]   they think about what I'm saying.
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:21.100]   Like I have zero control over me.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:23.740]   Um, maybe you could say that's not, that's
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:25.540]   because it's not a lot of money or maybe
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:29.780]   he's, maybe I'm a unique person or something
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:32.740]   like this, but, um, I just think it's
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.020]   possible to have, and I would like to
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.540]   believe a lot of politicians that this
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:39.260]   way that they have ideas and while they
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:42.860]   take money, they kind of, uh, see it as a
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:45.860]   game that, you know, you accept the money,
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:49.900]   kind of go to certain parties, hug people
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.060]   and so on, but it doesn't actually
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:55.700]   fundamentally compromise, um, your integrity
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:57.180]   on issues you actually care about.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.300]   I can steel man almost anything.
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.820]   Uh, I can steel man Trump.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:03.780]   I can steel man conservatives easily, right?
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.460]   Uh, corporate politicians is a hard one.
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:09.700]   So first, um, then it's not all politicians.
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.020]   We can start out nice and easy.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:14.820]   Tom Massey, uh, now Holly and Gates
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:16.900]   taking, uh, not taking corporate PAC money.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.500]   Uh, Bernie, the squad, they don't
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:20.220]   take corporate PAC money.
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:22.500]   You could disagree on either end of those,
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:26.540]   uh, folks on social issues, but generally
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:29.180]   they are a thousand times less corrupt.
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.380]   They're more honest.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.500]   Uh, and part of the reason you might hate
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:33.980]   the squad is because they're so honest.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:36.140]   They tell you their real opinion on social
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.500]   issues that you really disagree with.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.100]   A lot of the corporate politicians won't
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:40.380]   do that because they're trying to get as
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.860]   many votes as possible so they can fillet
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:45.020]   their donors, uh, when they get into office
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.300]   and do all their favors for them.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:46.660]   Okay.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:48.060]   But you see, I'm already falling apart
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:50.180]   on the steel manning of corporate politicians.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.300]   Let's like zoom in on that.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.420]   So if you take corporate PAC money,
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:55.860]   you're, that's it.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.060]   You're, you're corrupted.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.820]   I mean, can you imagine yourself, say
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.420]   you're a politician, you're a president,
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:05.300]   uh, you're a human being, you're a person
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.660]   with integrity, you're a person who
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.580]   thinks about the world.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.300]   You're saying if I was a corporate
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:12.180]   PAC and I give you a billion dollars,
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.220]   you still, you'd be, I could tell you
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:14.660]   anything.
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:17.180]   So Lex, everything is a spectrum.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:18.460]   Humanity is a spectrum.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:21.860]   So can you find outliers who could take
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:24.460]   corporate PAC money and still be principled
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.980]   enough to resist this lure?
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:28.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.500]   Uh, and, and I would hope that I would
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.780]   be a person like that, but I wouldn't
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.260]   take corporate PAC money, but if you force
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.660]   me to, uh, I think I would still
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.940]   stay principled and do it.
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:39.180]   Could you find 10, 20 other people in the
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:39.740]   country?
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:44.380]   But on average, that is not what will
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:44.780]   happen.
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.100]   What will happen is they will take the
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.700]   money and do exactly as they are told.
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:52.340]   I think most people have integrity.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.780]   Okay.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:54.300]   Okay.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:54.580]   Hold on.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:56.980]   So what I'm more worried about is when
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.820]   you take corporate PAC money, it's not
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.620]   that you are immediately sold, is over time.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:03.260]   Over time.
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:03.740]   That's true.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.020]   So yeah, I get it.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:08.500]   Um, but I wonder if, if the integrity
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.700]   that I think most people have can withstand
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:15.260]   the gradual slippery slope of, uh, uh, of
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.820]   the effect of corporate money, which if,
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:21.020]   if what I'm saying is true, that most
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:23.260]   people have integrity, one of the ways to
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:25.900]   solve the effect of corporate money is
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:26.540]   term limits.
[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:29.060]   Because it takes time to corrupt people.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:30.660]   You can't buy them immediately.
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:34.700]   And then the term limits can, uh, uh, for
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:38.380]   the listener, Jenkins, uh, shaking his head.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.420]   No.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:41.060]   So look, you're right that, uh, over
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.220]   time, it gets way worse.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.620]   And as we talked about earlier, Biden's
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:44.900]   a great example of that comes in.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:47.100]   Anti-corruption winds up being totally
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.380]   pro-corruption by the end.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:51.700]   Um, and, but he was also here for almost
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:53.940]   all of it, as we started in a world that
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.060]   was not run by money in politics, and it's
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.940]   now completely run by money in politics.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:00.460]   So, uh, does it get worse over time?
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:03.140]   Cinema is a Kristen cinema in, uh, Arizona
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.580]   is a great example of that comes in as a
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:07.220]   progressive, doesn't want to take PAC money,
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:09.940]   uh, cares about the average person, et
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:10.500]   cetera.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.540]   Uh, over time, she becomes the biggest
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:15.580]   corporatist in the Senate, uh, and a total
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:16.260]   disaster.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:19.500]   Uh, but if you say that the majority of,
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:22.340]   uh, politicians have been, I don't know if
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.060]   this is what you're saying.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:25.780]   Majority of politicians have integrity.
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:29.260]   Um, no, let's start at the majority of
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.100]   human beings.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:34.860]   I think that politicians are not, there are
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:38.380]   not a special group of like sociopaths.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.100]   I think they are.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.060]   They lean a little bit towards that
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:43.020]   direction, but they're not like only
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:44.700]   sociopaths go into politics.
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:47.060]   It's like, you have to have some sociopathic
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:48.980]   qualities, I think, to go into politics,
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:51.380]   but, but they're not complete sociopaths.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.700]   I think they do have integrity.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:55.780]   Cause sometimes for very selfish reasons,
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:58.500]   it's not all about money, even for a selfish
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.820]   person, for a narcissist.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:02.860]   It's, it's also about being recognized
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:05.220]   for having had positive impact on the world.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:08.660]   Yeah, I get it, but all right.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.300]   So let's break it down.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.500]   So first, uh, human beings, then
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.380]   we'll get to politicians.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.380]   Do human beings have integrity?
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.300]   Well, it's a spectrum.
[01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:19.580]   So some people are, have enormous integrity.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:21.140]   Some people have no integrity.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:25.740]   So there is not one type or character, right?
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.140]   So some people have a ton of empathy for
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.900]   other human beings and they literally feel it.
[01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:33.060]   Like I feel the pain of someone else.
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:34.420]   And I'm not alone.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:35.940]   Most people feel the pain of someone else.
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.740]   If you see it on video, a baby being
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.340]   hurt, an overwhelming majority of, of
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.780]   human beings will go, no, right.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:45.660]   You have empathy.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:47.220]   That's a natural feeling that you have.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.380]   Some people have no empathy because
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:51.460]   they're on the extreme end of the
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:54.260]   spectrum, uh, serial killers and Donald Trump.
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:55.820]   Uh, okay.
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:59.260]   And so I'm, I'm partly joking, but not
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:02.820]   really, he has never demonstrated any empathy
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:05.180]   that I have ever seen for any other human being.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:06.900]   I'm going to trigger some right-wingers
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.620]   cause they think every terrible thing he
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:11.220]   said is out of context or joking or not
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:14.100]   real or fake news, but his chief of staff
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:14.940]   didn't make it up.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:17.540]   He called, uh, people who went into
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:19.060]   the military suckers and losers.
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:20.460]   Why, why did he say that?
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.380]   If just hang with me for a second,
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:23.380]   don't have your head explode.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:23.860]   Okay.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:25.620]   I'm not saying the likes I'm saying to the
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.420]   right-wingers out there.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:26.740]   Right.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:29.980]   So the reason is because if you're like
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:31.900]   Trump and you don't, you literally
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:33.380]   don't feel the empathy.
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:35.940]   You think, why the hell would I go in the
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.100]   military, get killed for someone else?
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:39.580]   What a sucker.
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:41.620]   No, I'm going to stay out of the military.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:42.660]   I'm going to stay alive.
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.260]   I'm going to make a ton of money and I'm
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.220]   going to look out for myself.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:49.100]   And he assumes, because everybody does this,
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.020]   you assume that everyone thinks like
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.580]   you do, but they don't.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:55.060]   So Trump assumes everybody's as much
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:56.700]   of a dirt bag as he is.
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.620]   And because he doesn't feel it, he
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:48:59.780]   doesn't feel the empathy.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:02.940]   And so he's like, yeah, you'd be an idiot,
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.340]   a sucker and a loser to go into the
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.900]   military and have a sacrifice for other
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:07.460]   people.
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.420]   So you see the spectrum, even if you think
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.900]   Trump's not on that end and you think I'm
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.140]   wrong about that, you get that there are
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:13.340]   people on that end, right?
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:16.260]   So you have a spectrum of integrity,
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.580]   empathy, et cetera.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.380]   That's what I would call your hardware.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:22.060]   You layer on top of that, your software.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:22.540]   Okay.
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:24.620]   And the software is cultural influences.
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:28.620]   Your parents, media, your friends, all
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:30.140]   these are cultural influences.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:34.300]   So now when you're in certain industries,
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.500]   they value more integrity.
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:39.860]   So religious leaders, if you're doing it
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.860]   right, which is also very rare, right?
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.980]   But if you're doing it right, you're supposed
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:45.620]   to have empathy for the poor, the needy,
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.220]   the whole flock, right?
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:51.420]   So that profession is incentivizing you
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:52.940]   towards empathy and integrity.
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:53.540]   Okay.
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:56.980]   And even then a giant amount of people
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:57.900]   abuse it, right?
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:58.820]   But okay, good.
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:02.060]   In politics, it creates incentives
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:04.780]   for the opposite, no integrity.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:08.700]   And that software to your point over time
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.380]   gets stronger and stronger and stronger
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:12.740]   until it takes over.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:14.740]   Now you might have someone with a lot of
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:16.820]   integrity, like Tom Massey, right?
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.860]   A Republican from Kentucky.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.340]   And whether I agree with him or disagree
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:24.540]   with him on policy, I get that the brother
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:26.420]   is actually doing it based on principles.
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.220]   And there isn't any amount of money you
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:30.140]   can give Tom Massey for him to change
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:30.820]   his principles.
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:31.380]   Why?
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.900]   He's on the principled end of the spectrum
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.140]   as a human being, right?
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.100]   So is Bernie.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.660]   They're in the same part of that, that
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:38.700]   spectrum, right?
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.060]   But for most people, the great majority
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:44.220]   of the spectrum, if you overload them with
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.900]   software that incentivizes them to not have
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.660]   integrity, they will succumb.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.780]   And now let's switch to
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:51.980]   politicians in particular.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:55.780]   Why do I think that they're on average far
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:58.340]   more likely to be on the sociopathic part
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:02.220]   of the spectrum because of the incentives
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:02.980]   and disincentives.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:05.940]   So this changes every congressional cycle.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:08.020]   And when just Democrats were winning a lot,
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.940]   it got all the way down to 87 and a half
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.660]   percent, but on average for congressional
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.140]   elections, the person with more money wins
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.860]   95% of the time.
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.260]   It doesn't matter if they're a liberal
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:20.180]   or conservative Republican or Democrat
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:23.980]   or any ideology they have 95%.
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:24.580]   Okay.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:27.060]   So now let's say you got the 5% that went
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.700]   in, uh, that are not hooked on the money.
[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:31.900]   Well, they're going to get a primary
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:32.980]   challenge, then they're going to get a
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:34.220]   general election challenge.
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.700]   And 95% of the time, the one with more
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:37.300]   money wins.
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:40.260]   So eventually this system cycles through
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:42.420]   until only the core, almost only the
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:43.180]   corrupt are left.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.260]   Wait, hold on a second.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.220]   Is that, is that real 95%?
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:52.140]   So if you have more money, 95% of the
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:53.300]   time you win, huh?
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:54.060]   Yes.
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:59.540]   I'd like to believe that's less the case
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.060]   for, for example, for higher you get.
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:02.900]   Yes, that's true.
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:03.380]   You're right.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:04.620]   So you know why?
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.700]   So the presidential race is ironically in
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.060]   some ways, the least corrupt.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:12.380]   So let's dive into why.
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:15.100]   If you're running a local race anywhere in
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:16.500]   the country, you're going to get almost no
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.220]   press coverage, meaning congressional race,
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:18.620]   right?
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:20.780]   If you're running a Senate race in the
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.420]   middle of Montana, you're going to get
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:24.620]   almost no media coverage.
[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:27.540]   So that's where your money in politics has
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.620]   the most effect because then you could
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:30.980]   just buy the airwaves.
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:32.820]   You outspend the other guy, you get all
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:33.180]   the ads.
[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:35.100]   Plus you get the friendly media coverage
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:36.780]   because he just bought a couple of million
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:39.060]   dollars of ads in the middle of Montana.
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:41.460]   So the local news loves you, the TV
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.300]   stations, the radio stations, the papers.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:45.500]   So some of the papers are principled.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.380]   They might say, Oh no, but overall, they're
[01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:48.500]   not calling you a radical.
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:49.740]   They're not calling you anything.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:51.540]   And you're buying those races.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:53.540]   But when you get to the presidential race,
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.060]   that's much harder because presidential
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:58.740]   race, you have earned media, free media
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:00.660]   that overwhelms paid media.
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:03.540]   Perfect examples, 2016, Hillary Clinton
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.860]   outraces Trump by about two to one, but
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:06.700]   she loses anyway.
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:07.540]   Why?
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:11.100]   Cause Trump got almost twice as much earned
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:12.340]   media as she did.
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:13.860]   And the earned media is better.
[01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:15.220]   It's inside the content.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:15.820]   Right.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:16.940]   That is definitely better.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:21.140]   So in a presidential election, as long as
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:23.780]   you got past the primary, you could actually
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.860]   win with not that much money.
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:29.220]   And, and that's part of the reason why I
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:32.340]   have hope Lex, because all you got to do is
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:34.780]   get past a Republican or Democratic primary.
[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:36.700]   And now that's very, very, very difficult,
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:38.820]   but Trump did it right now.
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:40.900]   He took it in the wrong direction, but he
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.980]   did get leave a blueprint for how to do it.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.620]   And so once you get to the general election,
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:47.940]   you're off to the races, you could do any
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.940]   goddamn thing you like.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:49.500]   Okay.
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:50.900]   You could be super popular.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:52.540]   You don't have to give a shit about the donors.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:53.700]   You can get into office.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.700]   You could bully your own party and the other
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.660]   party into doing what you want and you can
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:58.340]   get everything done.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.820]   You could even get money out of politics.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.060]   So don't lose hope.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.420]   I mean, we even started Operation Hope at
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:06.660]   TYT and our first project was to knock Biden
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:08.660]   out and everybody said, you guys are nuts.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:09.700]   That's totally impossible.
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:11.380]   And we knocked Biden out.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:11.940]   All right.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.060]   Did we do it alone?
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:13.740]   Of course not.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.100]   We were a small part of it, right?
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:20.100]   But we laid the groundwork for hope and we
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:21.860]   laid the groundwork for when he flopped in
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:24.500]   the debate, people had already been told,
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.700]   remember, he's bad, he's old, he's not right.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:28.260]   And the debate proved it.
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:30.460]   If we hadn't done that groundwork and not
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.860]   just Young Turks, obviously, but Axelrod
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:36.180]   and Carville and Nate Silver and Ezra Klein,
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:38.660]   et cetera, Charlemagne, the God, Jon Stewart,
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:41.660]   all these people helped a lot so that when
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:45.140]   the debate happened, it confirmed the idea
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:47.060]   that out there that he was too old and couldn't do it.
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:51.340]   So my point is, hope is, if you lose hope,
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.300]   you're done for, then they're definitely
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.220]   going to win, right?
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.220]   Hope is the most dangerous thing in
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:57.580]   the world for the elites.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.460]   So whether you're right-wing or left-wing,
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:01.060]   I need you to have hope and I need you to
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.860]   understand it's not misplaced.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.420]   We just got to get past the primary and we're
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:06.740]   going to turn this whole thing around.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.420]   So you, basically a presidential
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:14.180]   candidate who's a populist, who in part
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.540]   runs on getting money out of politics.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:18.340]   Okay.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.980]   Well, then let's talk about Donald Trump.
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:24.420]   So to me, the two biggest criticisms of
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:28.540]   Trump is the fake election scheme.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:31.380]   Out of that whole 2020 election, the fake
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:33.740]   election scheme is the thing that really bothers me.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.820]   And then the second thing across a larger
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:42.500]   timescale is the counterproductive division
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:45.220]   that he's created in, let's say, our public
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:45.860]   discourse.
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:48.340]   What are your top five criticisms of Trump?
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:48.780]   Okay.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:52.380]   So number one, I have the same exact thing as
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.340]   you, the fake elector scheme is unacceptable,
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.820]   totally disqualifying.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:00.140]   So the fake elector scheme was a literal coup
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:00.900]   attempt.
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:03.420]   So he doesn't win the elections, for folks
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:05.940]   who don't know, I need to explain why it's
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.980]   a coup attempt, because you just throw out
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:09.780]   words and then people get triggered by the
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:11.380]   words and then they go into their separate
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.060]   corners, right?
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:17.020]   So the January 6th rioters, they were not
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:18.540]   going to keep the building.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.980]   That was not a coup attempt.
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:22.700]   It's not like, oh, the MAGA guys have the
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.140]   building, I guess they win, right?
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.860]   No, that was never going to happen.
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:28.980]   So what was the point of the January 6th
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:29.340]   riot?
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.180]   It was to delay the proceedings.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:32.900]   Why did it matter that they were going to
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:33.900]   delay the proceedings?
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:35.900]   Because if you can't certify the election,
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:38.420]   they wanted general confusion and chaos so
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:40.220]   that the Republicans in Congress could say,
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.220]   well, we don't know who won, so we're going
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.740]   to have to kick it back to the States.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:46.180]   In the States, they had the fake electors
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:48.340]   ready, and remember the fake electors are
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.060]   not Trump's electors.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:52.980]   There's both candidates have a slate of
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:54.660]   electors, Biden's electors and Trump's
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:55.060]   electors.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:57.420]   They go to the Trump electors first in this
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:01.740]   plan and half the Trump electors go, no, I'm
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.700]   not going to pretend Trump won the election
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:04.900]   when he didn't win the election.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.780]   So they're like, shit, now we've got to
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.020]   come up with fake electors.
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:08.580]   Okay.
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:10.700]   So they enlist these Republicans to go,
[01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:12.020]   yeah, I'll pretend Trump won.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:12.580]   Right.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:14.660]   And so they sign a piece of paper, that's
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:16.940]   fraud, and that's why a lot of them are now
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:19.340]   being prosecuted in the different States.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.660]   And so the idea is the Republican
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:26.780]   legislature, legislators then go, we're
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.740]   sending these new electors in, and we think
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.460]   Trump won Arizona and Georgia and Wisconsin.
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:33.140]   Right.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:34.260]   That was the idea.
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:35.020]   That was the plan.
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:38.180]   And then you come back to the house at that
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:40.020]   point, when there are two different sets of
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.260]   electors, the rule constitutional rule is
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.900]   the house decides, but the house decides not
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.500]   on a majority because the Democrats had the
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.340]   majority at the time.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.820]   They decide on a majority of the States.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:55.740]   They vote by state and the Republicans had
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.180]   the majority of the States.
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:00.500]   So in that way, you steal the election, even
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.860]   though Trump didn't win, you install him back
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:05.940]   in as president, that is a frontal assault on
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:08.260]   democracy and I loathe it.
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:11.820]   And then Trump on top just blabbers out.
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:14.180]   Well, sometimes you have, if there's massive
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:16.380]   fraud in an election, in other words, I think
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.380]   I won, I don't even think that I'm just
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.220]   saying that I won.
[01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:19.860]   Right.
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:23.500]   He says you can terminate any rule regulation
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:25.300]   or article, even in the constitution.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:27.620]   No brother, you cannot terminate the
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:30.220]   constitution because you'd like to do a fake
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:32.420]   elector scheme and do a coup against America.
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.060]   Fuck you.
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:34.740]   Okay.
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.820]   So I'm never going to allow this want to be
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.220]   tyrant to go back into the white house and
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:42.260]   endanger our system.
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:44.740]   And so you want to endanger the corrupt system.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:45.460]   I'm the guy.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.140]   Okay.
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:48.500]   Let's go get that corrupt system and tear it down.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.660]   If you want to endanger the real system,
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:53.820]   democracy, capitalism, the constitution,
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:55.060]   then I'm your biggest enemy.
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.900]   So I'm never going to take that risk.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:00.100]   And you see it every time he goes to talk
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:00.900]   to a dictator.
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:03.580]   Look, guys, I'm asking you to be principled.
[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:04.260]   Right.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.460]   I asked the left of that and we drive away
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:08.060]   some of our audience when we do that.
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.340]   So we got the balls to do that to our, to
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:11.140]   our own side.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:14.340]   So for the right wing, be honest, if it was
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:17.180]   Joe Biden or Barack Obama or Kamala Harris,
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.780]   that went and wrote quote unquote, love
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.860]   letters to a communist dictator who runs
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:27.980]   concentration camps, you would say communist.
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:28.980]   We knew it.
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.060]   Look at that.
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:31.980]   And Trump literally says about Kim Jong
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:34.020]   Un, we wrote love letters to one another.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:35.980]   I fell, we fell in love.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:38.420]   If a Democrat said that they'd be
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.820]   politically decapitated, right?
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.300]   They, they, their career would be instantly
[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:44.540]   over, right?
[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:47.620]   But Trump, whatever's Xi Jinping, Vladimir
[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:49.260]   Putin, I'm not, don't get into Russia, Russia,
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.300]   Russia, but it's just that he's a strong man.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:51.620]   Right.
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:55.580]   Uh, uh, Kim Jong Un or any, uh, Victor
[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:58.180]   Orban, Duterte in the Philippines.
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:01.620]   Anytime it's a strong man that says,
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:04.060]   screw our constitution, screw our rules.
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:06.980]   I want total loyalty to one person.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:08.340]   Trump loves them.
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:09.700]   He loves them.
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:12.180]   He said once he's like, oh, it's great.
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:13.660]   You go to North Korea or China.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:16.460]   And when the, uh, leader walks in,
[02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:18.740]   everybody applauds and everybody
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:19.820]   listens to what he says.
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:20.860]   That's how we should be here.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:21.460]   No brother.
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.620]   That's not how it should be here.
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:24.220]   You hate democracy.
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:26.420]   You want to be the sole guy in charge.
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.540]   As a populist, you should loathe Donald Trump.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:31.380]   I agree on the fake electric scheme.
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:34.580]   Can you steal man and maybe educate me
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:37.460]   on, um, there's a book rigged that I
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:38.580]   started reading.
[02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:42.500]   Is there any degree to which the election
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.300]   was rigged or elections in general are rigged?
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:47.860]   So I think the book rigged, the main case
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:50.500]   they make is not that there's some, uh, shady
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.380]   fake, uh, ballots.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:55.900]   It's more the impact of mainstream media and
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:57.660]   the impact of a big tech.
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:00.380]   So rigged is another one of those words
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:03.380]   that triggers people and is ill-defined, right?
[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:05.180]   So let's begin to define it.
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:10.620]   So the worst case of rigged is we actually
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:12.060]   changed the votes, right?
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:14.340]   So a lot of Trump people think that that's
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:14.980]   what happened.
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:15.820]   Nonsense.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:16.780]   That didn't happen at all.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:17.380]   Okay.
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:19.100]   So then you move.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:22.260]   And by the way, some on the left thought
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:25.180]   the votes were changed in the 2016 primary
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.180]   and it was literally rigged against Bernie.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:28.580]   No, that did not happen.
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:29.260]   Okay.
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:33.340]   That is a massive crime and is very risky
[02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:35.140]   and is relatively easy to get caught.
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.660]   People who are in power are not interested
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:38.380]   in getting caught.
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.060]   They're not interested in going to jail,
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:40.740]   et cetera.
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:42.540]   It is a very extreme thing.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.260]   Could it happen?
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:44.180]   Yes, it could happen.
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.820]   Have I seen any evidence of it happening
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.060]   in my lifetime?
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:48.820]   Not really.
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:52.620]   Given how much people hate this, you probably
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:55.180]   just need to find evidence of one time.
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:59.900]   Like one vote being changed where you can trace
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.260]   them saying something in some room somewhere
[02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:04.420]   that would just explode.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:06.220]   And just that evidence just doesn't
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:06.940]   seem to be there.
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:08.940]   And by the way, for the right wing who say
[02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:11.420]   verify the vote, goddamn right, verify the vote.
[02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:11.780]   Right?
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:13.540]   So you want to do, have different proposals
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:15.780]   like paper ballots, recounts, hand recounts,
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:18.180]   which by the way, you had not the paper
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.820]   ballots, but the three recounts and a hand
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:22.780]   recount in Georgia and so many of these swing
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:25.180]   States, he lost, he lost, he lost.
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:27.140]   There was no significant voter fraud.
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:30.700]   Now, second thing in terms of, uh, of
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:32.660]   rigging is voter fraud.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.260]   So how, and the right wing believes, oh my
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:36.340]   God, it's voter fraud everywhere.
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:37.460]   Not remotely true.
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.340]   Heritage foundation does a study.
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:41.060]   They want to prove it so badly.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.060]   And it turns out no matter how much
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:44.700]   they move the numbers, the final number
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:53.580]   they got was, it happens 0.000006% of the time.
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:54.540]   Okay.
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.100]   It almost never happens.
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.340]   They found like 31 instances over a
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:59.740]   decade or two decades.
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:00.940]   So it's.
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.860]   Well, what counts as voter fraud?
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:05.260]   So a lot of times these days it'll be
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.980]   Republicans who do it because it'll be,
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:08.100]   and it's not nefarious.
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:10.260]   It's a knucklehead who goes in and he's,
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:11.660]   oh, I heard they are, they're having
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.940]   undocumented illegals vote.
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:15.780]   So I voted for me and my mom, even
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.300]   though she's dead, but that's fair.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:17.980]   They're doing it.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.420]   No brother.
[02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:20.180]   That's not fair.
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:21.540]   That's not how it works.
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:22.540]   You're under arrest.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:24.620]   So what about non-citizens voting?
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.700]   So it's preposterous.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:27.980]   Of course, non-citizens shouldn't
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:29.500]   vote and they don't vote.
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.180]   But there's not, you don't have to prove
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:33.660]   citizenship when you're voting, right?
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:35.140]   No, you do.
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.260]   I mean, so it depends on what you mean
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.220]   by prove and when you vote, right?
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:41.300]   So you're not allowed to vote
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:43.660]   as a undocumented immigrant.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:46.860]   So that happens upfront when you go to,
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:49.100]   like, again, it's a hall of mirrors.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:50.060]   Like there's so many different
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:51.820]   ways to create mirages.
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:54.100]   So the Republicans will say, well, when
[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:55.500]   you go to the voting booth, they don't
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.580]   make you show a passport.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:58.380]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:03:59.940]   But you showed it earlier when
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:01.300]   you registered, right?
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:04.860]   And so, and we can get into voter ID laws.
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:06.100]   There's all sorts of things, but we got
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.820]   to, we'll speed up the spectrum, right?
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.700]   So these things almost never happen.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:12.180]   Voter fraud happens super rarely, uh,
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:13.700]   and not enough to swing elections.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:15.180]   And by the way, sometimes if there
[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:16.700]   is an issue, they'll redo an election.
[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.100]   There is actually a process for that.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.660]   And it happened in North Carolina
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.060]   because Republicans did voter fraud
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.060]   in this one district.
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:22.460]   Okay.
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.060]   And it wasn't the candidate himself.
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:26.380]   It was this campaign person and they
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:29.340]   did ballot harvesting and then, but
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:30.780]   ballot harvesting, again, it depends
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:31.260]   on what you mean.
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:32.340]   If you're just collecting ballots,
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:32.980]   that's okay.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:34.580]   He changed the ballots.
[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:35.700]   That's not okay.
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:37.580]   And so they had to redo that election.
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:41.580]   So, um, now the real place where it gets
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:44.180]   rigged is before elections and there's
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:46.140]   two main ways that things get rigged.
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:50.140]   One is almost exclusively.
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:52.020]   No, that's not fair.
[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:53.140]   I was going to say Republicans, but
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:54.900]   Democrats do it too in a different way.
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:56.660]   So Republicans will come in like Brian
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.220]   Kemp is the king of this in Georgia.
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:00.740]   So he was against Trump doing it ex
[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:01.380]   post facto.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:02.780]   He's like, no, you idiot.
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:04.180]   We don't cheat after the election.
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:05.620]   We cheat before the election.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:06.180]   Okay.
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:07.860]   So they'll go, well, I mean, you got
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:09.220]   to clear out the voter rolls every once
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:09.460]   in a while.
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:11.100]   And that's true because people die,
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:12.180]   people move and you got to
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:13.060]   clean out the voter rolls.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.220]   So then they come in and they go, we
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:17.260]   will clean them out mainly in black areas.
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:18.180]   Okay.
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:19.140]   Oh, look at that.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:20.900]   There goes a couple of million black
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:21.380]   voters.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.540]   Well, some of those I suppose are real
[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:25.740]   voters, but they'll have to re-register
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:27.740]   and then they'll find that out on election
[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:30.540]   day and, oh, well now, sorry, you
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:31.500]   couldn't vote this time.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.300]   Remember to re-register next time.
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:36.220]   And so do they go, Hey, we're going to
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.660]   take black people off the voter rolls.
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:40.340]   No, what they do is we're having more
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:42.900]   issues in these districts, right?
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:44.460]   Here's another way they do it.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:46.980]   How many voting boosts do you have in the
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:47.340]   area?
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:51.060]   So primarily Republican areas will get
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:52.300]   tons of voting boosts.
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:53.580]   So you don't have to wait in line.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.980]   You go in, you vote, you go to work.
[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:56.660]   No problem.
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.980]   You're in a black area run in a, in a
[02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:01.580]   Republican state, all of a sudden, Hey,
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:04.780]   look, that city, well, we sent you four
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:05.540]   voting boosts.
[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:07.020]   Oh, you got a million people there.
[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:07.980]   Well, what are you going to do?
[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:09.220]   I guess you got to wait in line the whole
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:11.260]   day, you can't go to work, et cetera.
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:11.860]   So that's the way.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:15.860]   I refuse to believe it's the, it's, it's
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.780]   only the Republicans that do that.
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:18.620]   I would say.
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:19.860]   So that's why I paused.
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:20.460]   Yeah.
[02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:23.020]   That just seems too obvious to do by both.
[02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:24.540]   Yeah.
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.100]   I know.
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:27.220]   No, the Democrats are so weak.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:29.100]   Like they mainly don't do that, but they
[02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.700]   do do the third thing, which is gerrymandering.
[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.780]   So both Republicans and Democrats.
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:36.300]   Also their favorite flavors of, uh, yeah,
[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:37.700]   of messing with the vote.
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:37.980]   Okay.
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:38.420]   Yeah.
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:41.820]   So gerrymandering is the best way to rig
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:42.420]   an election.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.540]   That way the politicians pick their voters
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:46.380]   instead of the voters picking their politicians.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:47.140]   Right?
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:49.980]   So all these districts are so heavily
[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:52.540]   gerrymandered that the incumbent almost can't
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:52.940]   lose.
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:55.860]   They'll push most of the voters into one
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:57.340]   district, most of the voters in another
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.340]   district because they don't want competition.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:00.820]   Right?
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:04.620]   So there, then you're screwed.
[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:09.900]   They, the vote isn't rigged, but the district
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:13.620]   is rigged so that the incumbent wins no
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:15.140]   matter, almost no matter what.
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:15.540]   Right.
[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:18.380]   So that's why we've gotten so polarized
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:21.740]   because the gerrymandering creates like 90%
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:22.940]   of seats that are safe.
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:24.860]   So they don't have to compromise.
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:26.260]   They don't have to get to a middle.
[02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:29.020]   They could just be extreme on either side
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:30.300]   because they already locked it up.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:31.140]   Okay.
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:32.540]   So that's the number one way to rig an
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:32.980]   election.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.820]   Now, finally, the last part of it is maybe
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:37.700]   the most important, maybe even more important
[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:39.500]   than gerrymandering and that's the media.
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:42.820]   So it just happened to RFK Jr.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:45.580]   It happened to Bernie in 2015.
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:47.940]   It happens to any outsider, right or left.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:50.620]   The media, if you're an outsider will say,
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:54.580]   well, radical, number one, they don't
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:55.700]   platform you, right?
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:56.900]   So they're not going to have you on to
[02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:57.340]   begin with.
[02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:58.740]   Nobody's even going to find out about you.
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:01.100]   If nobody finds out about you, you're done for.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:01.540]   Right?
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:05.820]   So Bernie broke through that because he
[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:09.500]   was so popular and the rallies were so huge
[02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:11.340]   that he, they could, local news couldn't
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.740]   help, but cover him, Jesus Christ.
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:13.900]   What are all these people doing in the
[02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:14.500]   middle of the city?
[02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:14.860]   Right.
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:16.740]   And he slowly broke through that.
[02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:18.700]   But do you know that in 2015, as he's doing
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.540]   this miraculous run against Hillary Clinton,
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:23.860]   nobody thinks he has a chance and here
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:26.180]   comes Bernie and he's almost at 48%.
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:28.820]   This is, he had seven seconds of
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:30.300]   coverage on ABC that year.
[02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:33.420]   They just will not put you on.
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:35.500]   That is the number one way they rig an
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:37.220]   election, Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:40.380]   sitting at 20% in a primary, no town hall,
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:44.220]   20% is a giant number, right?
[02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:45.580]   And you're not going to do a town hall.
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:47.540]   You're not going to do a debate, 12% in
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:49.580]   the general election, a giant number in a
[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:52.300]   general election, no town hall, no debate.
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:55.780]   If no one finds out about you, they don't
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:58.020]   know to vote for you, right?
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:08:59.660]   If they don't find out your policies,
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:02.260]   corporate media rigs elections more than
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:03.420]   anything else in the world.
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:06.380]   Now, this is something you've been a bit
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:08.820]   controversial about, but the general sort of
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:10.860]   standard belief is that there's a left-leaning
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:15.340]   bias in the mainstream media because as I
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:17.540]   think studies show a large majority of
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:21.100]   journalists are left-leaning and then that
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:24.420]   there's a bias in big tech employees of big
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:27.180]   tech companies from search engines to social
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:30.460]   media are left-leaning and there that's a
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:31.900]   huge majority is left-leaning.
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:34.460]   So the conventional wisdom is that there
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:37.140]   is a bias towards the left.
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:38.140]   Yeah.
[02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.100]   So do you think, first of all, I think
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:42.820]   you've argued that that's not true, that
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:47.020]   there's a bias in the other direction, but
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:48.460]   whether there's a bias or not, do you think
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:50.380]   that how big of an impact that has on the
[02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:51.420]   result of the election?
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:52.140]   Okay.
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:53.180]   So let's break that down.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:56.260]   Uh, tech and media are totally different.
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.220]   So let's do media first and we'll do tech.
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:01.260]   So on, uh, mainstream media, corporate media,
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:05.540]   and I actually think that right-wing media
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:07.860]   like Fox news is part of corporate media.
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.260]   They just play good cop, bad cop.
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:13.300]   And so in, in that realm, the bias is not
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.740]   right or left except on social issues.
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:16.140]   Okay.
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:17.820]   So, and that's where that image comes from.
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:20.780]   On social issues, yes, the media is
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:24.140]   generally on the left and right-wing, sorry,
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:26.860]   but like this started in the 1960s and
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:28.780]   the right-wing got super mad at mainstream
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:30.620]   media saying that black people were
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:31.540]   equal to white people.
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:33.260]   That's not the case anymore.
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:33.820]   Okay.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.100]   Right-wing calm down.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.020]   I'm not calling you all racist, but in
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:38.700]   the 1960s, were there racism?
[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:39.340]   Was there racism?
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:40.100]   Of course.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:41.260]   Of course they wouldn't even let black
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:42.300]   kids into the schools, right?
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:43.900]   There was massive segregation in the
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.580]   South, but a lot in the North as well.
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:47.260]   And at that point in mainstream media
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:49.820]   says, well, I mean, they are citizens.
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:51.700]   They should have equal rights.
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:54.540]   And the right-wing goes bias.
[02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:55.860]   Okay.
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:56.020]   Yeah.
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:56.820]   I mean, you're kind of right.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:57.620]   It is a bias.
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.620]   It is a bias towards equality in that case.
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:02.140]   Uh, but it, that is perceived as on the left.
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:05.820]   Now, fast forward to today, you don't have
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:08.020]   that on the racial issues as obviously as
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:10.540]   much as you had it back then, but on gay
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:13.140]   marriage that existed for a long time
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.420]   where the media is like, well, they kind
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:17.380]   of should have the same rights as straight
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:18.060]   people, right?
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:20.940]   And the right-wing went bias, right?
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:22.220]   So, okay.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:23.300]   You're kind of right about that.
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:24.860]   But at the same time, I would argue
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:28.100]   their position is correct, right?
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:30.140]   So, but can they go too far?
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:31.260]   Of course they can go too far.
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:31.780]   Okay.
[02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:34.540]   Now, but that's not the main deal guys.
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:35.940]   That's to distract you.
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:38.300]   The main deal is economic issues.
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:40.740]   And again, we say it ahead of time and you
[02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:42.380]   can see if we're right or wrong, right?
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:45.340]   So we will tell folks when we get to an
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.940]   economic bill, you will see all of a
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:49.300]   sudden, the guys who theoretically
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:52.580]   disagree, Fox news and MSNBC close ranks.
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.300]   And you just saw it happen with price
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:56.100]   gouging, that issue of price gouging.
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:58.140]   All of a sudden there's a lot of MSNBC
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:00.700]   hosts, CNN hosts, Washington Post writes
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:02.700]   an op-ed against it and everybody panics.
[02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:04.300]   It was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:05.860]   you can't control anything a corporation
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:06.060]   does.
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:06.740]   This is wrong.
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.460]   This is wrong.
[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:07.820]   Right?
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:08.700]   Oh, what happened?
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:10.180]   I thought you guys were hated each other.
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:11.820]   All of a sudden you totally agree.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:12.780]   Fascinating.
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:13.460]   Okay.
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:16.220]   Same thing happened on increasing wages
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:17.380]   when they were talking about increasing
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:19.620]   the minimum wage, Stephanie ruled giant
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:21.500]   screed against it on MSNBC.
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.900]   All of a sudden Fox news and MSNBC agree.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:24.620]   Right.
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:27.060]   Do not touch beloved corporations.
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.380]   So now that gets us to our real bias.
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:30.900]   It's not left or right.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:33.700]   It's pro corporate for all the reasons
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:35.860]   we talked about before, corporate media,
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:37.140]   corporate politicians.
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.740]   So if you don't believe me today, whether
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:43.300]   you're on the right or the left watch next
[02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.820]   time, an economic issue, where do they fall?
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:47.020]   How do they react?
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:50.220]   When anytime it's a corporate, uh, issue,
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.340]   where does the media go?
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:51.740]   Right?
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:53.780]   So that's the real bias of the media.
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:55.500]   And so since the real bias of the
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.260]   media is pro corporations, that is not
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:00.140]   a left-wing position that is considered
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:01.420]   more of a right-wing position.
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:03.580]   I even think that's a misnomer because
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:05.500]   to be fair to right-wing voters, they're
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:06.820]   not pro corporations.
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:08.180]   They're not pro big business.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:10.020]   They're not pro corruption, but the
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:11.260]   Republican politicians are.
[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:13.340]   So it gets framed as a right-wing issue.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:13.700]   Right?
[02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:16.140]   So if you think that they, that the
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.860]   corporate media is too populist,
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:19.980]   you just don't get it.
[02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:22.260]   They aren't, they aren't, they hate populism.
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:26.820]   So now when you turn to tech, so tech's a
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.740]   complicated one because yeah, people write
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:31.940]   the code, if they're left-wingers, they're
[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:33.820]   going to have certain assumptions and
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:35.140]   they're, they might write that into
[02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:36.220]   the codes or the rules.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:40.380]   And so, but they're also generally
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:43.620]   speaking wealthy, they're usually
[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:45.420]   white, they're usually male.
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:47.460]   And those biases also get, go in.
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.020]   And there's a lot of people on the left
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:50.980]   who object to that bias, right?
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:51.700]   Okay.
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:52.980]   But that's a fair and interesting
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:54.820]   conversation and one we have to be
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:56.460]   careful of and when we could find them,
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.860]   hopefully find a middle ground on, but
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:13:59.900]   that's not the major problem.
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:02.740]   The major reason why big tech gets
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:05.500]   attacked is because they are competitors
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:08.140]   of who, social media competes
[02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.980]   with mainstream media.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:13.020]   So mainstream media has been attacking
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:16.580]   big tech from day one, pretending that
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:19.220]   it's a, they're really concerned.
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:19.420]   Yeah.
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:21.980]   They're really concerned because that's
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:23.180]   their competition and they're getting
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:24.180]   their ass handed to them.
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:27.500]   So I did a story on the Young Turks about
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:31.300]   CNN article about all the dangers of social
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:35.060]   media, I'm like, guys, this is written by
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:36.380]   their advertising department.
[02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:36.940]   Okay.
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:38.900]   And they advertise, and they, in fact,
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:40.620]   they go to the advertisers and they find
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:43.540]   a rando video on YouTube or Facebook, right.
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:44.820]   Out of billions of videos.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:47.460]   And they're like, look at your ad is on this
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:50.500]   video, do you denounce and reject every
[02:14:50.500 --> 02:14:52.900]   big tech company and every member of social
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:55.660]   media and the advertisers is like, shit.
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:57.220]   Yeah, I do.
[02:14:57.220 --> 02:14:57.660]   Right.
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:01.340]   Meanwhile, they're doing Milf Island on TV.
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:03.020]   Okay.
[02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:04.060]   I didn't know that.
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:07.540]   There's literally a show that came out
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:10.740]   recently where it's moms and their sons
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:11.700]   and they fuck each other.
[02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:12.740]   Oh, wow.
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:13.420]   Okay.
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:16.220]   They don't, they don't have sex with their mom.
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.940]   They have sex with a different mom or they
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:21.100]   date, but then the show is, oh, then they go
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:22.620]   off into a corner, et cetera.
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:22.980]   Right.
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:25.900]   I'm like, you're doing this kind of like
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:28.780]   the worst degrading, ridiculous, immoral
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:31.380]   programming, and then you found a video on
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:32.500]   YouTube that has a problem.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:33.780]   Get the fuck out of here.
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:35.940]   You're just trying to kneecap your competition.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:38.820]   Let's talk about the saga of Joe Biden.
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:41.660]   So over the past year, over the past few
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:44.580]   months, can you just rewind where, where
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:48.580]   have you, maybe tell the story of Joe Biden
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:51.020]   as you see from the election perspective?
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:52.540]   Yeah.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:56.460]   So about a year ago, I, I I'm looking at the
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:00.500]   polling and first of all, I have eyes, right?
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:01.060]   And ears.
[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:03.460]   So whenever I see Biden, I'm like, this is a
[02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:06.700]   disaster, and then I go and talk to real people.
[02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:09.100]   And when I say real people, I mean, not in
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.700]   politics, that's not their job, right?
[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:12.580]   Because people involved in politics for media
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:16.460]   have a certain perspective and it's colored
[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:19.740]   by all of the exchanges in mainstream media,
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:20.660]   social media, et cetera.
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:25.140]   Real people aren't on Twitter having political
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:28.420]   fights, they're not watching CNN religiously,
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:28.900]   et cetera.
[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:30.780]   Whenever I was at a barbecue, you guys all
[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:32.500]   Democrats and some barbecues.
[02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:33.020]   Yeah.
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:34.780]   Uh, what do you guys think of Joe Biden?
[02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:38.900]   Like almost in unison, too old.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.180]   Every real person said too old.
[02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:43.420]   So I look at what real people are saying.
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:44.740]   That's why I thought Trump was going to win in
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:47.460]   2016, I go in the middle of Ohio, I can't see
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:49.540]   a Hillary Clinton sign for hundreds of miles.
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:49.940]   Right.
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:53.380]   It's Trump paraphernalia everywhere, right?
[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:56.060]   So that's not end all be all, you could say
[02:16:56.060 --> 02:16:58.020]   it's anecdotal, but you begin to collect data
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:16:58.900]   points, right?
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:01.420]   But then the real data points are in polling.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:02.140]   Okay.
[02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:03.500]   So now I'm looking at Biden polling.
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:07.300]   He's in the thirties, no incumbent in the
[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.980]   thirties has ever come back to win.
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:11.540]   So I'm like, it's already over.
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:13.900]   Then all of a sudden, Oh my God, Trump
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:15.540]   takes the lead with Latinos.
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:19.180]   It's, it's double over by the later in the
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:21.980]   process, Trump took the lead with young voters.
[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:24.420]   I'm like, this is the most over election in
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:28.020]   history and Democrat cannot win if they're
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:29.380]   not winning young voters.
[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:30.700]   That's impossible.
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:32.740]   Trump's cutting into his lead with black
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:35.620]   voters, this thing is over.
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:36.060]   Right.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.500]   And I go tell people and they're like,
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.340]   you're crazy.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.020]   Why do they think I'm crazy?
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:44.100]   Cause MSNBC is lying to them 24/7 telling
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:47.380]   them that Joe Biden, uh, created sliced
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:49.460]   bread and the wheel and fire.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:52.140]   And by the, and my favorite talking point
[02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:54.580]   was he's a dynamo behind the scenes.
[02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:56.100]   Yeah.
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:57.500]   I'm like, okay, let me get this right.
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:17:58.580]   It's like an SNL skit.
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:17:58.940]   Right.
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:01.740]   I'm like, so behind the scenes is like,
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.420]   all right, Sally, get me the memo on that.
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:03.900]   And we're okay.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:04.580]   We're going to do this.
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:05.740]   And I'm in command of the material.
[02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:07.020]   Then he goes in front of the cameras.
[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:11.060]   Anyways, why would any politician do that?
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:13.860]   Why, why would they be terrible in front
[02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:15.700]   of the camera and great off camera?
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:16.660]   That doesn't make any sense.
[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:20.260]   But once you get people enough propaganda
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:23.180]   and MSNBC created blue maca, right.
[02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:24.380]   They'll believe anything.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:26.940]   So they believe that Biden was dynamic
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:30.260]   and young and that he was the best
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:32.020]   possible candidate to beat Donald Trump.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:34.180]   When in reality, he was about the only
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.900]   Democrat who couldn't beat Donald Trump.
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:39.980]   So number one, I don't cosign on a bullshit.
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.820]   I don't care which side you're on.
[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:45.660]   Number two, as you heard earlier, I
[02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:46.660]   can't have Trump winning.
[02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:47.900]   It endangers the country.
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:50.380]   It endangers our constitution, et cetera.
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:52.660]   So I'm going to do something about it.
[02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:54.540]   And so I start something called the
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:56.460]   Operation Hope on the Young Turks.
[02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:59.740]   And we asked the audience, what should we do?
[02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:00.100]   Right.
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:01.780]   So there's different projects in Operation
[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:03.940]   Hope and, but the first project that pops
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:06.780]   up is knock Biden out of the race.
[02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:07.540]   Okay.
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:10.940]   And so then I ask our paying members on
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:13.540]   TYT, I say, guys, you're going to vote.
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:15.180]   And then I'm going to do what you tell me to do.
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.700]   If you say, no, I like Biden, or I think
[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:20.420]   Biden's the best candidate, or even if he
[02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:21.820]   isn't, we're not going to be able to win
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:22.820]   on this, so don't do it.
[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:23.300]   Right.
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:25.620]   Should I enter the primary against Biden?
[02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:26.620]   Okay.
[02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:30.300]   76, 24, go enter.
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:30.700]   Right.
[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:32.460]   I'm a populist.
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:33.820]   You tell me to go, you're my paying
[02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:34.860]   members, you're my boss.
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:35.660]   I'm going to go.
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:36.380]   Okay.
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:37.700]   So I enter the primary.
[02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:40.100]   Now I'm not born in the country, so people
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:41.300]   are going to freak out about that.
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:42.500]   I'm a talk show host.
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:47.460]   Like the establishment media despises me.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:48.020]   Right.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:49.740]   So I'm not going to get any air time.
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:52.460]   In fact, we consider hiring the top
[02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:54.860]   booking agent in New York.
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:57.260]   We talked to him and he says, well, you
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:58.860]   know, I'm actually in New York this week.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:00.820]   And he says, I'm going to go talk to those
[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:03.380]   guys and I'll come, I'll come back to you.
[02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:05.660]   And he was really decent because normally,
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:08.420]   you know, he charges a lot, just take the
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:08.980]   money, right?
[02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:10.300]   And go, oh yeah, yeah, I'll get you on.
[02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:11.460]   But he was a wonderful guy.
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:13.220]   He said, I talked to them, you're banned.
[02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:14.780]   So don't, don't do it.
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:17.340]   Like you're not, you're banned at CNN,
[02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:19.700]   you're banned at MSNBC, and I think you're
[02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:21.220]   banned on Fox News, but I'm not sure.
[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:21.860]   Okay.
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:26.100]   So, so long odds, why do you do it?
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:28.380]   Because if you think we're going to crash
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:30.860]   into the iceberg, you might as well
[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:33.180]   bum rush the captain's course, right?
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:34.500]   I'm lunging at the wheel.
[02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:36.660]   So what difference can I make?
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:38.580]   Well, I can make a difference by going on
[02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:40.820]   every show on planet earth and going, he's
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:43.260]   too old, he's in the thirties, he has no
[02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:44.940]   chance of winning, no chance of winning.
[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:47.500]   I go on Charlemagne's show, Breakfast Club,
[02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:50.060]   right, Charlemagne agrees, all of a sudden
[02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:52.340]   we're having buzz and then people go, oh,
[02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:54.340]   Charlemagne said he has no chance of winning.
[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:56.180]   Then Charlemagne's on the Daily
[02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:57.260]   Show, talks to Jon Stewart.
[02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:58.820]   Jon Stewart does a segment, not, this is
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:01.020]   not necessarily causal, but buzz is building.
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:01.420]   Right?
[02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:03.300]   So then Jon Stewart does a segment, if
[02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:04.940]   you remember, and people got super pissed
[02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:07.380]   at him, too old, can't win, and all,
[02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:08.340]   and that buzz is building.
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:11.900]   Meanwhile, unrelated to us, David Axelrod
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:14.260]   and James Carville, and I'm like, guys,
[02:21:14.260 --> 02:21:17.020]   figure it out, who does Axelrod speak for?
[02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:20.100]   The top advisor for Barack Obama.
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:22.020]   Who is James Carville the top
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:22.780]   advisor for?
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:23.820]   The Clintons.
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:26.100]   This is the Clintons and the Obama's
[02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:28.700]   sending their emissaries to say, we can
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:32.180]   read a poll, he's going to lose, change
[02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:34.620]   direction, so when the debate happens,
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:36.180]   we laid the groundwork.
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:39.820]   If we hadn't laid the groundwork, debate
[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:41.500]   would have been the first time that Blue
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:43.300]   Maga would have thought, oh, maybe Biden
[02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:44.500]   can't win, right?
[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:47.020]   But since all of us said it and strange
[02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:50.380]   bad fellows, I loathe Nancy Pelosi, but
[02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:51.340]   she was on our side.
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:53.100]   I got a lot of issues with Bill Maher.
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:54.660]   He was on our side, right?
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:57.180]   I got a lot of issues with Axelrod and
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:58.580]   Carville and they were on our side.
[02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:01.340]   So the people who believed in objective
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:04.940]   reality kind of independently made a plan.
[02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.940]   Let's show people objective reality.
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:09.780]   And we did, and we drove them out and
[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:10.980]   it made all the difference.
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:13.300]   So you think he stepped down voluntarily
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:14.300]   or was he forced out?
[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:15.700]   Both.
[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:18.020]   So again, it depends on what you mean.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:19.980]   So was he forced out?
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:21.140]   Of course he was forced out.
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:22.900]   You think he just woke up and he's like,
[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:24.420]   oh yeah, you know what?
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:25.820]   Screw my legacy.
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:27.140]   I don't want to be a two term president.
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:28.780]   I'll just drop out for no reason.
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:29.820]   No, we forced them out.
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:30.460]   Of course we did.
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:30.820]   Right.
[02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:33.220]   And when I say we, I had a tiny, tiny,
[02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:35.020]   tiny role, the people who had the major
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:37.260]   roles, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:40.220]   all those folks, but even they were not
[02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:41.940]   the main driving force.
[02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:43.460]   The number one driving force were the
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:47.060]   donors, what is the source of power of
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:49.380]   Bernie or Massey, the people, right?
[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:51.300]   What is the source of power for Biden?
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.700]   The donors, the donors made Biden.
[02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:56.220]   He is the donors candidate and the donors.
[02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:58.060]   That's why he told the donors, nothing
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:00.380]   will fundamentally change that.
[02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:04.580]   Like you can, if you say Lex, no Jenk,
[02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:06.660]   I think you're too extreme that Biden
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:08.100]   works for the donors, 98%.
[02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:10.940]   I think he only works for them 80% or 55%.
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:11.620]   Fine.
[02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:13.780]   We could have that debate, but you can't
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:16.140]   argue that it isn't his source of power.
[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:18.180]   And you can't argue it anymore, even if
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:19.740]   you're going to argue it earlier, because
[02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:21.340]   once the donors said, we're not giving
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:23.620]   you any more money, he didn't have any options.
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:25.620]   He couldn't, he couldn't go on.
[02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:28.260]   So, but was he forced out at like
[02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:29.540]   knife point or something?
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:30.060]   No.
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:31.140]   So was it voluntary?
[02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:31.380]   Yeah.
[02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:33.820]   Ultimately, if Biden decided to stay in,
[02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:35.220]   there was nothing we could do about it.
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:37.700]   And so he had to voluntarily make that
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:39.740]   decision, but he voluntarily made it
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:41.340]   because he had no choice left.
[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:41.940]   Yeah.
[02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:45.740]   I wish he stepped down voluntarily
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:47.020]   from a place of strength.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:51.420]   So I think, I think presidents, I
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:54.660]   think politicians in general, especially
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:56.260]   at the highest levels want legacy.
[02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:59.060]   And to me, at least one of the greatest
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.220]   things you could do is to walk away
[02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:03.940]   from the, at the top, I mean, George
[02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:05.940]   Washington, to walk away from power.
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:08.540]   It's, I think universally respected,
[02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:09.900]   especially if you've got a good speech
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:12.620]   to go with it and you do it really well.
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:16.220]   Not as some kind of cynical or a
[02:24:16.220 --> 02:24:18.780]   calculator, some kind of a transactional
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.220]   way, but just like as a great leader and
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:23.180]   maybe be a little bit even more dramatic
[02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:24.700]   than you need to be in doing it.
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:25.340]   Yeah.
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:26.460]   I thought, I thought that would be a
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:30.860]   beautiful moment and then launch a, some
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:35.700]   kind of democratic process for electing
[02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:36.540]   a different option.
[02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:38.820]   Not only did I agree with you a hundred
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:42.860]   percent, I reached one of the, his top
[02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:44.380]   advisors, one of the guys you see in the
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:46.940]   press all the time, as in his, in his
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:49.220]   inner circle, I never said that before
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:50.820]   because we were in the middle of it and
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:52.380]   I'm never going to betray anyone's
[02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:54.220]   confidence and I'll never say who's, who
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:54.700]   it was.
[02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:55.220]   Okay.
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:58.860]   But he was gracious enough to meet with
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:01.980]   me as I was about to enter the primary.
[02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:04.460]   And look, it's smart too, because get
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:06.380]   information, intelligence, et cetera.
[02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:07.940]   Is this guy going to be trouble or not
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:08.700]   trouble, right?
[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:10.500]   But at least he took the meeting.
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:12.620]   And the case I made is exactly the one
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:13.540]   you just said, Lex.
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:15.420]   I said, if he drops, this is about 10
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:17.580]   months ago, I said, if he drops out now,
[02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:21.020]   they build statues of him, right?
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:22.700]   The Democrats, if you're a right winger,
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:23.500]   you hate him, I get it.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:26.500]   But the Democrats would have said he beat
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:28.580]   Trump and protected democracy in 2020.
[02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:31.780]   And he steps down graciously now to make
[02:25:31.780 --> 02:25:34.900]   sure we beat Trump again in 2024 and he
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:37.420]   lets go of power voluntarily.
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:40.340]   You're he's going to be a hero, an absolute
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:43.580]   hero, but if he doesn't, you're going to
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:46.380]   force all of us to kick the living crap out
[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:49.140]   of him and tell everybody he's an egomaniac,
[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:51.460]   which he is, and he's doing this for two,
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:52.980]   so that he could be, if you don't know
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:55.260]   Washington in that bubble, if you're a
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:57.100]   one-term president, you're a loser.
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:59.580]   If you're a two-term president, you
[02:25:59.580 --> 02:26:01.460]   have a legacy and you're historic.
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:03.940]   He's running for one reason, one reason
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:08.060]   only, my legacy, I will be a two-term
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:09.860]   president, I will be considered historic.
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:12.300]   I'm like, brother, now you're going to
[02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:14.300]   be considered the villain, the villain of
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:15.940]   the story, you're handing it right back to
[02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:17.540]   Trump, you're not going to win.
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:20.100]   And you know, look at the numbers, any
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:22.020]   political professional knows you're not
[02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:22.420]   going to win.
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:25.380]   So you have hero or villain and you get
[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:26.700]   to choose, but if you think you're going
[02:26:26.700 --> 02:26:28.580]   to be a hero and beat Trump, that is not
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:29.340]   a choice you have.
[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:30.380]   That is not going to happen.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:32.740]   And they didn't believe us, but by
[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:33.540]   then they did.
[02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:37.620]   Were you troubled by the, um, how
[02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:40.620]   Kamala Harris was selected after you
[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:41.140]   stepped down?
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:41.940]   Yes and no.
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:45.780]   So I argued for an open convention.
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:49.940]   And so if Biden had stepped down when we
[02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:53.020]   were trying to get people into the primary,
[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:55.020]   knock him out, then it would, that would
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:26:56.060]   have been a perfect solution.
[02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:57.820]   Then all the governors could go in,
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:00.860]   Walls, Beshear, Whitmer, Kamala Harris
[02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:02.380]   goes in, obviously they have a real
[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:05.340]   primary at that point, me later, Dean
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:07.860]   Phillips came in, me, Dean, and I mean,
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:08.740]   Mary, I wouldn't drop out.
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:10.260]   Me and Dean would definitely drop out
[02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:11.900]   because our whole point was get other
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:13.460]   people in the race, make sure we win.
[02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:13.900]   Right.
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:15.420]   So, okay.
[02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:17.060]   Then you would have had a great primary.
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:18.500]   It would have been the right way to do
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:21.140]   it, both morally, you know, constitutionally,
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:22.900]   et cetera, but also as a matter of
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:24.140]   politics, because you would have gotten
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:25.900]   a lot of coverage for your young,
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:28.620]   exciting candidates, uh, and you would
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:30.300]   have legitimized the idea that you're
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:31.300]   protecting democracy.
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:31.740]   Okay.
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:32.860]   So that didn't happen because of
[02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:34.180]   Biden, it is what it is.
[02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:36.820]   So now when Biden drops out, at least
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:38.860]   do a vestige of democracy, go to the
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:40.540]   commission and do what it's designed to
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:42.260]   do, which is pick a candidate.
[02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:44.980]   Ezra Klein made a great case for this in
[02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:47.220]   the New York Times podcast that he did.
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:49.500]   That made a huge difference and he
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:50.460]   was great for doing that.
[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:52.580]   So I believe in an open commission,
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:54.340]   but I know Democrats.
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:56.180]   They love to anoint because they
[02:27:56.180 --> 02:27:57.100]   don't trust the people.
[02:27:57.100 --> 02:28:00.660]   So they think the elites are, uh, geniuses.
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:02.340]   Don't worry, we'll pick the right candidate.
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:02.740]   Yeah.
[02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:03.980]   I remember when you picked Hillary
[02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:05.020]   Clinton, had that work out.
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:05.740]   Right.
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:07.220]   And I remember when you said Joe Biden
[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:08.700]   was the right candidate in 2024.
[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:09.420]   How'd that work out?
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:10.420]   Do not anoint.
[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:11.180]   Right.
[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:13.900]   So, but in the end they didn't.
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:17.340]   So what happened was Biden does the first
[02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:20.300]   announcement, he either forgot or on
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:22.260]   purpose, didn't put Kamala Harris in there.
[02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:24.340]   So there's all this kumbaya now.
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:25.900]   Nah, they don't like each other.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:26.460]   Okay.
[02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:27.860]   And Biden's been screwing her over the
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:29.900]   entire time she's been vice president.
[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:32.060]   So he doesn't put her in the original
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:34.340]   statement and I'm like, Whoa, I do a live
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:34.940]   video immediate.
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:36.420]   I'm like, Kamala Harris is not in the
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:36.860]   statement.
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:37.140]   Right.
[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:39.220]   In the middle of my video, they put out a
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:40.980]   second one going, okay, okay, fine.
[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:41.620]   Kamala Harris.
[02:28:41.620 --> 02:28:41.900]   Right.
[02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:43.900]   Cause that's too much for the president
[02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:44.460]   not to endorse.
[02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:47.220]   You think he was like really like somebody
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:49.820]   like stormed into the room and said, you
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:50.620]   absolutely must.
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:51.580]   I don't know.
[02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:53.300]   I wasn't there, but probably.
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:54.020]   Right.
[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:55.060]   Or they plan.
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:55.580]   I don't know.
[02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:58.220]   But the bottom line is it was glaring that
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:28:59.820]   he didn't put her in the first letter.
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:00.580]   Okay.
[02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:02.500]   So he had to put her in the second one.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:02.860]   Fine.
[02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:03.380]   No problem.
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:07.540]   But Obama Pelosi is show Schumer did
[02:29:07.540 --> 02:29:08.940]   not endorse Kamala Harris.
[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:10.980]   That's huge.
[02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:13.140]   Normally the Democrats would all endorse
[02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:15.100]   her and would all say she's anointed.
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:16.260]   Shut up everybody.
[02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:19.300]   And then MSNBC would scream, shut up, shut
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:20.460]   up, she's anointed.
[02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:20.820]   Right.
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:22.340]   But they didn't do that.
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:24.980]   So then Kamala Harris had to win over the
[02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.300]   delegates and I thought she would win them
[02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:29.340]   over in the convention, but she locked
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:31.700]   them up in two days and she, I know,
[02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:33.860]   cause I know delegates cause I ran and the
[02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:35.900]   delegates are calling me saying, she's on,
[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:37.900]   she's getting on a zoom right now with us.
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:38.260]   Right.
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:40.980]   She went to all the States and worked her
[02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:44.300]   ass off and locked up enough delegates to
[02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:46.980]   get the, to get the nomination in two days.
[02:29:46.980 --> 02:29:47.340]   Yeah.
[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:50.540]   But come on, it's Biden endorsed.
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:51.460]   Of course.
[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:52.500]   So why is that?
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:57.020]   And of course, why not say, uh, sort of layout
[02:29:57.020 --> 02:30:00.260]   walls and Shapiro and Kamala Harris and the
[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:02.300]   options that say, let's like at least the
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:05.460]   facade of democracy, of a democratic process.
[02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:08.020]   There's what should happen and what is
[02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:08.820]   likely to happen.
[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:11.620]   So should Biden not have endorsed?
[02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:12.740]   Yeah, of course.
[02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:15.260]   I think Biden should have done the same
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:17.140]   thing as Obama and Pelosi and sit, not
[02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:19.260]   endorsed and say, Hey, we'd love to have a
[02:30:19.260 --> 02:30:20.820]   process where we figure out who the right
[02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:21.460]   nominee is.
[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:22.860]   And at that point, I'm really worried about
[02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:24.820]   Kamala Harris because she's doing word
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:25.780]   salads nonstop.
[02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:26.260]   Right.
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:28.620]   So I'm like, don't make the same mistake we
[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:31.180]   did before and just pick someone out of a hat,
[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:33.060]   test them, test them.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:35.220]   You get stronger candidates when you test
[02:30:35.220 --> 02:30:38.100]   them, the authoritarian nature of the DNC
[02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:39.740]   drives me crazy.
[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:42.260]   They don't believe in testing candidates.
[02:30:42.260 --> 02:30:43.620]   They don't believe in letting their own
[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:44.460]   voters decide.
[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:46.300]   And look, when we were in the primary, they
[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.420]   canceled the Florida election and then, and
[02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:51.300]   they took me, Dean and Marianne off the
[02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:52.900]   ballot in North Carolina and Tennessee.
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:54.540]   I'm like, guys, if you're going to make a
[02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:56.540]   case for democracy in the general election,
[02:30:57.180 --> 02:30:59.500]   and you cancel elections in the primaries,
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:02.940]   do you not get how ridiculous you look,
[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:04.500]   how hypocritical you look?
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:05.100]   Right.
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:07.500]   So I didn't want them to Biden to endorse
[02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:10.900]   anyone, but I'm shocked that they didn't all
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:13.020]   endorse her because normally what happens
[02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:13.980]   is they all endorse.
[02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:18.380]   So bottom line Lex is, did she like earning
[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:19.340]   in a perfect system?
[02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:20.220]   Not even close.
[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:20.620]   Right.
[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:23.820]   But did she earn it enough in this imperfect
[02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.660]   way where at least she showed some degree of
[02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:29.380]   competence that assuaged my concerns?
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:30.180]   Yes.
[02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:33.100]   So, because a normal Democrat would bungle
[02:31:33.100 --> 02:31:34.900]   that, they wouldn't go talk like Hillary
[02:31:34.900 --> 02:31:36.580]   Clinton, wouldn't talk to the delegates.
[02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:39.340]   She would assume that she's the queen and
[02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:40.980]   that they would all bow their heads.
[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:42.940]   She would, you know, so the fact that she
[02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:46.060]   did elementary politics, correct, for
[02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:47.420]   Democrats, it's like a big win.
[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:50.580]   It just really frustrated me because, uh,
[02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:55.220]   it smelled of the same thing of fucking over
[02:31:55.220 --> 02:32:00.260]   Bernie in 2015, 16 and RFK and just the
[02:32:00.260 --> 02:32:01.860]   anointing aspect.
[02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:04.580]   Now they seem to have gotten lucky in this
[02:32:04.580 --> 02:32:07.020]   situation that it's very possible that Kamala
[02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:08.300]   Harris would have been selected through a
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:09.420]   democratic process.
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:11.740]   But I have to say, listening to the speeches
[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:15.020]   of the DNC, Walz was amazing.
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:18.380]   Uh, Shapiro was really strong and Kamala
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:20.380]   actually was much better as compared to her
[02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:22.660]   as a candidate previously, but personally
[02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:24.020]   don't think she would have been the result
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:25.260]   of a democratic process.
[02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:27.540]   So you don't often give your opinions, but
[02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:29.540]   when you give the opinions, I actually agree
[02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:31.780]   90, like a huge percentage of the time in
[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:32.580]   this conversation.
[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:35.980]   So I fought for Shapiro in the primary and
[02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:37.860]   when she was trying to pick for a VP, cause
[02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:39.060]   I thought there's no way she's going to pick
[02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:39.460]   Walz.
[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:41.860]   He's way too, not just progressive, but more
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:42.860]   importantly populist.
[02:32:42.860 --> 02:32:43.260]   Right.
[02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:45.100]   So I didn't think she'd go in that direction
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:47.180]   and Shapiro actually did a bunch of populist
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:47.940]   things in Pennsylvania.
[02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:49.540]   That's part of the reason why he's so popular
[02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:50.620]   in Pennsylvania.
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:52.860]   He looks like a smooth talking politician,
[02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:54.260]   but his actions are pretty good.
[02:32:54.260 --> 02:32:57.300]   And so Shapiro was great.
[02:32:57.300 --> 02:32:58.380]   Walz was great.
[02:32:58.380 --> 02:32:59.860]   The Obamas are legendary.
[02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:02.420]   Even Clinton at his advanced age makes
[02:33:02.420 --> 02:33:04.860]   terrific points in a speech where you go, well,
[02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:06.340]   that one's hard to argue with.
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:06.820]   Right.
[02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:10.260]   And so they all, I'm shocked at the
[02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:12.980]   competence of the DNC, shocked at it, but of
[02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:15.860]   all those likes, so you can give a good speech
[02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:19.220]   and the Obamas give a mean speech, but I saw
[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:20.260]   Obama as president.
[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:22.220]   You know, he didn't deliver on that.
[02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:26.540]   So, but the one guy that stood out is Walz.
[02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:29.820]   And the reason is because he's a real person.
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:30.140]   Yeah.
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:31.780]   Real person, populist.
[02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:34.020]   We all got to work towards picking the
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:35.460]   most genuine candidates.
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:38.060]   So here, uh, on the right wing side, for
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:40.740]   example, I would prefer a Marjorie Taylor
[02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:43.220]   Greene to a Mitch McConnell any day.
[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:45.260]   Marjorie Taylor Greene is genuine.
[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:48.740]   She, uh, she might be genuinely Nazi, but I
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:49.940]   don't agree with her.
[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:52.660]   She might be even more right wing than others,
[02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:54.580]   but I believe that she means it.
[02:33:54.580 --> 02:33:58.460]   And I'll take that any day over a fraud
[02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:00.940]   corporatist like Mitch McConnell, who's just
[02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:02.580]   going to do what his donors command of him,
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:03.060]   et cetera.
[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:06.380]   I got to ask you, cause I also love Bernie
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:07.020]   still got it.
[02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:08.380]   I love Bernie.
[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:09.140]   I always have.
[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:12.140]   Um, I enjoyed his, I think he might still do
[02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:13.860]   it, but I enjoyed his conversations with Tom
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:14.380]   Hartman.
[02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:15.700]   He's a genuine one.
[02:34:16.140 --> 02:34:18.980]   Like Bernie, even if you disagree with him,
[02:34:18.980 --> 02:34:20.380]   that's a genuine human being.
[02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:21.460]   Yep.
[02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:23.260]   So just talk about that.
[02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:25.940]   Is it troubling you that he's been fucked
[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:30.380]   over in 2015, 16, and again, 2020, he seems
[02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:34.660]   to be, and why does it keep like forgiving people?
[02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:35.500]   Yeah.
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:39.620]   So I love Bernie for the same reason you were
[02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:41.100]   saying it because he's a real person.
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:41.900]   He's a populist.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:42.580]   He means it.
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:44.220]   And that is so rare in politics.
[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:47.380]   He's, I feel like I'm Diogenes and I went
[02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:49.620]   looking for the one honest man and found it
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:50.100]   in Bernie.
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:53.940]   And so I did a video in 2013 saying Bernie
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:55.780]   Sanders can beat Hillary Clinton in a primary
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:57.700]   in 2013.
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:01.500]   That video exists because why did I think
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:03.500]   that I didn't say it of any of the corporate
[02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:05.180]   politicians and the guys who were supposed to
[02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:08.260]   challenge her and stuff because populist and
[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:09.420]   honest, right.
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:11.540]   And the country's dying for an honest
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:12.860]   populist dying for it.
[02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:13.380]   Right.
[02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:14.900]   So love the brother.
[02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:17.180]   Now that doesn't mean that he's right on
[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:20.860]   strategy and he drives me crazy on strategy.
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:24.660]   So two elements of that, number one in 2016
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:27.940]   and in 2020, for God's sake, attack your
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:28.500]   opponent.
[02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:30.540]   You said something about Trump that I
[02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:34.340]   disagree with, uh, where I'm defending Trump.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:35.020]   Okay.
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:37.380]   You don't like what he did to the public
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:37.980]   discourse.
[02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:38.900]   No, I don't mind it.
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:41.140]   Because I would, and I'll tell you why.
[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:41.460]   Yeah.
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:45.860]   Because at least he got a little bit past
[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:48.300]   the fakeness, like he's a con man and he's
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:49.340]   a fraud overall.
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:50.860]   And he does everything for his own interest,
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:52.580]   but at least he doesn't speak like a
[02:35:52.580 --> 02:35:53.700]   bullshitting politician.
[02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:54.500]   Right.
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:58.180]   And he's not wrong that you have to bully
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:00.700]   your own party to amass enough power to get
[02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:01.420]   things done.
[02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:03.580]   And he showed that that's possible.
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:07.220]   So the problem with the Democrats is civility.
[02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:09.420]   So my whole life, they're like, Oh no, no,
[02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:10.140]   no, don't say anything.
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:11.420]   Let's lose with civility.
[02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:11.900]   Right.
[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:15.580]   So for example, in debates, uh, you know,
[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:18.220]   whether it's on TV, online or whatever, uh,
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:20.140]   Democrats or people on the left are always
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:21.700]   saying I'm offended.
[02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:24.300]   I never get offended.
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:27.500]   No, after I'm done, you're going to be offended.
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:28.340]   Okay.
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:31.460]   Fight back, fighting back wins.
[02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:34.220]   And we couldn't get Bernie to fight back in
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:36.980]   2020, he, he was one state away.
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:38.580]   He won the first three States.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:39.860]   He crushed in Nevada.
[02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:42.300]   All we needed was South Carolina, but in
[02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:44.380]   order to get South Carolina, we all knew
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:46.460]   everybody on his campaign, everyone who's
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:48.940]   in progressive media, we all knew you've
[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:50.180]   got to attack Biden.
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:53.220]   If you don't, they're just going to tsunami
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:54.740]   you, you know, corporate medias and the
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:57.540]   corporate politicians are going to run rough
[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:58.220]   shot over you.
[02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:00.020]   You have to make the case against them.
[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:02.780]   And so two times, Bernie flinched.
[02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:05.140]   One in 2016 in the Brooklyn debate, they
[02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:07.500]   asked, did the money that Hillary Clinton
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.500]   taking from the banks affect her votes?
[02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:12.740]   And he said, no, of course it affected
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:13.340]   our votes.
[02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:14.540]   Of course it did.
[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:16.260]   You have to say yes, and you have
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.620]   to show it and prove it.
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:20.180]   The bankruptcy bill, when she was first
[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:22.460]   lady, she was totally in favor of the
[02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:24.500]   American people and against the bankruptcy
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:27.900]   bill because it has the banks, you can't
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:30.220]   discharge any debts that the credit, you
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:31.900]   know, credit card debt and bank debt, et
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:32.340]   cetera.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:33.580]   It's an awful bill.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:35.340]   It's one of the most corporatist bills.
[02:37:35.340 --> 02:37:37.420]   She was on the right side as a first lady.
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:39.620]   She becomes a Senator, takes banker money
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:41.900]   and all of a sudden she flips over to the
[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:44.620]   banker side, say it, Bernie, for God's sake,
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:45.420]   say it right.
[02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:49.020]   Then in one of the debates in 2020, his
[02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:52.100]   team prepares attacks against Biden.
[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:53.860]   They're not personal.
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:56.940]   They're not like, I, you can sense by now,
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:38:00.420]   if I'm in a political race, my objective
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:02.580]   is ripped all the guys face off, right?
[02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:03.300]   Yeah.
[02:38:03.300 --> 02:38:05.780]   Politically, rhetorically, never physically.
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:06.860]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:09.740]   And so, but I would get it to a point
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.100]   where they'd think, I don't know if I'm
[02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:12.700]   going to vote for Cenk, but I know I'm not
[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:13.540]   voting for the other guy.
[02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:14.460]   Okay.
[02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:17.060]   So you got to do that if you want to win.
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:18.180]   So they prepare this.
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:19.020]   He says, I'm going to do it.
[02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:22.020]   He goes on the podium and doesn't do it
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:24.900]   because he can't, he's too damn nice.
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:26.740]   He just can't attack the other guy.
[02:38:26.740 --> 02:38:28.940]   Now that's problem number one in strategy.
[02:38:28.940 --> 02:38:30.580]   Problem number two, something you alluded to.
[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:32.740]   So Biden gets an office.
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:34.100]   Bernie thinks they're friends.
[02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:35.900]   They're not friends.
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:37.380]   Biden's just using him.
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:40.900]   So he uses them to get the credibility and
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:44.940]   then he eviscerates 85% of the progressive
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:46.460]   proposals that Bernie put forward.
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:48.740]   Biden throws away $15 minimum wage.
[02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:50.340]   That was Bernie's signature issue.
[02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:52.860]   Doesn't even propose the public option.
[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:55.540]   Dumps paid family for no reason.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:56.940]   I can go on and on.
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:59.060]   And Bernie co-signs on it because he
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:00.740]   thinks he's in an alliance.
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:03.420]   He thinks Biden's on his side and he thinks
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:04.300]   we're going to get things done.
[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:06.700]   And to be fair to Bernie, like I said
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:08.820]   earlier, Obama got only 5% of his agenda
[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:10.900]   passed and Biden got 15%.
[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:12.300]   Okay.
[02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:15.020]   So you're right, Bernie, you got three
[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:16.900]   times more than under Obama, but you're
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:19.100]   wrong, that is not fundamental change.
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:21.180]   And without fundamental change, we're screwed.
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:24.220]   Uh, let me ask you about another
[02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:26.580]   impressive speech, AOC.
[02:39:26.580 --> 02:39:29.780]   Uh, is it possible that she's the
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:32.260]   future of the party, future president?
[02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:33.140]   No.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:37.020]   Uh, so AOC, in my opinion, lost her way.
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:38.220]   And so.
[02:39:38.220 --> 02:39:40.300]   In which way?
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:43.300]   So it's tough talking about these things
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:44.780]   because people take it so personally.
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:45.300]   Right.
[02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:48.620]   And, and that's why you'll see very few
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:51.380]   politicians on our shows because we give
[02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:54.860]   super tough interviews and the words out
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:55.980]   in the street, right?
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:58.180]   Like don't go to Young Turks, they'll,
[02:39:58.180 --> 02:39:59.780]   they'll ask you super hard questions.
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:00.260]   Right.
[02:40:00.260 --> 02:40:02.900]   So the only couple do it like Ro Khanna
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:04.860]   does it, he's brave when we'll get into
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:06.460]   shouting matches sometimes in the middle
[02:40:06.460 --> 02:40:08.460]   of bills and stuff, but at least he's there
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:09.380]   to defend his position.
[02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:10.100]   I respect him for that.
[02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:11.700]   Tim Ryan, a little bit more of a
[02:40:11.700 --> 02:40:13.100]   conservative Democrat when he was in the
[02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:15.420]   house, he would take, take on any debate,
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:15.740]   et cetera.
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:17.340]   So there's a couple of good guys that do
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:18.340]   it, but generally they don't.
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:21.980]   So what this relates to AOC, because when
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:25.380]   AOC is running, we do 34 videos on her.
[02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:28.100]   We get her millions of views.
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:32.540]   We founded Just Democrats and now launched
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:33.300]   it on the show.
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:36.180]   Our audience, Ryan Grim documents it in
[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:37.060]   one of his books.
[02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:38.900]   Our audience raises two and a half
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:41.220]   million dollars for those progressive
[02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:42.940]   candidates overall.
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:46.380]   Uh, and at that point AOC and all those
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:48.740]   Rashida Tlaib, et cetera, they're all
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:50.340]   dying to come on a Young Turks.
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:50.820]   Makes sense.
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:52.220]   I would too, of course, it's not because
[02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:54.020]   it's the Young Turks, any media outlet and
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:56.020]   most media outlets, almost all the media
[02:40:56.020 --> 02:40:56.940]   outlets reject them.
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:59.340]   We cover AOC more than all the
[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:00.660]   other press combined.
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:01.380]   Right.
[02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:03.900]   And she wins for a number of reasons.
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:05.100]   That's one of the reasons, but there's
[02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:05.660]   many others.
[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:07.660]   And she did a terrific job herself.
[02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:12.060]   Um, she then takes Shoykot and Corbyn,
[02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:14.860]   who were the, uh, Shoykot was a head of
[02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:17.420]   Just Democrats and Corbyn was communications
[02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:18.820]   director for Just Democrats.
[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:21.420]   Then Shoykot made one of the most brilliant
[02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:24.460]   political decisions in arguably in American
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:24.940]   history.
[02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:27.140]   He said, he called me and he said, Cenk,
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:29.420]   I'm going to go from head of Just Democrats
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:31.420]   to running AOC's campaign.
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:33.860]   And I'm like, well, the other candidates
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:35.820]   are going to get pissed and you're staking
[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:38.300]   the entire enterprise on one candidate.
[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:40.380]   I'm like, Shoykot, I'm not in it.
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:41.620]   I'm doing the media arm.
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:43.860]   You're, you're in the, in the trenches.
[02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:45.540]   You're the guy making the decisions.
[02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:47.860]   So I'm going to trust whatever you say.
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:49.060]   You sure?
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:50.780]   And he said, yeah, I'm sure.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:54.100]   So him and Corbyn go over to AOC's campaign.
[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:57.140]   AOC then wins that miraculous win.
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:00.260]   Then she hires Shoykot to be her chief of
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:02.420]   staff and she hires Corbyn to be her
[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:03.420]   communications director.
[02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:05.460]   Within six months, they're gone.
[02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:09.020]   And once they're gone, AOC then goes on
[02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:10.060]   an establishment path.
[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:10.780]   Okay.
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:12.700]   Because why were they gone?
[02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:15.300]   Oh, they insulted one of her colleagues.
[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:15.820]   Yeah.
[02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:17.900]   That colleague who's a total corporatist
[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:19.860]   and was selling out one of our policy
[02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:20.540]   proposals.
[02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:23.100]   If you don't call out your own side, you're
[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:24.820]   never going to get anything done.
[02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:27.060]   But if you call out your own side, you
[02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:29.860]   become persona non grata and it is super
[02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:32.940]   uncomfortable and we couldn't get them to
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:34.860]   do things that were uncomfortable.
[02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:36.940]   Now she's going to find that outrageous
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:39.420]   and she's going to be very offended by
[02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:41.500]   that and she's going to point to a bunch
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:43.820]   of things she did that were uncomfortable.
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:46.420]   And to be fair to her, she does, she has,
[02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:48.220]   she's, until that speech, she was pretty
[02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:50.420]   good on Palestine when we desperately
[02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:50.980]   needed it.
[02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:52.860]   She was pretty good on a bunch of issues.
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:55.980]   Cori Bush did that campaign on evictions,
[02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:57.220]   et cetera, on the Capitol studs.
[02:42:57.220 --> 02:42:58.020]   That was great.
[02:42:58.020 --> 02:43:00.780]   AOC's original sit-in in Pelosi's office.
[02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:03.220]   That point, we're all still on the same team.
[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:05.420]   It's a spectacular success.
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:07.620]   Me, Corbyn and Shortcut are saying,
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:08.860]   do it again, do it again.
[02:43:08.860 --> 02:43:10.180]   Like now don't abuse it.
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:11.740]   Like don't be a clown and do it every other
[02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:14.220]   day, but like when it matters, you need to
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:16.100]   be able to challenge Pelosi, right.
[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:20.820]   And in my opinion, she just got to a point
[02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:23.340]   where she got exhausted being uncomfortable.
[02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:25.500]   It's like, it's really hard.
[02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:28.300]   The media hates you and they keep pounding
[02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:30.540]   away and calling you a radical and you're
[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:32.300]   destroying the democratic party.
[02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:33.980]   You're destroying unity.
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:37.380]   So, whereas if you go along, all of a
[02:43:37.380 --> 02:43:41.300]   sudden you're a queen and now all of a
[02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:42.620]   sudden the mainstream media is saying,
[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:44.980]   oh, AOC, she could be the progress.
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:46.780]   I mean, there's some degree to which you
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:49.420]   want to sometimes bide your time and just
[02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:51.220]   like rest a bit.
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:53.900]   And I think from my perspective, maybe
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:54.700]   you can educate me.
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:58.020]   She seems like a legit, progressive,
[02:43:58.020 --> 02:44:03.180]   legit, even populist, charismatic, young,
[02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:07.060]   like a lot of time to develop the game of
[02:44:07.060 --> 02:44:09.460]   politics, how to, how to play it well enough
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:10.940]   to avoid the bullshit.
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:13.340]   I guess she doesn't take corporate PAC money.
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:13.780]   That's right.
[02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:14.980]   No, she's still true on that.
[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:18.940]   So as far as I, just looking in the, over
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:20.660]   the next few elections, like who's going
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:22.820]   to be running, who's going to be, who's
[02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:25.340]   going to be a real player, she just seems
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:27.340]   like an, like to me, it seems like an obvious
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:29.140]   person that's going to be in the race.
[02:44:29.140 --> 02:44:35.620]   So while I fight for the ideal, I'm very
[02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:36.140]   practical.
[02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:44.580]   So for example, she wins, and then one cycle
[02:44:44.580 --> 02:44:49.900]   later, after 2020, there's these guys who
[02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:51.500]   want to quote, unquote, force the vote.
[02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:54.900]   And it was a, on the speakership of Nancy
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:58.100]   Pelosi, and they wanted to use it to get
[02:44:58.100 --> 02:44:58.820]   Medicare for all.
[02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:01.180]   I'm like, guys, forcing a vote is a terrific
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:05.260]   idea on the speakership.
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:06.220]   Okay.
[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:07.460]   Who's your alternative?
[02:45:07.460 --> 02:45:09.140]   Oh, we don't have an alternative already.
[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:09.980]   Giant red flag.
[02:45:09.980 --> 02:45:10.660]   Okay.
[02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:14.260]   Um, what's the issue you're looking to have
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.580]   them vote on Medicare for all?
[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:17.220]   Oh, you don't know politics.
[02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:20.340]   So I love Medicare for all, we have to get
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:23.940]   Medicare for all, but if you, if that's the
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:25.900]   first one you put up without gaining any
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:27.860]   leverage, you're going to get slaughtered.
[02:45:27.860 --> 02:45:31.940]   Put up something easy, force a vote on $15
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:33.700]   minimum wage, or pick another one that's
[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:34.780]   easy, paid family leave.
[02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:37.180]   These are all polling great because if you
[02:45:37.180 --> 02:45:39.340]   force a vote on that, you could actually win.
[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:41.980]   And if you win, you gain leverage.
[02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:43.620]   And then you do the next one and the next
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:46.020]   one, and then you do Medicare for all, not
[02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:48.340]   bullshit gradualism that the corporate
[02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:51.060]   Democrats do, but actually strategically
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:53.340]   practically building up power and leverage
[02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:55.060]   and using it at the right times.
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:57.660]   So if I thought that's what AOC was doing,
[02:45:57.660 --> 02:45:58.620]   I would love it.
[02:45:58.620 --> 02:45:59.340]   Right?
[02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:01.220]   So I don't need her to force a vote on
[02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:02.100]   Medicare for all.
[02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:04.140]   I don't need her to go on some wild
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:07.060]   tangents that don't make any sense and is
[02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:08.380]   only going to diminish your power.
[02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:12.820]   But when they eviscerated all the progressive
[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:16.300]   proposals and build back better, how did that
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:19.780]   happen, Manchin and Sinema used every ounce
[02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:20.780]   of leverage they had.
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:22.940]   They said, I'm just not going to vote for it.
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:23.660]   I don't care.
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:24.300]   Okay.
[02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:26.620]   Uh, you know, the status quo is perfect
[02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:28.020]   for my donors, so I don't need you.
[02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:29.300]   I vote no.
[02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:29.940]   Okay.
[02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:31.540]   Now take out everything I want.
[02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:33.900]   And Biden did, right?
[02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:37.660]   Progressives had to push back and say,
[02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:43.020]   here is two to three proposals, right?
[02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:45.060]   Not everything, not everything, two to
[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:48.420]   three proposals, they all pull over 70%.
[02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:50.420]   They're all no brainers.
[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:52.620]   And they're all things that Joe Biden promised.
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:54.700]   We want those in the bill.
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:55.820]   Otherwise we're voting no.
[02:46:55.820 --> 02:46:58.180]   At that point, the media, what would have
[02:46:58.180 --> 02:47:00.380]   happened is the media would have exploded
[02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:02.260]   and they would have said AOC and the rest
[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:03.900]   are the scum of the earth.
[02:47:03.900 --> 02:47:05.860]   They're ruining the democratic party.
[02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:07.420]   We're not going to get the bill.
[02:47:07.420 --> 02:47:08.540]   They're the worst.
[02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:10.780]   You have to withstand that.
[02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:13.140]   If you cannot withstand a nuclear blast
[02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:15.620]   for mainstream media, you're not the person
[02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:18.060]   because you, that's, you have to run that
[02:47:18.060 --> 02:47:20.060]   obstacle course to get to change.
[02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:22.500]   If they had stood their ground, they
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:24.700]   definitely would have won on one to two of
[02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:25.460]   those issues.
[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:28.140]   Instead, they went with a strategy that
[02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:31.140]   was called, it was literally called trust Biden.
[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:32.420]   All right.
[02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:34.340]   So, uh, big question.
[02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:36.740]   Who wins, uh, who wins this election?
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:38.620]   Kamala or Trump?
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:41.300]   And what's Kamala's path to victory?
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:43.700]   And, uh, if you can steal man, what's
[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:44.820]   Trump's path to victory?
[02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:45.340]   Yeah.
[02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:47.860]   So there's not enough information yet.
[02:47:47.860 --> 02:47:52.100]   So since I make a lot of predictions on air
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:55.140]   and then brag about it unbearably, um,
[02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:59.460]   people are always, they'll stop me in the
[02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:00.740]   streets and they'll be like, predict this,
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:02.500]   like predict my marriage, brother.
[02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:03.780]   I don't know anything about your marriage.
[02:48:03.780 --> 02:48:05.500]   How could I possibly predict something
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:06.980]   without having any information?
[02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:09.940]   So in the case of the, uh, this campaign,
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:13.100]   uh, right now I got Kamala Harris at 55%
[02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:13.700]   chance of winning.
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:14.220]   Okay.
[02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:15.060]   Which is not bad.
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:16.940]   Doesn't mean she's going to win by 55,
[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:18.260]   because then that wouldn't be a 10 point
[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:18.500]   margin.
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:19.220]   That's not going to happen.
[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:19.540]   Right.
[02:48:19.540 --> 02:48:24.140]   But I say around 51 to 55, but it's nowhere
[02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:26.660]   near over because of a lot of things.
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:28.780]   One, uh, the Democrats are still seen as
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:31.700]   more establishment and, and people hate
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:32.380]   the establishment.
[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:36.580]   Uh, two, if war breaks out in the Middle
[02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:39.980]   East, which is now unfortunately bordering
[02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:41.220]   on likely, right.
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:44.460]   Uh, if that war breaks out, all bets are off.
[02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:45.940]   Do you mean a regional war?
[02:48:45.940 --> 02:48:46.740]   Yeah.
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:50.940]   Like Iran, Israel gets to be a real thing,
[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:53.780]   not just a pinprick and a little bombing
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:55.940]   here and an assassination there, but no,
[02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:57.180]   we're going to war, right?
[02:48:57.180 --> 02:48:59.740]   If that happens, then all bets are off and
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:01.220]   no one has any idea who's going to win.
[02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:01.820]   Okay.
[02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:03.180]   And if they're pretending that they know
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:06.020]   that's ridiculous, cause it's so unpredictable.
[02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:12.500]   Uh, and then the third bogey for her is if
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.420]   she goes back to where it sounds so that, so
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:19.460]   there's three phases of Kamala Harris's career.
[02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:21.820]   She's not necessarily any different
[02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:22.780]   in terms of policy.
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:25.300]   She's, you can frame it in a bad way.
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:26.380]   You could frame it in a good way.
[02:49:26.380 --> 02:49:29.540]   You can say, oh, she's just changed seeing
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:30.820]   which way the wind is blowing.
[02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:33.540]   And then, oh, she's a tough cop prosecutor.
[02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:33.780]   Oh.
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:35.340]   And then she's doing justice reform when
[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:37.380]   you need, people want justice reform.
[02:49:37.380 --> 02:49:39.020]   Oh, she's a waffler.
[02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:39.340]   Right.
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:42.060]   Or you could paint it as she's pretty balanced.
[02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:42.540]   Right.
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:46.180]   She prosecuted serious criminals very harshly,
[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:48.740]   but then on marijuana possession, got them
[02:49:48.740 --> 02:49:51.700]   into rehab and you know what, that's actually
[02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:52.420]   what you should do.
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:52.860]   Right.
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:55.420]   So I'm not talking about policy.
[02:49:55.420 --> 02:49:57.100]   So there you could have one of those
[02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:58.420]   views about Kamala Harris.
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:49:58.940]   And I get it.
[02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:01.860]   I'm talking about strategic stylistically.
[02:50:02.220 --> 02:50:07.540]   So Kamala Harris until the second debate in
[02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:11.180]   the primaries in 2020 is a very competent
[02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:14.500]   politician who's in line to be the next Obama.
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:15.460]   Right.
[02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:16.540]   She's killing it.
[02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:20.220]   District attorney, attorney general, Senator.
[02:50:20.220 --> 02:50:22.820]   Um, and then the first debate, if you
[02:50:22.820 --> 02:50:25.260]   remember, she won, she had that great line
[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:28.420]   about the, you know, uh, there was a little
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:30.900]   girl on that bus that was integrating the
[02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:34.260]   schools and that girl was me and Biden being
[02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:35.820]   the knucklehead that he is he's caught on
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:40.420]   tape going, don't have that reaction brother.
[02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:41.460]   Okay.
[02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:43.180]   Cause she's criticizing his segregation
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:44.900]   policy on buses back in the seventies.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:45.140]   Right.
[02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:48.460]   So anyways, so she's doing terrific.
[02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:52.820]   And then after that debate, until Biden
[02:50:52.820 --> 02:50:56.980]   drops out, is it disaster area for Kamala
[02:50:56.980 --> 02:50:59.700]   Harris's career in the primary, she starts
[02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:02.540]   falling apart, she can't strategize.
[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:02.900]   Right.
[02:51:02.900 --> 02:51:04.060]   She's for Medicare for all.
[02:51:04.060 --> 02:51:04.540]   No, she's not.
[02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:06.260]   She's for Medicare for some what's
[02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:07.580]   Medicare for some, I don't know.
[02:51:07.580 --> 02:51:08.260]   Right.
[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:10.140]   And she goes into the next debate and
[02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:12.020]   Tulsi Gabbard kicks her ass and then goes
[02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:13.780]   into the third debate, gets her ass kicked
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:15.780]   again, and she's starting to drift away.
[02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:18.700]   Then at this point, this is funny.
[02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:21.140]   Um, I have more votes for president
[02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:23.900]   than Kamala Harris does because Kamala
[02:51:23.900 --> 02:51:26.180]   Harris dropped out before Iowa, because
[02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:28.060]   that's how much of a disaster her campaign
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:30.500]   turned into when she was leading.
[02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:31.700]   She was leading.
[02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:32.140]   Right.
[02:51:32.140 --> 02:51:34.860]   So then she becomes vice president and
[02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:37.500]   Biden, probably because of that bus line,
[02:51:37.500 --> 02:51:40.020]   Jill Biden caught tremendous feelings
[02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:40.660]   over that line.
[02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:41.260]   Okay.
[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:43.980]   So Biden's like, here, have this
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:45.340]   albatross around your neck.
[02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:46.580]   It's called immigration.
[02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:47.180]   Good luck.
[02:51:47.180 --> 02:51:48.860]   I'm not going to do anything about it.
[02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:50.580]   I'm not going to change policy, but I'm
[02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:51.780]   putting you in charge of it to get
[02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:52.660]   your ass handed to you.
[02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:53.260]   Okay.
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:54.140]   And she does.
[02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:55.500]   So that's a disaster.
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:57.300]   And then she starts doing interviews
[02:51:57.340 --> 02:52:00.860]   where she's like, we have to become the
[02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:02.980]   chain, the being, but not the thing we
[02:52:02.980 --> 02:52:04.620]   were and the unbecoming.
[02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:06.380]   And you're like, what is going on?
[02:52:06.380 --> 02:52:08.540]   Why can neither one of them speak?
[02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:14.700]   And so, but then the third act shocks me.
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:17.740]   So Biden steps down, she goes, grabs
[02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:19.460]   all those delegates in a super competent
[02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:20.740]   way that we talked about earlier.
[02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:22.820]   And then she goes out and gives a speech.
[02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:24.140]   I'm like, oh, that speech is good.
[02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:25.180]   Okay.
[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:26.300]   If you had another one, another one.
[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:27.380]   I'm like, wait a minute.
[02:52:27.380 --> 02:52:28.420]   These are good speeches.
[02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:29.580]   No more word salads.
[02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:32.860]   Then she picks Tim Walz and shocks the world.
[02:52:32.860 --> 02:52:35.340]   I'm like, that's a correct VP pick.
[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:37.100]   That is a miracle.
[02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:37.540]   Right?
[02:52:37.540 --> 02:52:39.820]   And then she goes and does the economically
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:43.300]   populist plan, all those proposals about
[02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:44.980]   housing that people care about, grocery
[02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:47.460]   prices that people care about, real or not
[02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:50.100]   real, that is correct political strategy.
[02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:53.140]   So this Kamala Harris is back to their
[02:52:53.140 --> 02:52:56.180]   original Kamala Harris, who was a very
[02:52:56.180 --> 02:52:58.100]   competent, skilled politician.
[02:52:58.100 --> 02:53:00.940]   And as I was telling you offline, she's
[02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:04.980]   doing, whoever's doing her TikTok is, is
[02:53:04.980 --> 02:53:07.460]   like blowing up and they're doing risky,
[02:53:07.460 --> 02:53:08.700]   edgy stuff.
[02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:09.460]   Yes.
[02:53:09.460 --> 02:53:11.700]   I did not expect that from somebody that
[02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:14.340]   kind of comes from the Biden camp of just
[02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.780]   like, be safe, be boring, all this kind of stuff.
[02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:18.540]   So you have to give Kamala Harris ultimate
[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:20.100]   credit because she's the leader of the
[02:53:20.100 --> 02:53:22.300]   campaign and she makes the final decisions.
[02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:25.220]   But there's, there's apparently a couple
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:26.980]   of people inside that campaign that are
[02:53:26.980 --> 02:53:29.340]   ass kickers and they're, and they have
[02:53:29.340 --> 02:53:31.780]   convinced her to take risk, which Democrats
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:34.780]   never take, and it is correct to take risk.
[02:53:34.780 --> 02:53:36.900]   You cannot get to victory without risk.
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:41.140]   So, um, the vice president pick was, is
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:41.780]   the bellwether.
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:44.780]   When Hillary Clinton picked Tim Kaine, I
[02:53:44.780 --> 02:53:46.940]   said, that's it, she's going to lose because
[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:48.940]   Tim Kaine is playing prevent defense.
[02:53:48.940 --> 02:53:51.340]   He's, he's, he's wallpaper.
[02:53:51.340 --> 02:53:52.660]   I mean, he'd be lucky to be wallpaper.
[02:53:52.660 --> 02:53:53.820]   He's just a white wall, right?
[02:53:53.820 --> 02:53:56.380]   He's just, and when he speaks as white noise,
[02:53:56.380 --> 02:53:57.900]   he never says anything interesting.
[02:53:57.900 --> 02:53:59.500]   He's the most boring pick of all time.
[02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:00.980]   That's saying we already won.
[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:01.460]   Ha ha.
[02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:02.140]   Okay.
[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:04.820]   If Kamala Harris had picked Mark Kelly,
[02:54:04.820 --> 02:54:06.620]   that's the Tim Kaine equivalent.
[02:54:06.620 --> 02:54:07.580]   Okay.
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:08.700]   Oh, he's an astronaut.
[02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:10.060]   I don't give a shit that he's an astronaut.
[02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:11.100]   What is he saying?
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:12.500]   Is he a good politician?
[02:54:12.500 --> 02:54:13.980]   Does he have good policies?
[02:54:13.980 --> 02:54:16.220]   Is he exciting on the campaign trail?
[02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:18.660]   Is he going to add to your momentum?
[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:21.820]   Mark Kelly, he might be a good guy, but number
[02:54:21.820 --> 02:54:23.420]   one, he's a very corporate Democrat.
[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:28.060]   And number two, it's like watching grass grow.
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:29.820]   Oh, he's terrible at speaking.
[02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:30.740]   If you ask me, right.
[02:54:30.740 --> 02:54:32.580]   So, so I thought for sure, she's going to
[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:35.380]   pick Mark Kelly because that's what a normal
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:37.420]   Democrat does, or if they want to go wild
[02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:38.980]   and crazy, they'll go to Bashir.
[02:54:38.980 --> 02:54:41.900]   So I was like, please let it be Shapiro
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:44.140]   because he's at least not bad.
[02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:45.820]   He's done some populous things and he's
[02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:47.140]   strategic, he's really smart.
[02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:48.860]   I need smart candidates.
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:50.300]   Dumb candidates don't help.
[02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:51.420]   They don't have a mind of their own.
[02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:52.460]   They can't take risks.
[02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:54.060]   They're not independent thinkers.
[02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:55.180]   They're, they're going to lose.
[02:54:55.180 --> 02:54:57.460]   So she picks the smartest, most populous
[02:54:57.460 --> 02:54:58.340]   candidate, boom, boom.
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:54:58.940]   We got a winner.
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:00.180]   That's a good campaign.
[02:55:00.180 --> 02:55:04.260]   Uh, speaking of risks, when they debate,
[02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:07.780]   when Kamala and Trump debate, what do you
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:09.020]   think that's going to look like?
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:10.900]   Who do you think is going to win?
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:13.260]   Oh, that's not close.
[02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:14.100]   Kamala Harris will win.
[02:55:14.100 --> 02:55:14.780]   Yeah.
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:16.900]   Unless she falls apart, unless she goes
[02:55:16.900 --> 02:55:18.700]   back to the bad era, right.
[02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:19.860]   That's risk number three.
[02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:21.860]   Well, hold on a second for, oh, I guess
[02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:23.900]   in a debate, you don't have, you can have
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:26.300]   pre-written, it seems like when she's
[02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:27.860]   going off the top of her head is when the
[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:29.780]   word, word salad sometimes comes out.
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:30.620]   Sometimes.
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:31.940]   Yeah, we'll have to see, right.
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:33.020]   We'll have to see, because she hasn't
[02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:34.220]   done any tough interviews.
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:36.100]   She hasn't really been challenged.
[02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:38.900]   So I hope to God that doesn't happen.
[02:55:38.900 --> 02:55:40.460]   That she doesn't fall apart, you mean?
[02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:40.740]   Yeah.
[02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:42.700]   Cause I hope she does a bunch of interviews, right?
[02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:43.340]   Oh, definitely.
[02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:43.780]   Definitely.
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:48.060]   I'm like, I'm, this is going to sound
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:49.180]   really funny, I'm too honest.
[02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:52.060]   But, but I am like in, in the context
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:53.620]   of Kamala Harris probably shouldn't
[02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:54.500]   come on The Young Turks.
[02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:56.260]   We do a really tough interview
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:55:56.860]   and it would hurt her.
[02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:57.580]   Okay.
[02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:58.500]   Do you though?
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:56:00.780]   Like it's tough, but like, you're pretty
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:01.500]   respectful.
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:05.540]   Maybe I just have my sort of, uh, uh, like
[02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:07.660]   I'm okay with a little bit of tension.
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:08.780]   You're pretty respectful.
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:09.980]   Even when you're yelling, there's like
[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:14.940]   respect, like you, you don't do, uh, uh,
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:16.660]   like a gotcha type thing.
[02:56:16.660 --> 02:56:18.540]   There's certain things you could do.
[02:56:18.540 --> 02:56:21.740]   Like you said this in the past, you can
[02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:23.860]   say a line from the past that's out of
[02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:27.860]   context, uh, it forces the other person
[02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:29.060]   to have to define the content.
[02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:30.900]   You just get, you know, sort of debate
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:33.700]   type tactics, uh, over and over it.
[02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:34.940]   Like, you don't seem to do that.
[02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:36.740]   You just like ask them questions
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:38.740]   genuinely, and then you argue the point.
[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:41.100]   And then you also like hear what they say.
[02:56:41.100 --> 02:56:43.060]   The only thing I've seen you do sometimes
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:44.700]   tough that you sometimes like interrupt,
[02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:46.940]   like you speak over the person if they
[02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:48.140]   are trying to do the same.
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:49.860]   Right, only if they're filibustering.
[02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:51.460]   Yeah, if they're filibustering.
[02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:53.060]   But like that, that's a tricky one.
[02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:54.460]   That's um, yeah, that's a tricky one.
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:54.700]   Right.
[02:56:54.700 --> 02:56:58.180]   No, but Lex, the problem for her coming
[02:56:58.180 --> 02:57:00.340]   on our show, isn't that we would be unfair
[02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:01.980]   to her, it's that we would be fair.
[02:57:01.980 --> 02:57:05.260]   So we would ask questions she is going
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:06.220]   to have trouble answering.
[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:07.620]   Other corporate, corporate stuff.
[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:08.300]   Right.
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:10.900]   I mean, like, so Biden said he was
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:12.380]   going to take the corporate tax rate to
[02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:15.180]   28% and he barely tried.
[02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:17.380]   You say you're going to take it to 28%.
[02:57:17.380 --> 02:57:18.340]   Why should we trust you?
[02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:19.340]   Right.
[02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:21.900]   You guys said $15 minimum wage, and
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:23.300]   then you took it out of the bill.
[02:57:23.300 --> 02:57:24.300]   Why should we trust you?
[02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:25.020]   Right.
[02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:26.580]   Those are very tough questions.
[02:57:26.580 --> 02:57:28.380]   She's never going to get that in mainstream media.
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:30.580]   Mainstream media is going to have foe
[02:57:30.580 --> 02:57:32.620]   toughness, but in reality, they're going
[02:57:32.620 --> 02:57:34.020]   to be softballs, right.
[02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:37.660]   And so the debates, you're right, Lex, is,
[02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:39.860]   is a little bit easier because Sarah Palin
[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:42.780]   proved that you could just memorize
[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:44.780]   scripted talking points.
[02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:46.940]   And she admitted it later.
[02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:49.220]   She's like, she was super nervous.
[02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:51.140]   She memorized the talking points and
[02:57:51.140 --> 02:57:52.980]   no matter what they asked, she just
[02:57:52.980 --> 02:57:54.860]   gave the talking point, which by the
[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:57.180]   way, people barely noticed because
[02:57:57.180 --> 02:57:58.300]   that's what all politicians do.
[02:57:58.300 --> 02:58:00.620]   She just admitted it.
[02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:05.220]   And so no, Trump's a disaster in a debate.
[02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:07.580]   He's a, he's a one man wrecking
[02:58:07.580 --> 02:58:09.100]   crew of his own campaign.
[02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:12.300]   So any competent debater would
[02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:13.420]   eviscerate Donald Trump.
[02:58:13.420 --> 02:58:16.220]   I mean, they just, on any given topic,
[02:58:16.220 --> 02:58:19.220]   when he says something like here, let's
[02:58:19.220 --> 02:58:22.340]   take one lunatic conspiracy theory that
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:25.020]   he just had recently, uh, and by the way,
[02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:26.220]   if you're a right-winger and you keep
[02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:28.060]   getting hurt every time I say he's a
[02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:31.340]   lunatic or I insult Donald Trump, don't
[02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:33.500]   like, you're, you sound like a left-winger.
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:34.140]   I'm offended.
[02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:34.660]   I'm offended.
[02:58:34.660 --> 02:58:35.220]   I'm offended.
[02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:35.900]   Get over it.
[02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:36.700]   Get over it.
[02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:37.300]   Okay.
[02:58:37.300 --> 02:58:39.940]   So we, we have disagreements here.
[02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:41.580]   What the other side is saying, and by
[02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:43.060]   the way, I say the same thing to the left.
[02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:43.660]   Okay.
[02:58:43.660 --> 02:58:45.700]   I say you, you think everybody on the
[02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:47.620]   right's evil, you're crazy.
[02:58:47.620 --> 02:58:49.380]   No, they just have a different way of
[02:58:49.380 --> 02:58:50.900]   looking at the world, which by the way,
[02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:51.900]   is an interesting conversation.
[02:58:51.900 --> 02:58:53.660]   We should talk about that in a minute too.
[02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:57.060]   But so I, I do it to both sides, but okay.
[02:58:57.060 --> 02:59:00.740]   But Trump says, oh, I, I don't think
[02:59:00.740 --> 02:59:03.220]   there's anyone at Kamala Harris's rallies.
[02:59:03.220 --> 02:59:05.380]   It's, uh, all the pictures are AI.
[02:59:05.380 --> 02:59:06.780]   Okay.
[02:59:06.780 --> 02:59:08.300]   So let's say he says that in a debate
[02:59:08.300 --> 02:59:10.260]   because he's liable to say anything, right?
[02:59:10.260 --> 02:59:12.860]   You just say, okay, so you think every
[02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:16.180]   reporter that was there, every photographer
[02:59:16.180 --> 02:59:18.300]   that was there, every human being that was
[02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:20.580]   there, they're all lying.
[02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:22.700]   They have a conspiracy of thousands of
[02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:25.340]   people, but none of them were actually there.
[02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:29.420]   Do you understand how insane you sound?
[02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:32.500]   So this is a good place to, uh, can you
[02:59:32.500 --> 02:59:33.860]   steel man the case for Trump?
[02:59:33.860 --> 02:59:34.900]   Yeah.
[02:59:34.900 --> 02:59:35.540]   Yeah.
[02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:39.180]   So Trump is a massive risk because of all
[02:59:39.180 --> 02:59:41.220]   the things we talked about earlier, but
[02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:44.020]   there is a percentage chance that he's such
[02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:46.740]   a wild card that he overturns the whole system.
[02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:48.780]   And that is why the establishment
[02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:49.980]   is a little scared of him.
[02:59:49.980 --> 02:59:53.300]   So if he's in office here, I'll give you a
[02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:55.100]   case of Donald Trump doing something right.
[02:59:55.100 --> 02:59:57.500]   Something wrong first and then something right.
[02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:00.820]   So he bombs, uh, Soleimani, the top
[03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:02.100]   general of Iran and kills him.
[03:00:02.100 --> 03:00:05.220]   That risks World War III, that risks a giant
[03:00:05.220 --> 03:00:06.980]   war with Iran that devolves Iran.
[03:00:06.980 --> 03:00:08.580]   It's four times the size of Iraq.
[03:00:08.580 --> 03:00:10.220]   If you're anti-war, you should have
[03:00:10.220 --> 03:00:12.620]   hated that he assassinated Soleimani.
[03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:16.700]   But after the assassination, Iran doesn't
[03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:18.260]   want to get into it, even though they're in
[03:00:18.260 --> 03:00:20.340]   a rage and they do a small bombing.
[03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:21.980]   You can tell if it's a small or a big one.
[03:00:21.980 --> 03:00:22.340]   Right.
[03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:24.580]   So that's them saying, we don't really want
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:26.580]   war, but for our domestic crowd, we have
[03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:27.380]   to bomb you back.
[03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:27.780]   Right.
[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:30.620]   And that's when the military industrial
[03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:33.980]   complex comes to Trump and says, no, you
[03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:36.500]   have to show them who's tough and bomb this
[03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:39.940]   area and Trump says, no, they did a
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:41.380]   small bombing, not a large bombing.
[03:00:41.380 --> 03:00:42.300]   I don't want the war.
[03:00:42.300 --> 03:00:43.900]   I'm not going to do that bombing.
[03:00:43.900 --> 03:00:45.820]   That was this shining moment.
[03:00:45.820 --> 03:00:46.180]   Yeah.
[03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:47.980]   For, for me, one of the biggest steel
[03:00:47.980 --> 03:00:50.940]   man for Trump is that he has both the
[03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:53.380]   skill and the predisposition to not be a
[03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:58.260]   warmonger, he, I think better than the
[03:00:58.260 --> 03:01:00.020]   other candidates I've seen is able to end
[03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:03.220]   wars and, and them that you might disagree
[03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:05.940]   with it, but in a way where there's
[03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:08.460]   legitimately effective negotiation that
[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:12.460]   happens, like, I just don't see any other
[03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:14.380]   candidate currently being able to sit
[03:01:14.380 --> 03:01:16.820]   down with Zelensky and Putin and to
[03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:20.260]   negotiate a peace treaty that both are
[03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:21.900]   equally unhappy with.
[03:01:21.900 --> 03:01:28.540]   So on the one hand, almost all other
[03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:30.220]   politicians are going to be controlled by
[03:01:30.220 --> 03:01:31.780]   the military industrial complex.
[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:36.140]   And that complex wants to bleed Russia dry.
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:38.420]   And that's what the Ukraine war is doing.
[03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:41.420]   It's a double win for the defense
[03:01:41.420 --> 03:01:43.540]   contractors, number one, every dollar we
[03:01:43.540 --> 03:01:45.940]   spend to you, uh, send to Ukraine is
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:47.300]   actually not going to Ukraine.
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:49.740]   It's going to U S defense contractors,
[03:01:49.740 --> 03:01:52.060]   and then they are sending old weapons to
[03:01:52.060 --> 03:01:54.780]   Ukraine, the money is to build new weapons
[03:01:54.780 --> 03:01:55.460]   for us.
[03:01:55.460 --> 03:01:57.220]   So a lot of people don't know that.
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:01:59.460]   So the defense contractors want that
[03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:00.700]   war to go on forever.
[03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:02.860]   And they're an enormous
[03:02:02.860 --> 03:02:03.980]   influence in Washington.
[03:02:03.980 --> 03:02:06.260]   The second win is they're depleting
[03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:09.580]   Russia and Russia's gotten themselves
[03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:11.540]   into a quagmire like we did in Iraq and
[03:02:11.540 --> 03:02:14.340]   Afghanistan and they're bleeding out.
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:17.820]   So they, the military industrial complex
[03:02:17.820 --> 03:02:19.780]   wants Russia to bleed out for as long
[03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:20.820]   as humanly possible.
[03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:23.100]   They actually care more about their own
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:24.500]   interests, of course, than they do
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.220]   about Ukrainian interests.
[03:02:26.220 --> 03:02:28.700]   So in fact, there's a good argument to
[03:02:28.700 --> 03:02:30.180]   be made that Ukraine could have gotten a
[03:02:30.180 --> 03:02:31.340]   peace deal earlier.
[03:02:31.340 --> 03:02:33.300]   Uh, and we prevented it.
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:38.140]   So, but the bottom line now is probably
[03:02:38.140 --> 03:02:40.220]   how a deal gets done is they let go of
[03:02:40.220 --> 03:02:43.180]   three more areas in Ukraine.
[03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:44.580]   They already lost Crimea.
[03:02:44.580 --> 03:02:46.540]   They'd have to let go of three more
[03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:50.380]   regions and that is tough because at that
[03:02:50.380 --> 03:02:52.500]   point, Russia's a little bit encouraged.
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:54.420]   Every time they do an invasion,
[03:02:54.420 --> 03:02:55.500]   they get more land.
[03:02:55.500 --> 03:02:57.100]   They might not get all the land they
[03:02:57.100 --> 03:02:58.660]   wanted, but they get a lot of land.
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:02.260]   So that's, it's a very difficult issue,
[03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:06.060]   but literally which, which person, if
[03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:08.180]   they become president will end the war.
[03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:10.820]   Trump will end that war because
[03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:12.620]   Trump will go in and he loves
[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:13.820]   Russia and Putin anyway.
[03:03:13.820 --> 03:03:15.140]   I just disagree with it.
[03:03:15.140 --> 03:03:16.340]   He loves Russia.
[03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:19.980]   The implication of that meaning he will
[03:03:19.980 --> 03:03:21.260]   do whatever Putin tells him.
[03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:22.820]   I think.
[03:03:22.820 --> 03:03:24.700]   He'll do 90% of what Putin tells him.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:27.100]   Uh, I just disagree with that.
[03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:31.500]   I think, uh, I think he wants to be the
[03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:33.340]   kind of person that says, fuck you to
[03:03:33.340 --> 03:03:36.420]   Putin while, while patting them on the
[03:03:36.420 --> 03:03:39.380]   back and being, you know, but out negotiating
[03:03:39.380 --> 03:03:39.740]   Putin.
[03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:41.900]   So I don't like talking about Russia
[03:03:41.900 --> 03:03:43.420]   because there's so much emotions that
[03:03:43.420 --> 03:03:44.540]   go into that topic.
[03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:46.620]   The right wing, the minute you mention
[03:03:46.620 --> 03:03:49.620]   Russia, they're like, oh, it's a hoax
[03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:52.180]   and all this baggage that comes with it,
[03:03:52.180 --> 03:03:52.740]   et cetera.
[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:54.900]   To me, Russia is not any different than
[03:03:54.900 --> 03:03:57.780]   Saudi Arabia or Israel for Trump.
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:03:59.380]   You give me money.
[03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:00.140]   I like you.
[03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:01.860]   You get by my apartments.
[03:04:01.860 --> 03:04:02.580]   I like you.
[03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:03.220]   Right.
[03:04:03.220 --> 03:04:05.660]   If you don't give me money, I don't like
[03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:07.540]   you, it's not that complicated.
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:08.700]   So, okay.
[03:04:08.700 --> 03:04:11.540]   Like, don't worry about the Russia part
[03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:11.780]   of it.
[03:04:11.780 --> 03:04:15.580]   Like the bottom line is Trump thinks,
[03:04:15.580 --> 03:04:17.140]   what do I care about those three
[03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:18.060]   regions of Ukraine?
[03:04:18.060 --> 03:04:19.300]   I want to get this thing done.
[03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:19.820]   Right.
[03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:22.820]   So he'll go and he'll say, Ukraine,
[03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:24.740]   we're going to withdraw all help unless
[03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:26.380]   you agree to a peace deal with Russia
[03:04:26.380 --> 03:04:27.820]   and Russia wants those three regions.
[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:29.100]   That's the peace deal.
[03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:30.220]   That's it.
[03:04:30.700 --> 03:04:32.900]   So Ukraine will lose a part of their
[03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:35.380]   country and we'll get to a peace deal.
[03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:36.260]   Yeah.
[03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:37.380]   I hope not.
[03:04:37.380 --> 03:04:38.100]   I hope not.
[03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:43.860]   I think Trump sees themselves and wants
[03:04:43.860 --> 03:04:45.260]   to be a great negotiator.
[03:04:45.260 --> 03:04:50.500]   So, and I personally want the death, the
[03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:51.620]   death of people to end.
[03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:53.980]   And I think Trump would bring that much
[03:04:53.980 --> 03:04:57.820]   faster and I disagree with you, at least
[03:04:57.980 --> 03:05:00.780]   my hope is that he would negotiate
[03:05:00.780 --> 03:05:02.660]   something that would be fair.
[03:05:02.660 --> 03:05:07.060]   He's not, his anti-war record is so
[03:05:07.060 --> 03:05:11.100]   complicated because moving the embassy
[03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:14.020]   in Israel and killing the top Iranian
[03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:16.580]   general were super provocative and they
[03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:18.980]   could have easily triggered a giant war
[03:05:18.980 --> 03:05:20.700]   there and then you know what's going to
[03:05:20.700 --> 03:05:22.500]   happen if you get into any kind of real
[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.020]   war, Trump's going to want to prove his
[03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:24.940]   buttons larger.
[03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:27.100]   So then he's going to do massive
[03:05:27.100 --> 03:05:29.420]   ridiculous bombings.
[03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:30.860]   I mean, I worry about nukes.
[03:05:30.860 --> 03:05:34.060]   And so we had Giuliani on the show, on the
[03:05:34.060 --> 03:05:36.180]   RNC and I asked him this question, I said,
[03:05:36.180 --> 03:05:38.340]   you know, I keep saying, oh, they wouldn't
[03:05:38.340 --> 03:05:39.780]   do it if I was in charge.
[03:05:39.780 --> 03:05:41.740]   I'm like, what does that mean?
[03:05:41.740 --> 03:05:43.780]   Cause it sounds like what it means is they
[03:05:43.780 --> 03:05:46.140]   wouldn't do it because they know if they did
[03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:49.700]   it, I would do something insane, like attack
[03:05:49.700 --> 03:05:52.820]   Russia or use nukes.
[03:05:52.820 --> 03:05:55.220]   And Rudy said, yeah, that's what it means.
[03:05:55.700 --> 03:05:58.740]   So that means you have to at least bluff
[03:05:58.740 --> 03:06:00.220]   that and you have to get them to believe
[03:06:00.220 --> 03:06:01.340]   that he's a madman.
[03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:03.300]   That's the madman theory of Nixon and
[03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:05.260]   Nixon, and Rudy said that too.
[03:06:05.260 --> 03:06:06.740]   He was very clear about it.
[03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:09.140]   But the problem is if you get your bluff
[03:06:09.140 --> 03:06:12.500]   called and so if you actually attack Russia,
[03:06:12.500 --> 03:06:15.020]   you're going to start World War III.
[03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:20.460]   So that's why, yeah, if you could, if you
[03:06:20.460 --> 03:06:22.980]   could just get away with bluffing, maybe,
[03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:26.900]   but he's playing a very dangerous game and
[03:06:26.900 --> 03:06:28.660]   he massively increased drone strikes.
[03:06:28.660 --> 03:06:31.660]   On the other hand, he didn't bomb Iran
[03:06:31.660 --> 03:06:33.340]   further, and on the other hand, he started
[03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:35.660]   the process of withdrawal from Afghanistan.
[03:06:35.660 --> 03:06:40.060]   So not black and white, complicated record.
[03:06:40.060 --> 03:06:41.580]   And one thing, I'll give him another
[03:06:41.580 --> 03:06:42.380]   piece of credit here.
[03:06:42.380 --> 03:06:45.540]   I think I'm taking this steel manning too far.
[03:06:45.540 --> 03:06:52.140]   But the credit was that he changed the
[03:06:52.140 --> 03:06:53.820]   rhetoric of the right wing.
[03:06:53.820 --> 03:06:56.140]   They went from the party of Dick Cheney,
[03:06:56.140 --> 03:07:02.180]   war is great, and let's, you know, all
[03:07:02.180 --> 03:07:05.140]   Muslims are evil and so he hates Muslims
[03:07:05.140 --> 03:07:06.180]   too, but that's a different thing.
[03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:06.780]   Right.
[03:07:06.780 --> 03:07:09.100]   But like, oh, we have to attack the enemy.
[03:07:09.100 --> 03:07:11.300]   We have to start wars, et cetera.
[03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:13.660]   To now Republican voters are generally
[03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:15.260]   anti-war and hate Dick Cheney.
[03:07:15.260 --> 03:07:16.700]   Oh, I'll take it.
[03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:17.380]   I'll take it.
[03:07:17.380 --> 03:07:18.780]   So that's a great thing that Trump did,
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:21.500]   even if he didn't mean it, even if he does
[03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:23.580]   these provocative things that could lead
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:25.820]   to a much worse war, even if I'm worried
[03:07:25.820 --> 03:07:28.060]   that he'll be so reckless, he'll start a
[03:07:28.060 --> 03:07:30.660]   bigger war, at least he did that right.
[03:07:30.660 --> 03:07:32.980]   And so I'm happy to have our, our right
[03:07:32.980 --> 03:07:35.060]   wing brothers and sisters join us in
[03:07:35.060 --> 03:07:36.260]   the anti-war movement.
[03:07:36.260 --> 03:07:38.940]   And, and I'm not being a jerk about it.
[03:07:38.940 --> 03:07:40.260]   Like I love it.
[03:07:40.260 --> 03:07:42.940]   And, and any, and so this is another
[03:07:42.940 --> 03:07:44.300]   thing the left does wrong from time to
[03:07:44.300 --> 03:07:47.180]   time, which is if you agree with a right
[03:07:47.180 --> 03:07:49.700]   wing or 2%, they'll be like, oh, welcome in.
[03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:50.780]   Come on, vote for Trump.
[03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:51.380]   Come on in.
[03:07:51.380 --> 03:07:51.580]   Yeah.
[03:07:51.580 --> 03:07:52.820]   Water's warm.
[03:07:52.820 --> 03:07:53.140]   Right.
[03:07:53.140 --> 03:07:57.700]   If you, if you disagree with the left 2%,
[03:07:57.700 --> 03:07:58.900]   they're like, that's it.
[03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:00.180]   You're banished and you're a Nazi.
[03:08:00.180 --> 03:08:02.260]   Well, brother, how are we going to win an
[03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:04.540]   election if you're banishing everybody there is.
[03:08:04.540 --> 03:08:05.260]   Right.
[03:08:05.260 --> 03:08:06.580]   So hold up.
[03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:08.340]   These Republican voters are coming
[03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:10.780]   at your anti-war position.
[03:08:10.780 --> 03:08:12.380]   Take the win.
[03:08:12.380 --> 03:08:15.460]   No, they're MAGA and I won't deal with them.
[03:08:15.460 --> 03:08:18.260]   Even when they agree with you, that
[03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:19.340]   doesn't make any sense.
[03:08:19.340 --> 03:08:20.340]   That doesn't make any sense.
[03:08:20.380 --> 03:08:21.420]   Take the win.
[03:08:21.420 --> 03:08:22.140]   Right.
[03:08:22.140 --> 03:08:23.900]   So when Charlie Kirk says yes to paid
[03:08:23.900 --> 03:08:26.060]   family leave, when Patrick Bet-David on
[03:08:26.060 --> 03:08:28.540]   his program says yes, roughly says yes to
[03:08:28.540 --> 03:08:30.740]   paid family leave, take the win.
[03:08:30.740 --> 03:08:32.540]   RFK Jr.
[03:08:32.540 --> 03:08:35.340]   You said, uh, some positive things for a
[03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:36.700]   while about RFK Jr.
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:40.020]   Uh, and I think you said you would even
[03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:44.140]   consider, uh, voting for him given the
[03:08:44.140 --> 03:08:46.220]   slate of people, this was at the time when
[03:08:46.220 --> 03:08:49.780]   Biden was, uh, still in, um, what do you
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:50.260]   think about him?
[03:08:50.260 --> 03:08:51.900]   What do you think about RFK Jr.
[03:08:51.900 --> 03:08:54.740]   As a candidate, as the person, he's been
[03:08:54.740 --> 03:08:55.420]   on the show, right?
[03:08:55.420 --> 03:08:55.740]   Yeah.
[03:08:55.740 --> 03:08:55.820]   Yeah.
[03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:57.340]   So he, he was on our show.
[03:08:57.340 --> 03:08:58.660]   People love that interview.
[03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:00.180]   You could check it out anytime, right.
[03:09:00.180 --> 03:09:03.580]   Um, and, and why do people love it?
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:05.580]   Whether they're right or left, because
[03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:07.580]   we're fair, we actually asked him about
[03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:08.540]   his policy positions.
[03:09:08.540 --> 03:09:09.340]   He explained them.
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:10.420]   I challenge him.
[03:09:10.420 --> 03:09:12.260]   And then he explains and we give him a
[03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:12.780]   fair hearing.
[03:09:12.780 --> 03:09:15.860]   But I, I knew Bobby a little bit before he
[03:09:15.860 --> 03:09:17.820]   ran when he was an environmental lawyer.
[03:09:18.220 --> 03:09:18.540]   Right.
[03:09:18.540 --> 03:09:22.420]   Uh, and his legal work is excellent.
[03:09:22.420 --> 03:09:25.780]   Um, and, and he's been on the right side
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:28.420]   of most of the issues for most of his life.
[03:09:28.420 --> 03:09:33.380]   So a, I like him on that too, on his wildlife,
[03:09:33.380 --> 03:09:35.700]   the dead bear and the worms and all that
[03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:36.380]   stuff, right?
[03:09:36.380 --> 03:09:39.740]   So there's two important lessons you
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:41.380]   should get about out of that.
[03:09:41.380 --> 03:09:43.700]   Well, one's just about Bobby, but the other
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:45.140]   one's a general one that's really important
[03:09:45.140 --> 03:09:46.780]   for you to know, no matter what you think
[03:09:46.780 --> 03:09:47.460]   of Bobby Kennedy.
[03:09:47.940 --> 03:09:49.620]   On the personal front, I have a friend
[03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:50.740]   that's very similar to him.
[03:09:50.740 --> 03:09:52.300]   In fact, he's one of my best friends.
[03:09:52.300 --> 03:09:56.020]   And, and I know why I, this is my theory
[03:09:56.020 --> 03:09:59.500]   on why Bobby and my friend are, led a
[03:09:59.500 --> 03:10:02.780]   wildlife, both of their dads died young.
[03:10:02.780 --> 03:10:05.860]   When my friend's dad died, he was 18
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:07.300]   and his dad died in his arms.
[03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:10.380]   And he has a motto, what is lived,
[03:10:10.380 --> 03:10:11.500]   cannot be unlived.
[03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:15.380]   So if I had a great time and I thought
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:17.140]   it was hilarious to dump a dead bear at
[03:10:17.140 --> 03:10:19.220]   central park, then I lived it and I had a
[03:10:19.220 --> 03:10:21.540]   great time and nothing you could do about it.
[03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:22.100]   Okay.
[03:10:22.100 --> 03:10:25.460]   And sometimes that'll get you in trouble.
[03:10:25.460 --> 03:10:29.020]   And sometimes you'll have a fantastic time.
[03:10:29.020 --> 03:10:29.540]   Right.
[03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:33.060]   And, and obviously Bobby's dad was
[03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:34.380]   killed when he was young.
[03:10:34.380 --> 03:10:36.940]   And maybe that got into his head of like,
[03:10:36.940 --> 03:10:40.500]   you better live strong and, and, you
[03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:42.020]   know, live an interesting life.
[03:10:42.020 --> 03:10:44.260]   And so I don't begrudge him that even if
[03:10:44.260 --> 03:10:46.180]   I begrudge some of the things that he did
[03:10:46.260 --> 03:10:48.660]   in that life, I get why he did it.
[03:10:48.660 --> 03:10:51.140]   So I don't hate him like other people hate
[03:10:51.140 --> 03:10:52.900]   him for some of those personal stuff.
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:53.380]   Right.
[03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:55.340]   So, and I like him for all the things
[03:10:55.340 --> 03:10:57.900]   that he did positive, holding, uh, you
[03:10:57.900 --> 03:11:00.380]   know, fossil fuel companies accountable,
[03:11:00.380 --> 03:11:03.180]   protecting communities that had poison
[03:11:03.180 --> 03:11:04.780]   dumped into their rivers, et cetera.
[03:11:04.780 --> 03:11:05.100]   Right.
[03:11:05.100 --> 03:11:08.660]   So the thing that affects everybody is when
[03:11:08.660 --> 03:11:12.000]   he gets, like corporate media smeared the
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.620]   hell out of him and they didn't allow him
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:16.700]   to speak, and then they did the needle
[03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:17.780]   in a haystack trick.
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:21.860]   So whenever it's an insider, they find
[03:11:21.860 --> 03:11:23.980]   the best parts of their lives and then
[03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:25.900]   they amplify.
[03:11:25.900 --> 03:11:29.460]   So Joe Biden is average Joe from Scranton.
[03:11:29.460 --> 03:11:32.100]   Motherfuckers been in DC for the last 52
[03:11:32.100 --> 03:11:32.340]   years.
[03:11:32.340 --> 03:11:33.700]   You think we don't have eyes and ears?
[03:11:33.700 --> 03:11:34.700]   Okay.
[03:11:34.700 --> 03:11:36.820]   Like average show from Scranton.
[03:11:36.820 --> 03:11:37.900]   Who are you kidding?
[03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:39.940]   So there's a guy named Fred Thompson.
[03:11:39.940 --> 03:11:41.340]   He was an actor and he was a Senator
[03:11:41.340 --> 03:11:42.460]   from Tennessee later.
[03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:44.260]   And he had this great little trick
[03:11:44.260 --> 03:11:45.740]   that he would do is a red pickup truck
[03:11:45.740 --> 03:11:46.820]   that he would campaign with.
[03:11:46.820 --> 03:11:47.180]   Right.
[03:11:47.180 --> 03:11:48.580]   So he looks like a regular Joe, right.
[03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:51.180]   But he's a millionaire actor, but
[03:11:51.180 --> 03:11:51.940]   here's the funny part.
[03:11:51.940 --> 03:11:53.540]   He would drive to the red pickup
[03:11:53.540 --> 03:11:57.100]   truck in a limo, and he would drive back
[03:11:57.100 --> 03:11:59.220]   from the campaign event in a limo, but
[03:11:59.220 --> 03:12:01.740]   the press never reported the limo.
[03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:03.820]   They only reported him in the red pickup
[03:12:03.820 --> 03:12:05.460]   truck as if that's what he drives.
[03:12:05.460 --> 03:12:08.620]   See, that's the theater of politics.
[03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:09.460]   Why?
[03:12:09.460 --> 03:12:11.860]   Cause Fred Thompson was a corporate
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:13.340]   Republican, so they loved him.
[03:12:13.580 --> 03:12:14.980]   So they go, yeah, sure.
[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:15.260]   Yeah.
[03:12:15.260 --> 03:12:16.180]   Red pickup truck.
[03:12:16.180 --> 03:12:17.620]   Oh, good old Fred Thompson.
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:17.940]   Right.
[03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:20.540]   So, but if you're an outsider
[03:12:20.540 --> 03:12:22.700]   and they don't like you, then they're
[03:12:22.700 --> 03:12:24.020]   going to look at the haystack of your
[03:12:24.020 --> 03:12:26.100]   life and they're going to try to find needles.
[03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:28.420]   So they've done this to Trump.
[03:12:28.420 --> 03:12:29.500]   They've done this to Bernie.
[03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:31.580]   They've done this to Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[03:12:31.580 --> 03:12:35.140]   Uh, and with, with Bobby, they're
[03:12:35.140 --> 03:12:37.820]   like, Ooh, there's some juicy needles in here.
[03:12:37.820 --> 03:12:38.860]   Okay.
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:40.900]   So they find those and they go, you see
[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:43.060]   this, the only thing you should know
[03:12:43.060 --> 03:12:45.420]   about Bobby Kennedy Jr is that he found
[03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:47.380]   a dead bear and put it in central park.
[03:12:47.380 --> 03:12:48.900]   Uh, Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[03:12:48.900 --> 03:12:49.540]   I found another one.
[03:12:49.540 --> 03:12:51.260]   The other thing you should know about
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:53.700]   Bobby is that he once said in a divorce
[03:12:53.700 --> 03:12:55.620]   deposition that he had a brain worm.
[03:12:55.620 --> 03:12:57.540]   That, uh, by the way, it turns out that
[03:12:57.540 --> 03:12:59.060]   affects millions of people and it's
[03:12:59.060 --> 03:13:00.260]   not that big a deal, right?
[03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:02.700]   But look, he is a radical.
[03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:03.540]   Ah, he is.
[03:13:03.540 --> 03:13:05.060]   This defines him completely.
[03:13:05.060 --> 03:13:07.020]   The spectacular case of that
[03:13:07.020 --> 03:13:07.900]   actually happened to me.
[03:13:07.900 --> 03:13:11.940]   So I ran for Congress in 2020 and the
[03:13:11.940 --> 03:13:14.500]   New York times, LA times, CNN, they all
[03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:16.980]   butchered me with needles.
[03:13:16.980 --> 03:13:17.940]   Okay.
[03:13:17.940 --> 03:13:20.740]   So they said, is a long history
[03:13:20.740 --> 03:13:22.300]   of making anti-Muslim jokes.
[03:13:22.300 --> 03:13:24.700]   Well, first of all, they didn't even say
[03:13:24.700 --> 03:13:27.220]   jokes, they said anti-Muslim rhetoric.
[03:13:27.220 --> 03:13:30.700]   I'm like, I'm Muslim.
[03:13:30.700 --> 03:13:33.420]   I mean, I'm an atheist, but I grew up Muslim.
[03:13:33.420 --> 03:13:34.260]   My family's Muslim.
[03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:35.300]   My background's Muslim.
[03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:37.980]   You don't think that's relevant in the story?
[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:40.940]   And they did it based on one joke I told
[03:13:40.940 --> 03:13:43.140]   about, and they said, oh, I also, of course,
[03:13:43.140 --> 03:13:45.220]   I mean, they say that I'm anti-Semitic.
[03:13:45.220 --> 03:13:47.220]   That's like, that's, you start with that.
[03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:49.380]   That's, that's just baked in for everyone.
[03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:49.880]   Right.
[03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:52.700]   So they said, I had made a joke about
[03:13:52.700 --> 03:13:57.420]   how Orthodox Jews and Muslims, they think
[03:13:57.420 --> 03:13:58.620]   that getting into heaven is a little
[03:13:58.620 --> 03:14:00.500]   bit of a fashion contest.
[03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:01.160]   Okay.
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:03.700]   So they, the Orthodox Jews go in there
[03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:05.820]   with a Russian coats from the 1800s and
[03:14:05.820 --> 03:14:07.860]   the giant Russian hat, you know, the
[03:14:07.860 --> 03:14:09.860]   Muslims go in with their robe and the skull
[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:12.700]   cap and stuff, and God's looking around
[03:14:12.700 --> 03:14:14.940]   going, no, no, no, ooh, nice outfit.
[03:14:14.940 --> 03:14:15.500]   Come on in.
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:16.080]   Right.
[03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:18.980]   Like, do you really think the creator
[03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:20.860]   of the universe gives a damn what you wear?
[03:14:20.860 --> 03:14:21.800]   Okay.
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:23.700]   So the New York Times took that and
[03:14:23.700 --> 03:14:26.060]   said, long history of being anti-Semitic
[03:14:26.060 --> 03:14:26.700]   and anti-Muslim.
[03:14:26.700 --> 03:14:27.440]   Right.
[03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:27.940]   Okay.
[03:14:27.940 --> 03:14:30.460]   So there's this, oh, this is a famous one.
[03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:32.020]   Relatively.
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:32.520]   Right.
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:35.460]   I did a joke about bestiality like.
[03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:36.400]   Nice.
[03:14:36.400 --> 03:14:37.420]   A dozen years ago.
[03:14:37.420 --> 03:14:38.380]   Very nice.
[03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:40.660]   So I start out the joke nice and dry and
[03:14:40.660 --> 03:14:43.260]   I go, look, is the horse going to object
[03:14:43.260 --> 03:14:44.980]   if he's the one getting pleasure?
[03:14:44.980 --> 03:14:46.940]   Now, Anna's my co-host.
[03:14:46.940 --> 03:14:48.420]   She's younger at that time.
[03:14:48.420 --> 03:14:50.980]   And she's like, that seems like a bad idea.
[03:14:50.980 --> 03:14:52.460]   I'm like, of course it's a bad idea.
[03:14:52.460 --> 03:14:53.080]   Okay.
[03:14:53.080 --> 03:14:55.180]   But I'm being dry, but some people are
[03:14:55.180 --> 03:14:56.420]   laughing in the studio and stuff.
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:14:59.700]   And then, and then I say, you know, if I
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:01.700]   was emperor of the world, I would make that
[03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:03.860]   legal and they cut the tape.
[03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:06.940]   If you watch the rest of the tape, I say,
[03:15:06.980 --> 03:15:08.220]   now would the horse object?
[03:15:08.220 --> 03:15:09.300]   Nah.
[03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:13.140]   So, but they cut the tape.
[03:15:13.140 --> 03:15:16.460]   So the New York, so originally a right-winger
[03:15:16.460 --> 03:15:19.940]   did that and then a, like a, uh, establishment
[03:15:19.940 --> 03:15:23.100]   troll, uh, in that primary started putting
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:24.620]   out those tapes to everyone.
[03:15:24.620 --> 03:15:26.380]   Jake Tapper retweeted it.
[03:15:26.380 --> 03:15:29.780]   Didn't look to see if it's edited or not edited.
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:32.980]   The New York times implied that bestiality
[03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:34.380]   was part of my agenda.
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:35.240]   Agenda.
[03:15:35.240 --> 03:15:36.180]   Jesus Christ.
[03:15:36.180 --> 03:15:38.060]   Please tell me that's part of your Wikipedia.
[03:15:38.060 --> 03:15:41.100]   That, that, that, that, that the bestiality
[03:15:41.100 --> 03:15:41.900]   thing is part of your.
[03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:42.660]   I don't know.
[03:15:42.660 --> 03:15:46.100]   I don't know, but guys, so in that, in those
[03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:47.740]   stories, I'm not important.
[03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:49.100]   And even Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[03:15:49.100 --> 03:15:49.780]   is not important.
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:53.020]   What it reveals about the media is what's
[03:15:53.020 --> 03:15:55.220]   important, so they're going to find those
[03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:57.300]   needles, whether it's, and even if they
[03:15:57.300 --> 03:15:58.620]   don't have the needles, you know what, we'll
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:01.180]   cut the tape before your joke, uh, joke's
[03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:02.300]   punchline, right?
[03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:04.500]   So we'll just run it and we'll lie about you.
[03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:06.180]   Who cares, right?
[03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:10.140]   And so, oh, they also said that I had David
[03:16:10.140 --> 03:16:12.740]   Duke on to share his anti-Semitic point of view.
[03:16:12.740 --> 03:16:15.580]   If you watch the interview, I told David
[03:16:15.580 --> 03:16:17.860]   Duke, you're an anti-Semite, you're a racist,
[03:16:17.860 --> 03:16:19.820]   you're a bigot, you're an idiot, right?
[03:16:19.820 --> 03:16:21.620]   It was the toughest interview he's probably
[03:16:21.620 --> 03:16:22.700]   ever had in his life.
[03:16:22.700 --> 03:16:25.580]   And other journalists got mad at that part.
[03:16:25.580 --> 03:16:28.060]   And they were like, no guys, you're
[03:16:28.060 --> 03:16:29.180]   just flat out lying.
[03:16:29.180 --> 03:16:31.180]   Like I, I watched the interview.
[03:16:31.180 --> 03:16:32.580]   Did any of you watch the interview?
[03:16:32.860 --> 03:16:34.660]   He takes the guy's head off, right?
[03:16:34.660 --> 03:16:36.620]   And so the New York times issued a
[03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:37.540]   correction on that one.
[03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:39.300]   So they're like, okay, fine.
[03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:41.860]   He was being sarcastic when he said, sure,
[03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:43.100]   you're not racist, Dave.
[03:16:43.100 --> 03:16:46.820]   Well, it's the, one of the sources of hope
[03:16:46.820 --> 03:16:49.060]   to all of this is there's a lot of, uh,
[03:16:49.060 --> 03:16:50.780]   independent media now.
[03:16:50.780 --> 03:16:54.020]   Um, but mainstream media has a lot of power
[03:16:54.020 --> 03:16:55.740]   still and cares a lot of power.
[03:16:55.740 --> 03:16:57.500]   Do you think they're going to die eventually?
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:16:58.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[03:16:58.180 --> 03:17:00.780]   So two things about that that are super
[03:17:00.780 --> 03:17:03.420]   important, first of all, this is why I tell
[03:17:03.420 --> 03:17:04.100]   people to have hope.
[03:17:04.100 --> 03:17:05.620]   I don't believe in false hope, right?
[03:17:05.620 --> 03:17:07.820]   So if you think Kamala Harris is your
[03:17:07.820 --> 03:17:09.780]   knight in shining armor, she's going to come
[03:17:09.780 --> 03:17:11.580]   in, she's going to get money out of politics.
[03:17:11.580 --> 03:17:12.700]   She's going to ignore the donors.
[03:17:12.700 --> 03:17:13.420]   That's false hope.
[03:17:13.420 --> 03:17:14.740]   It's crazy talk, right?
[03:17:14.740 --> 03:17:17.140]   So I, why am I in favor of Kamala Harris?
[03:17:17.140 --> 03:17:18.380]   I'm going to live to fight another day.
[03:17:18.380 --> 03:17:19.540]   I'm worried that Trump's going to end the
[03:17:19.540 --> 03:17:20.820]   whole thing, and then we're not going to
[03:17:20.820 --> 03:17:23.380]   have an opportunity to actually get a
[03:17:23.380 --> 03:17:24.700]   populist win, right?
[03:17:24.700 --> 03:17:26.980]   So, and I'm encouraged by some
[03:17:26.980 --> 03:17:27.700]   of the things she's doing.
[03:17:27.700 --> 03:17:29.540]   Maybe she does even 25% of her agenda, but
[03:17:29.540 --> 03:17:31.260]   I'm not going to give you false hope that
[03:17:31.260 --> 03:17:32.820]   she's your savior, right?
[03:17:32.820 --> 03:17:35.020]   But I believe massively in hope.
[03:17:35.020 --> 03:17:39.100]   And number one, because it's true to, to
[03:17:39.100 --> 03:17:40.420]   the point that we were talking about earlier,
[03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:44.900]   Lex, and how last 200 years have been choppy,
[03:17:44.900 --> 03:17:47.580]   but overall fantastic, terrible things have
[03:17:47.580 --> 03:17:48.860]   happened in that time period.
[03:17:48.860 --> 03:17:49.860]   Some of the worst things that have ever
[03:17:49.860 --> 03:17:51.660]   happened in history, but overall life
[03:17:51.660 --> 03:17:52.820]   expectancy is higher.
[03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:55.140]   Everything is, you know, incomes are higher,
[03:17:55.140 --> 03:17:56.380]   health is better, et cetera.
[03:17:56.380 --> 03:17:56.700]   Right.
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:17:58.900]   So hope is not misplaced.
[03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:00.940]   It's real, it's empirical.
[03:18:00.940 --> 03:18:01.780]   Okay.
[03:18:01.780 --> 03:18:04.380]   So now we talked about how you could get
[03:18:04.380 --> 03:18:06.060]   money out of politics and that's a legitimate
[03:18:06.060 --> 03:18:10.260]   hope, but media is another place where
[03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:11.340]   we have huge hope.
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:14.500]   So of all the corporate robots, the most
[03:18:14.500 --> 03:18:16.220]   important robot is media.
[03:18:16.220 --> 03:18:19.860]   So when mainstream media has you hooked
[03:18:19.860 --> 03:18:21.940]   in at the back of your neck, you're going
[03:18:21.940 --> 03:18:24.140]   to believe all these fairy tales about how
[03:18:24.140 --> 03:18:26.100]   politicians are nice people, and they're
[03:18:26.100 --> 03:18:27.700]   trying to do the right thing and donor money
[03:18:27.700 --> 03:18:29.380]   doesn't have any influence on them, right.
[03:18:29.380 --> 03:18:34.060]   So once you unplug from the matrix, um, well,
[03:18:34.060 --> 03:18:35.940]   then you begin to see, oh yeah, hey, look,
[03:18:35.940 --> 03:18:37.260]   he took the donor money to do what the
[03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:37.900]   donors wanted.
[03:18:37.900 --> 03:18:39.380]   He took the donor money to do what the donors
[03:18:39.380 --> 03:18:41.100]   want, 98% of the time, right.
[03:18:41.100 --> 03:18:44.580]   So then you see clearly, so now what's
[03:18:44.580 --> 03:18:47.660]   happening at large, mainstream media is
[03:18:47.660 --> 03:18:51.380]   losing their power and now online media
[03:18:51.380 --> 03:18:53.980]   swarming, swarming, swarming, swarming.
[03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:56.540]   And so this goes back to why I started
[03:18:56.540 --> 03:18:57.260]   The Young Turks.
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:18:59.820]   So let me touch on that here and then we
[03:18:59.820 --> 03:19:00.740]   can come back to it if you want.
[03:19:00.740 --> 03:19:05.740]   So in 1998, I write an email to my friends
[03:19:05.740 --> 03:19:08.700]   and I say, online video is going to be
[03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:12.700]   television and unsurprisingly, and they
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:14.420]   say, you're nuts.
[03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:15.540]   That's never going to happen.
[03:19:15.540 --> 03:19:18.020]   At that point, we're still doing AOL
[03:19:18.020 --> 03:19:20.180]   dial-ups like, right.
[03:19:20.180 --> 03:19:22.980]   The online video barely exists and
[03:19:22.980 --> 03:19:24.580]   television's mammoth.
[03:19:25.060 --> 03:19:27.820]   I say, guys, it's just a matter of logic.
[03:19:27.820 --> 03:19:31.500]   Like for me, it's, there's so many ironies.
[03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:33.940]   I'm known for yelling online sometimes,
[03:19:33.940 --> 03:19:36.540]   but in reality, I'm obsessed with logic.
[03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:40.700]   So when you have gatekeepers, gatekeepers
[03:19:40.700 --> 03:19:42.980]   pick based on what they want, what the
[03:19:42.980 --> 03:19:44.780]   powerful want, in that case, advertisers,
[03:19:44.780 --> 03:19:46.740]   politicians, et cetera, they are never
[03:19:46.740 --> 03:19:49.060]   going to design programming as good as
[03:19:49.060 --> 03:19:49.980]   wisdom of the crowd.
[03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:53.660]   When people start doing online video,
[03:19:53.660 --> 03:19:55.380]   I'm like, boom, there's no gatekeepers.
[03:19:55.380 --> 03:19:56.660]   This is democratized.
[03:19:56.660 --> 03:19:58.060]   Wisdom of the crowd is going to win.
[03:19:58.060 --> 03:20:01.740]   So if you start with no money and let's
[03:20:01.740 --> 03:20:03.340]   pick a different example, not the Young Turks,
[03:20:03.340 --> 03:20:05.220]   let's say Phil DeFranco, he's been around
[03:20:05.220 --> 03:20:06.380]   forever, okay.
[03:20:06.380 --> 03:20:09.220]   And, uh, and he also does news.
[03:20:09.220 --> 03:20:13.380]   And so Phil starts doing a show and he
[03:20:13.380 --> 03:20:15.620]   doesn't have any money, just like us.
[03:20:15.620 --> 03:20:17.620]   And so what does he, what does he have
[03:20:17.620 --> 03:20:18.580]   to do to get an audience?
[03:20:18.580 --> 03:20:20.780]   He has to do a show that is really popular.
[03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:22.860]   He's got to figure out a way.
[03:20:22.860 --> 03:20:24.220]   How do I get their attention?
[03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:26.020]   How do I keep their attention?
[03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:27.900]   And he starts doing a great show.
[03:20:27.900 --> 03:20:28.620]   Right.
[03:20:28.620 --> 03:20:31.260]   And so every year it's us and Phil for best
[03:20:31.260 --> 03:20:32.620]   news show for like a decade.
[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:32.940]   Right.
[03:20:32.940 --> 03:20:37.860]   And meanwhile, I'm back over at CNN, Wolf
[03:20:37.860 --> 03:20:40.300]   Blitzer still droning on from a teleprompter.
[03:20:40.300 --> 03:20:44.020]   You put Wolf Blitzer online without the
[03:20:44.020 --> 03:20:45.340]   force of CNN with him.
[03:20:45.340 --> 03:20:47.380]   He gets negative seven views.
[03:20:47.380 --> 03:20:49.820]   No, one's interested in what Wolf Blitzer
[03:20:49.820 --> 03:20:50.140]   has to say.
[03:20:50.140 --> 03:20:50.860]   It's not personal.
[03:20:50.860 --> 03:20:52.300]   I don't know the brother, right.
[03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:53.980]   I'm just saying institutionally,
[03:20:53.980 --> 03:20:55.180]   logically, et cetera.
[03:20:55.180 --> 03:20:57.300]   So I'm like, these guys are going to win.
[03:20:57.300 --> 03:21:00.700]   So when YouTube starts, we go on YouTube
[03:21:00.700 --> 03:21:02.540]   right away, we're the first YouTube partner.
[03:21:02.540 --> 03:21:05.380]   So I am literally the original YouTuber.
[03:21:05.380 --> 03:21:07.860]   Nice.
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:11.300]   Susan Wojcicki, the former CEO of the
[03:21:11.300 --> 03:21:14.060]   late Susan Wojcicki, a wonderful woman.
[03:21:14.060 --> 03:21:16.460]   And if that triggers you again on the right,
[03:21:16.460 --> 03:21:19.340]   you're wrong, she was a terrific person.
[03:21:19.820 --> 03:21:22.860]   And, um, and she, when she started her own
[03:21:22.860 --> 03:21:25.900]   YouTube channel, uh, I was the first interview
[03:21:25.900 --> 03:21:27.300]   cause we were the first YouTube partner.
[03:21:27.300 --> 03:21:30.180]   So, so I love that.
[03:21:30.180 --> 03:21:33.020]   So we're in that, but let me connect
[03:21:33.020 --> 03:21:33.860]   it back to the hope.
[03:21:33.860 --> 03:21:36.980]   When mainstream media has you hooked, you've
[03:21:36.980 --> 03:21:39.260]   got no hope because you don't have the right
[03:21:39.260 --> 03:21:41.860]   information, you have propaganda, you have
[03:21:41.860 --> 03:21:43.740]   marketing, you don't have real news.
[03:21:43.740 --> 03:21:46.900]   When you're in the online world, it's chaotic
[03:21:46.900 --> 03:21:48.900]   and don't get me wrong, it's got plenty
[03:21:48.900 --> 03:21:50.100]   of downsides, right?
[03:21:50.100 --> 03:21:54.620]   But within that chaos, the truth begins to emerge.
[03:21:54.620 --> 03:21:57.180]   And so, for example, Young Turks has had
[03:21:57.180 --> 03:21:58.940]   dozens of fights with different creators
[03:21:58.940 --> 03:21:59.580]   throughout history.
[03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:00.140]   Why?
[03:22:00.140 --> 03:22:02.900]   When you're number one in news online, the
[03:22:02.900 --> 03:22:05.700]   algorithm rewards anyone attacking you because
[03:22:05.700 --> 03:22:07.620]   then you get into their algorithmic loop.
[03:22:07.620 --> 03:22:09.940]   It's not an accident that we've been
[03:22:09.940 --> 03:22:11.220]   attacked dozens of times.
[03:22:11.220 --> 03:22:13.300]   One, we're independent thinkers.
[03:22:13.300 --> 03:22:15.180]   So anyone, if we don't match their ideology,
[03:22:15.180 --> 03:22:15.900]   they're going to attack us.
[03:22:15.900 --> 03:22:18.500]   But number two, they get in our algorithm loop.
[03:22:18.540 --> 03:22:20.380]   It's too hard to resist, right?
[03:22:20.380 --> 03:22:22.380]   So all of a sudden they think that we're
[03:22:22.380 --> 03:22:25.140]   being funded by Nancy Pelosi or the CIA and
[03:22:25.140 --> 03:22:26.380]   then, oh, we're off to the races.
[03:22:26.380 --> 03:22:27.740]   There's another fight, right?
[03:22:27.740 --> 03:22:30.140]   But our competition is a graveyard.
[03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:35.740]   And so we've won almost all of those fights.
[03:22:35.740 --> 03:22:36.700]   Why?
[03:22:36.700 --> 03:22:40.060]   Because we try really hard to stick with
[03:22:40.060 --> 03:22:42.980]   the truth, with logic, and we don't do
[03:22:42.980 --> 03:22:43.860]   audience capture.
[03:22:43.860 --> 03:22:45.900]   Even if our audience is going in one
[03:22:45.900 --> 03:22:47.300]   direction, we don't think it's right.
[03:22:47.660 --> 03:22:49.780]   We'll, Anna and I will come out and go, no,
[03:22:49.780 --> 03:22:52.060]   sorry guys, love you, but rent control is
[03:22:52.060 --> 03:22:52.740]   not a good idea.
[03:22:52.740 --> 03:22:53.540]   Okay.
[03:22:53.540 --> 03:22:54.780]   Et cetera.
[03:22:54.780 --> 03:22:59.700]   So in that world, the people, it's going
[03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:01.700]   to take a while guys, but people who are
[03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:03.380]   telling the truth are eventually going to
[03:23:03.380 --> 03:23:06.700]   rise up and when they do, now we're free.
[03:23:06.700 --> 03:23:08.900]   And now the second part is even more
[03:23:08.900 --> 03:23:10.460]   devastating for mainstream media because
[03:23:10.460 --> 03:23:11.780]   I'm a businessman, right?
[03:23:11.780 --> 03:23:16.540]   I keep looking at the revenue for CNN, et
[03:23:16.540 --> 03:23:19.940]   cetera, and they have a massive problem and
[03:23:19.940 --> 03:23:22.060]   people don't realize how big the problem is.
[03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:24.060]   That thing's going to capsize.
[03:23:24.060 --> 03:23:26.980]   I don't talk about it often cause I don't
[03:23:26.980 --> 03:23:28.020]   want more competition.
[03:23:28.020 --> 03:23:29.060]   Okay.
[03:23:29.060 --> 03:23:31.900]   I also have a company, right, in, in the
[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:33.020]   online world, et cetera.
[03:23:33.020 --> 03:23:35.900]   But, but, but I'm too honest.
[03:23:35.900 --> 03:23:36.580]   I gotta say it.
[03:23:36.580 --> 03:23:37.220]   I gotta say it.
[03:23:37.220 --> 03:23:40.180]   So they're, they have two revenue streams.
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:41.300]   One is ads.
[03:23:41.300 --> 03:23:43.140]   That's why they serve advertisers and
[03:23:43.140 --> 03:23:45.060]   politicians are huge advertisers, as we
[03:23:45.060 --> 03:23:48.300]   mentioned, the second, uh, revenue stream.
[03:23:48.300 --> 03:23:50.260]   Uh, depending on the company is arguably
[03:23:50.260 --> 03:23:52.660]   more important, which is subscribers.
[03:23:52.660 --> 03:23:56.140]   So now what happens in a business normally
[03:23:56.140 --> 03:23:59.580]   is, uh, so they started out low and then
[03:23:59.580 --> 03:24:01.500]   they got high and now they got a ton of
[03:24:01.500 --> 03:24:05.140]   subscribers at its peak cable, uh, has a
[03:24:05.140 --> 03:24:07.140]   hundred million households, right?
[03:24:07.140 --> 03:24:10.500]   So they're raking in unbelievable money
[03:24:10.500 --> 03:24:12.220]   from subscriber fees and they got
[03:24:12.220 --> 03:24:13.260]   advertising on top.
[03:24:13.660 --> 03:24:15.140]   So when you're all the way up here,
[03:24:15.140 --> 03:24:16.620]   your costs start to rise.
[03:24:16.620 --> 03:24:17.780]   Why do they rise?
[03:24:17.780 --> 03:24:20.020]   Because then the on-air talent has
[03:24:20.020 --> 03:24:22.220]   leverage and, uh, as an example, there's
[03:24:22.220 --> 03:24:23.140]   many others, yes.
[03:24:23.140 --> 03:24:26.140]   The, and so the on-air talent, like Sean
[03:24:26.140 --> 03:24:27.900]   Hannity says, I do a program that brings
[03:24:27.900 --> 03:24:30.020]   in X amount of maybe a hundred million,
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:30.900]   maybe 200 million.
[03:24:30.900 --> 03:24:32.620]   So give me 40 million a year.
[03:24:32.620 --> 03:24:36.300]   And they do, Sean is making 40 million
[03:24:36.300 --> 03:24:37.700]   a year last I checked.
[03:24:37.700 --> 03:24:38.380]   Okay.
[03:24:38.380 --> 03:24:39.900]   So I don't know if he's still getting that
[03:24:39.900 --> 03:24:41.580]   kind of money and I'm just basing it on
[03:24:41.580 --> 03:24:43.900]   reporting, right, but that's a monster.
[03:24:43.900 --> 03:24:45.660]   So they have all these giant costs, but
[03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:48.260]   the minute you lose, you go from a hundred
[03:24:48.260 --> 03:24:49.940]   million, now we're at, I think around 70
[03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:52.780]   million, you just lost a giant chunk of your
[03:24:52.780 --> 03:24:53.100]   revenue.
[03:24:53.100 --> 03:24:56.220]   Now, when your costs are higher than your
[03:24:56.220 --> 03:24:59.180]   revenue, nighty night, it's been nice knowing
[03:24:59.180 --> 03:24:59.340]   you.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:01.380]   Yeah.
[03:25:01.380 --> 03:25:02.580]   It's going to collapse and it's
[03:25:02.580 --> 03:25:03.380]   going to be painful.
[03:25:03.380 --> 03:25:05.580]   But what we need guys, it's like, sorry,
[03:25:05.580 --> 03:25:08.380]   last thing on that is we need the print guys
[03:25:08.380 --> 03:25:12.620]   like AP, Reuters, Intercept, the lever, the
[03:25:12.620 --> 03:25:15.020]   Serota runs, whatever Ryan's working on now.
[03:25:15.020 --> 03:25:15.940]   It's that Ryan Grimm.
[03:25:15.940 --> 03:25:18.300]   So we need those badly.
[03:25:18.300 --> 03:25:20.540]   We need someone to collect actual
[03:25:20.540 --> 03:25:22.980]   information and do the best they can and
[03:25:22.980 --> 03:25:24.580]   presenting it in an objective way.
[03:25:24.580 --> 03:25:26.260]   We all got to support that.
[03:25:26.260 --> 03:25:28.260]   So you can't lose texts.
[03:25:28.260 --> 03:25:29.460]   That's so important.
[03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:31.380]   The TV guys are just actors.
[03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:32.900]   You can lose them overnight and it won't
[03:25:32.900 --> 03:25:33.220]   hurt you.
[03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:33.740]   It'll help you.
[03:25:33.740 --> 03:25:34.380]   Yeah.
[03:25:34.460 --> 03:25:38.420]   Just, it's going to be a messy battle for
[03:25:38.420 --> 03:25:41.740]   truth because the reality is there's a lot
[03:25:41.740 --> 03:25:44.020]   of money to be made and a lot of attention
[03:25:44.020 --> 03:25:45.940]   to be gained from drama farming.
[03:25:45.940 --> 03:25:49.540]   So just constantly creating drama and
[03:25:49.540 --> 03:25:52.860]   sometimes drama helps find the truth like
[03:25:52.860 --> 03:25:54.620]   we were mentioning, but most of the time
[03:25:54.620 --> 03:25:57.060]   it's just drama and it can, it doesn't care
[03:25:57.060 --> 03:25:57.580]   about the truth.
[03:25:57.580 --> 03:25:58.620]   It just cares about drama.
[03:25:58.620 --> 03:26:01.100]   And then the same as a conspiracy theories.
[03:26:01.100 --> 03:26:03.820]   Now some conspiracy theories have value
[03:26:03.820 --> 03:26:06.900]   in depth and they allow us to question the
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:10.500]   establishment institutions, but the bottom
[03:26:10.500 --> 03:26:12.860]   line is conspiracy theories get clicks.
[03:26:12.860 --> 03:26:14.940]   And so you can just keep coming up with
[03:26:14.940 --> 03:26:15.940]   random conspiracy theories.
[03:26:15.940 --> 03:26:18.380]   Many of them don't have to be grounded in
[03:26:18.380 --> 03:26:19.060]   the truth at all.
[03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:21.820]   And so that's the seat we're operating in.
[03:26:21.820 --> 03:26:24.940]   And so it's a tricky space too.
[03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:27.460]   But Lex, look at all the people who are
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:29.940]   the biggest now, because we've now had a
[03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:31.420]   couple of decades at this, right?
[03:26:31.820 --> 03:26:37.980]   So, uh, I mean, as an industry, so I would
[03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:40.940]   argue you're huge and you don't do that.
[03:26:40.940 --> 03:26:42.500]   You don't do the conspiracy theories.
[03:26:42.500 --> 03:26:44.020]   You don't do the drama at all.
[03:26:44.020 --> 03:26:44.460]   Right.
[03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:47.020]   Um, Rogan is huge.
[03:26:47.020 --> 03:26:47.300]   Yeah.
[03:26:47.300 --> 03:26:49.740]   Maybe there's drama, but he's genuine, right?
[03:26:49.740 --> 03:26:52.340]   I got a lot of issues with some of his
[03:26:52.340 --> 03:26:55.220]   policies, mixed opinions on Joe in a lot
[03:26:55.220 --> 03:26:57.380]   of different ways, but I don't doubt that
[03:26:57.380 --> 03:26:59.980]   he's genuine and people can sense that.
[03:26:59.980 --> 03:27:00.940]   Right.
[03:27:01.180 --> 03:27:02.140]   And he's huge.
[03:27:02.140 --> 03:27:03.020]   We're genuine.
[03:27:03.020 --> 03:27:03.860]   We're huge.
[03:27:03.860 --> 03:27:07.340]   So this is the market beginning to work.
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:07.780]   Yeah.
[03:27:07.780 --> 03:27:11.020]   So speaking of Joe, let me ask you about this.
[03:27:11.020 --> 03:27:13.460]   Here we go.
[03:27:13.460 --> 03:27:15.380]   I didn't actually know this, but when I was
[03:27:15.380 --> 03:27:17.540]   prepping for this conversation, I saw that
[03:27:17.540 --> 03:27:19.260]   you actually said at some point in the past
[03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:21.380]   that you can beat up Rogan in a fight.
[03:27:21.380 --> 03:27:22.060]   Yeah.
[03:27:22.060 --> 03:27:23.940]   No, you said that you have a shot.
[03:27:23.940 --> 03:27:25.420]   It's a non-zero probability.
[03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:25.780]   Yes.
[03:27:25.780 --> 03:27:26.940]   Do you still believe this?
[03:27:26.940 --> 03:27:27.780]   Yes.
[03:27:27.780 --> 03:27:29.420]   But the probability is dropping.
[03:27:30.380 --> 03:27:31.460]   It's dropping every day.
[03:27:31.460 --> 03:27:34.100]   I think it's the, probably the stupidest
[03:27:34.100 --> 03:27:35.500]   thing I've ever heard you say.
[03:27:35.500 --> 03:27:37.980]   So I did martial arts, I wrestled and did
[03:27:37.980 --> 03:27:40.140]   jujitsu and judo and all the kinds of fighting
[03:27:40.140 --> 03:27:41.060]   sports my whole life.
[03:27:41.060 --> 03:27:44.940]   And I just observed a lot of really confident,
[03:27:44.940 --> 03:27:48.660]   large guys roll into gyms.
[03:27:48.660 --> 03:27:49.740]   He's ripped.
[03:27:49.740 --> 03:27:50.700]   He can deadlift.
[03:27:50.700 --> 03:27:52.860]   He can talk all kinds of shit and he believes
[03:27:52.860 --> 03:27:55.060]   he's going to be the next world champion and
[03:27:55.060 --> 03:27:56.340]   he just gets his ass kicked.
[03:27:56.340 --> 03:27:56.740]   Yeah.
[03:27:56.740 --> 03:27:59.300]   Of course.
[03:27:59.300 --> 03:27:59.780]   Okay.
[03:27:59.780 --> 03:28:04.180]   And I've seen, like, I saw this Israeli MMA
[03:28:04.180 --> 03:28:06.940]   fighter take on an anti-Semite who was huge
[03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:09.020]   and thought that, you know, he believed in
[03:28:09.020 --> 03:28:11.020]   like Nick Fuentes' conspiracy theories or
[03:28:11.020 --> 03:28:14.340]   something and the MMA fighter dismantled him.
[03:28:14.340 --> 03:28:15.380]   And I loved it.
[03:28:15.380 --> 03:28:15.940]   Okay.
[03:28:15.940 --> 03:28:17.620]   And then he like, we tweeted back and forth,
[03:28:17.620 --> 03:28:18.180]   et cetera.
[03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:21.740]   So guys, first, let me just assure you, I get it.
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:26.540]   So now let me tell you why I said it and then
[03:28:26.540 --> 03:28:28.140]   why I think it's a non-zero chance.
[03:28:28.580 --> 03:28:32.460]   So Michael Smirkonish had written this blog,
[03:28:32.460 --> 03:28:35.660]   like, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago on
[03:28:35.660 --> 03:28:37.540]   Huffington Post, we were both bloggers at that
[03:28:37.540 --> 03:28:40.220]   point, about the wussification of America.
[03:28:40.220 --> 03:28:41.740]   Now he was saying the left is a bunch of
[03:28:41.740 --> 03:28:42.620]   wussies, right?
[03:28:42.620 --> 03:28:45.980]   So I wrote a blog saying, hey, Michael, I
[03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:47.060]   would rather debate you.
[03:28:47.060 --> 03:28:49.380]   So if you want to debate about how we're
[03:28:49.380 --> 03:28:50.900]   wussies, let's do it.
[03:28:50.900 --> 03:28:51.780]   Let's find a thing.
[03:28:51.780 --> 03:28:54.940]   But you know, you're mentioning physicality,
[03:28:54.940 --> 03:28:55.300]   right?
[03:28:55.300 --> 03:28:56.540]   And how you guys are tougher.
[03:28:56.820 --> 03:28:59.820]   So if you prefer only in a prescribed setting,
[03:28:59.820 --> 03:29:01.500]   right, and we're not going to go do it in
[03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:02.860]   the streets like idiots, right?
[03:29:02.860 --> 03:29:04.980]   But if you want, we'll have a boxing match or
[03:29:04.980 --> 03:29:07.300]   whatever you want and we'll see who's tougher.
[03:29:07.300 --> 03:29:11.780]   And he panicked and he cried to mommy,
[03:29:11.780 --> 03:29:13.300]   which was Ariana Huffington.
[03:29:13.300 --> 03:29:16.060]   And oh, Jake's intimidating me.
[03:29:16.060 --> 03:29:16.300]   Right.
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:16.620]   Okay.
[03:29:16.620 --> 03:29:16.940]   All right.
[03:29:16.940 --> 03:29:18.500]   Well, who's the wussy now, bitch.
[03:29:18.500 --> 03:29:19.220]   Right.
[03:29:19.220 --> 03:29:22.060]   So that is not to actually get into a fight
[03:29:22.060 --> 03:29:24.340]   with poor Michael Smirkonish, right?
[03:29:24.780 --> 03:29:27.420]   It's to prove, hey, don't use rhetoric like that.
[03:29:27.420 --> 03:29:28.380]   That's dumb.
[03:29:28.380 --> 03:29:30.780]   And this is me proving that it's dumb.
[03:29:30.780 --> 03:29:31.660]   Okay.
[03:29:31.660 --> 03:29:34.340]   So now Joe had said, I forget what he said
[03:29:34.340 --> 03:29:36.060]   at the time and he'd said something similar.
[03:29:36.060 --> 03:29:36.580]   Right.
[03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:39.060]   And I'm up to here with Joe at that point.
[03:29:39.060 --> 03:29:40.740]   I don't know if we'll ever talking yet.
[03:29:40.740 --> 03:29:41.140]   Right.
[03:29:41.140 --> 03:29:41.460]   But.
[03:29:41.460 --> 03:29:43.260]   You've been on a show and I really, that
[03:29:43.260 --> 03:29:44.180]   was a good conversation.
[03:29:44.180 --> 03:29:44.980]   It was a great conversation.
[03:29:44.980 --> 03:29:45.620]   It was a while back.
[03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:45.860]   Yeah.
[03:29:45.860 --> 03:29:46.260]   Yeah.
[03:29:46.260 --> 03:29:47.460]   I hope he has you on again.
[03:29:47.460 --> 03:29:47.940]   Yeah.
[03:29:47.940 --> 03:29:49.060]   So I get it.
[03:29:49.060 --> 03:29:52.460]   He, I bet you, I don't like this take you
[03:29:52.460 --> 03:29:54.020]   have a lot.
[03:29:54.060 --> 03:29:57.260]   I bet you, he hates it because him as an
[03:29:57.260 --> 03:30:01.020]   MMA commentator, he gets to hear so many
[03:30:01.020 --> 03:30:04.500]   bros, it's all about the mindset, bro.
[03:30:04.500 --> 03:30:07.700]   Now the steel man, the point you're making,
[03:30:07.700 --> 03:30:09.940]   which I do think it's the stupidest thing
[03:30:09.940 --> 03:30:11.740]   you've ever said, but.
[03:30:11.740 --> 03:30:16.220]   The actual intent, which is whether you're
[03:30:16.220 --> 03:30:18.660]   left or right, there's, there's strong people
[03:30:18.660 --> 03:30:21.860]   on the left, like mentally strong, physically
[03:30:21.860 --> 03:30:25.340]   strong, like, I think the whole point is not
[03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:26.860]   that you can beat them, but you're willing
[03:30:26.860 --> 03:30:29.500]   to step, you're willing to fight if you need
[03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:31.180]   to, that's it's a hundred percent.
[03:30:31.180 --> 03:30:33.100]   So it's not like, I believe I could beat
[03:30:33.100 --> 03:30:33.220]   them.
[03:30:33.220 --> 03:30:35.180]   It's like, I'm willing, like all this shit,
[03:30:35.180 --> 03:30:36.900]   you know, calling the people on the left
[03:30:36.900 --> 03:30:37.940]   wusses or whatever.
[03:30:37.940 --> 03:30:40.620]   I'm willing to step in the fight, even if
[03:30:40.620 --> 03:30:42.900]   I'm on train, even if I'm in shape, I'm
[03:30:42.900 --> 03:30:43.500]   willing to fight.
[03:30:43.500 --> 03:30:44.500]   Yeah, I get it.
[03:30:44.500 --> 03:30:46.220]   I mean, I understand that, but it's just
[03:30:46.220 --> 03:30:47.420]   pick a different person.
[03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:50.940]   Um, that's why I wrote down on my genuine
[03:30:50.940 --> 03:30:53.860]   curiosity is if you can beat up Alex, Alex
[03:30:53.860 --> 03:30:57.140]   Jones versus Cenk, that, that, that, the
[03:30:57.140 --> 03:30:59.100]   legitimacy is I would pay for that because
[03:30:59.100 --> 03:31:00.180]   you're both untrained.
[03:31:00.180 --> 03:31:04.180]   Um, you both got, I would say the spirit.
[03:31:04.180 --> 03:31:07.140]   No, no, he has, look, I'll give the same
[03:31:07.140 --> 03:31:07.940]   fairness.
[03:31:07.940 --> 03:31:08.300]   Yeah.
[03:31:08.300 --> 03:31:10.340]   I think I got an 8% chance of being,
[03:31:10.340 --> 03:31:11.340]   beating Rogan.
[03:31:11.340 --> 03:31:12.740]   Yeah, you're, you're the boss.
[03:31:12.740 --> 03:31:13.820]   I know, I got it, hold on.
[03:31:13.820 --> 03:31:14.300]   All right.
[03:31:14.300 --> 03:31:16.740]   And I think to be fair, Alex has an 8%
[03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:17.540]   chance of beating me.
[03:31:17.540 --> 03:31:18.540]   Oh, wow.
[03:31:18.540 --> 03:31:18.940]   Yeah.
[03:31:18.940 --> 03:31:19.540]   Okay.
[03:31:19.540 --> 03:31:20.980]   Because you never know, he catches
[03:31:20.980 --> 03:31:21.820]   you on a lucky punch.
[03:31:21.820 --> 03:31:24.420]   I got punched in the ear once and you lose
[03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:26.060]   your balance and then you're in a lot of
[03:31:26.060 --> 03:31:26.820]   trouble, right?
[03:31:26.820 --> 03:31:29.660]   So I can get lucky, Alex Jones can't lucky.
[03:31:29.660 --> 03:31:31.660]   It's me against Rogan is harder.
[03:31:31.660 --> 03:31:34.740]   I like you, if you said to me, you don't
[03:31:34.740 --> 03:31:38.780]   have 8% chance, um, but Alex does.
[03:31:38.780 --> 03:31:39.420]   Okay.
[03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:41.260]   I'm not going to, it's, it's fine.
[03:31:41.260 --> 03:31:41.700]   Right.
[03:31:41.700 --> 03:31:44.580]   So why would it, does Alex stand
[03:31:44.580 --> 03:31:45.620]   almost no chance against me?
[03:31:45.620 --> 03:31:47.500]   So first of all, it's not just because
[03:31:47.500 --> 03:31:48.660]   I'm big and he's big.
[03:31:48.820 --> 03:31:49.900]   One, I wrestled.
[03:31:49.900 --> 03:31:50.740]   Oh, you wrestled.
[03:31:50.740 --> 03:31:51.180]   Yeah.
[03:31:51.180 --> 03:31:54.020]   If you wrestled, then you're like, I watched
[03:31:54.020 --> 03:31:56.100]   this show with my kids, Physical 100, it's
[03:31:56.100 --> 03:31:58.020]   like a Korean show where they try to find
[03:31:58.020 --> 03:31:59.420]   out who's the best, best athlete.
[03:31:59.420 --> 03:32:00.780]   They have one thing where they have to
[03:32:00.780 --> 03:32:02.660]   wrestle away the ball and keep it, this
[03:32:02.660 --> 03:32:03.420]   big giant ball.
[03:32:03.420 --> 03:32:05.260]   I'm like, every wrestler is going to win.
[03:32:05.260 --> 03:32:06.900]   Every MMA fighter is going to win.
[03:32:06.900 --> 03:32:08.140]   And every time they win.
[03:32:08.140 --> 03:32:09.340]   And they're like, dad, how'd you know that?
[03:32:09.340 --> 03:32:10.900]   Because we get trained.
[03:32:10.900 --> 03:32:13.220]   We're not going to lose to a non-wrestler
[03:32:13.220 --> 03:32:14.660]   in a wrestling contest.
[03:32:14.660 --> 03:32:15.540]   It's not going to happen.
[03:32:15.540 --> 03:32:15.980]   Right.
[03:32:16.300 --> 03:32:18.900]   So you can get lucky, but it's unlikely.
[03:32:18.900 --> 03:32:22.220]   So one wrestling, now that was from a long
[03:32:22.220 --> 03:32:23.860]   time ago, but at least, you know, the mechanics.
[03:32:23.860 --> 03:32:24.260]   Right.
[03:32:24.260 --> 03:32:27.260]   Uh, number two, I've gotten into about 30
[03:32:27.260 --> 03:32:28.780]   actual street fights in my life.
[03:32:28.780 --> 03:32:30.380]   And you can say street fights, not the same
[03:32:30.380 --> 03:32:31.540]   as MMA, of course that's true.
[03:32:31.540 --> 03:32:32.220]   Obviously true.
[03:32:32.220 --> 03:32:32.580]   Right.
[03:32:32.580 --> 03:32:34.260]   But it's not no experience.
[03:32:34.260 --> 03:32:35.380]   It's some experience.
[03:32:35.380 --> 03:32:37.620]   And the most important part of a street
[03:32:37.620 --> 03:32:40.420]   fight is being able to take a punch to the face.
[03:32:40.420 --> 03:32:41.180]   Okay.
[03:32:41.180 --> 03:32:41.340]   Yeah.
[03:32:41.340 --> 03:32:43.260]   Knowing what it feels like to get punched in the face.
[03:32:43.260 --> 03:32:43.660]   Yeah.
[03:32:43.660 --> 03:32:45.180]   So I've been punched in the face.
[03:32:45.220 --> 03:32:47.060]   I don't know, dozens of times in my life.
[03:32:47.060 --> 03:32:49.380]   I used to start fights by saying, I'll
[03:32:49.380 --> 03:32:50.580]   let you take the first punch.
[03:32:50.580 --> 03:32:51.500]   Okay.
[03:32:51.500 --> 03:32:54.460]   So I didn't start the fights.
[03:32:54.460 --> 03:32:55.580]   They just started cause they'd
[03:32:55.580 --> 03:32:56.460]   punch me in the face.
[03:32:56.460 --> 03:32:57.060]   Okay.
[03:32:57.060 --> 03:33:00.980]   So, and then, and then for Alex, the main
[03:33:00.980 --> 03:33:04.020]   thing, and also true for Rogan is it's
[03:33:04.020 --> 03:33:05.420]   about willpower, right?
[03:33:05.420 --> 03:33:11.220]   So if you, if, if Joe has a 92% chance, in
[03:33:11.220 --> 03:33:13.300]   my opinion, of knocking me out or beating me,
[03:33:13.300 --> 03:33:15.820]   because he has the skill and he's trained
[03:33:15.820 --> 03:33:17.020]   and he knows what he's doing.
[03:33:17.020 --> 03:33:18.620]   So all the willpower in the world, isn't
[03:33:18.620 --> 03:33:20.260]   going to help you if you get kicked
[03:33:20.260 --> 03:33:21.380]   upside the head, right?
[03:33:21.380 --> 03:33:25.180]   So, but in the unlikely circumstances
[03:33:25.180 --> 03:33:27.060]   that I've worn him down, right.
[03:33:27.060 --> 03:33:28.900]   Then I'm a little bit more in the ball
[03:33:28.900 --> 03:33:30.740]   game because I got willpower for Alex.
[03:33:30.740 --> 03:33:32.580]   He doesn't have the willpower I have.
[03:33:32.580 --> 03:33:33.300]   Okay.
[03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:36.020]   I'm because to me, the idea of losing
[03:33:36.020 --> 03:33:38.980]   Alex Jones is unthinkable.
[03:33:38.980 --> 03:33:42.380]   I would do anything not to lose anything.
[03:33:42.500 --> 03:33:44.100]   Let me just say, so that's beautiful.
[03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:44.580]   I love this.
[03:33:44.580 --> 03:33:46.620]   I would pay a lot of money to watch the
[03:33:46.620 --> 03:33:48.140]   two of you just even like wrestle.
[03:33:48.140 --> 03:33:53.620]   But with Joe, I think, I just, I have to
[03:33:53.620 --> 03:33:57.940]   say it's like, it's, it's 0.0001% chance.
[03:33:57.940 --> 03:33:59.820]   You have a chance before you even get to
[03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:00.540]   the mentality.
[03:34:00.540 --> 03:34:04.300]   And the other thing is on the mentality
[03:34:04.300 --> 03:34:06.620]   side, one of the fascinating things about
[03:34:06.620 --> 03:34:09.420]   Joe is he's actually a sweetheart in person
[03:34:09.420 --> 03:34:12.020]   like this, but there's something that takes
[03:34:12.020 --> 03:34:13.580]   over him when he competes.
[03:34:13.580 --> 03:34:16.220]   Brother, we've been around 22 years in the
[03:34:16.220 --> 03:34:17.820]   toughest industry in the world.
[03:34:17.820 --> 03:34:18.260]   I understand, yeah.
[03:34:18.260 --> 03:34:18.780]   Right.
[03:34:18.780 --> 03:34:21.060]   If you, like, do you have any idea how
[03:34:21.060 --> 03:34:23.900]   hard it is to run a 75 person company and
[03:34:23.900 --> 03:34:26.420]   make money online and survive after all the
[03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:27.980]   guys who took billions of dollars went.
[03:34:27.980 --> 03:34:28.500]   I hear you.
[03:34:28.500 --> 03:34:29.660]   Tremendous willpower.
[03:34:29.660 --> 03:34:32.620]   So, but overall you're, I, this is
[03:34:32.620 --> 03:34:33.780]   not the hill I'm dying on.
[03:34:33.780 --> 03:34:33.940]   Right.
[03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:34.460]   Okay.
[03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:36.900]   Joe would win, I get it.
[03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:41.420]   I think we're all allowed one kind of, um,
[03:34:41.500 --> 03:34:42.940]   blind spot, I suppose.
[03:34:42.940 --> 03:34:47.020]   So you don't think a huge, a big guy that
[03:34:47.020 --> 03:34:49.860]   still is in good shape that was a wrestler
[03:34:49.860 --> 03:34:51.740]   that's been in a lot of street fights,
[03:34:51.740 --> 03:34:53.780]   you still think 0.0001?
[03:34:53.780 --> 03:34:56.460]   It depends on street fights, but yeah, 0.001.
[03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:57.140]   I just see technique.
[03:34:57.140 --> 03:34:58.580]   Okay, yeah, and it's such a minute
[03:34:58.580 --> 03:35:01.260]   disagreement because, so take me out of it.
[03:35:01.260 --> 03:35:02.900]   So you take out the willpower part of blah,
[03:35:02.900 --> 03:35:03.220]   blah, blah.
[03:35:03.220 --> 03:35:03.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:35:03.580 --> 03:35:05.060]   I think it's one to 2%.
[03:35:05.060 --> 03:35:06.460]   Yeah, he could catch the guy on about,
[03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:08.060]   you know, and get lucky.
[03:35:08.060 --> 03:35:09.620]   I think it's because I've talked to, so I
[03:35:09.620 --> 03:35:11.780]   trained with a coach named John Donaher and
[03:35:11.780 --> 03:35:13.660]   we talk about this a lot and I think
[03:35:13.660 --> 03:35:17.580]   technique is just such, technique is the
[03:35:17.580 --> 03:35:19.340]   thing that also feeds the willpower.
[03:35:19.340 --> 03:35:21.060]   It actually builds up your confidence in
[03:35:21.060 --> 03:35:24.140]   the, in the way that like nothing else
[03:35:24.140 --> 03:35:27.900]   does, in the, in the more actionable way,
[03:35:27.900 --> 03:35:30.900]   because you won't need that much willpower.
[03:35:30.900 --> 03:35:32.020]   No, I totally get that.
[03:35:32.020 --> 03:35:34.300]   If the technique is back, like you don't
[03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:36.940]   have to be like a tough guy to win debates
[03:35:36.940 --> 03:35:39.300]   if you're just fucking good at debates.
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:39.620]   Right.
[03:35:39.620 --> 03:35:41.900]   So I think people just don't understand
[03:35:41.900 --> 03:35:44.260]   the value in sport and especially
[03:35:44.260 --> 03:35:46.220]   in combat of technique.
[03:35:46.220 --> 03:35:48.900]   No, I, the, a great irony here is I
[03:35:48.900 --> 03:35:50.140]   actually totally agree with that.
[03:35:50.140 --> 03:35:52.620]   That's why I mentioned the physical 100,
[03:35:52.620 --> 03:35:53.820]   technique's going to win every day,
[03:35:53.820 --> 03:35:55.220]   like almost every time.
[03:35:55.220 --> 03:35:56.740]   We're having a debate about whether
[03:35:56.740 --> 03:35:59.260]   it's eight or one or 0.01, right?
[03:35:59.260 --> 03:36:01.740]   Like it's either way, technique wins.
[03:36:01.740 --> 03:36:01.940]   Yeah.
[03:36:01.940 --> 03:36:02.460]   We agree.
[03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:02.900]   Okay.
[03:36:02.900 --> 03:36:03.460]   Beautiful.
[03:36:03.460 --> 03:36:06.620]   In the, uh, one of the controversial
[03:36:06.620 --> 03:36:09.620]   things you've done in the nineties
[03:36:09.620 --> 03:36:12.300]   as a student at UPenn, you publicly
[03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:15.780]   denied the Armenian genocide, which
[03:36:15.780 --> 03:36:18.020]   is the mass murder of over a million
[03:36:18.020 --> 03:36:21.180]   Armenians in 1915 and 16 in the Ottoman
[03:36:21.180 --> 03:36:25.380]   empire, um, you have since then publicly,
[03:36:25.380 --> 03:36:28.220]   uh, and clearly changed your mind on this.
[03:36:28.220 --> 03:36:31.580]   Um, tell me the process you went
[03:36:31.580 --> 03:36:32.420]   through to change your mind.
[03:36:33.860 --> 03:36:34.260]   Yeah.
[03:36:34.260 --> 03:36:37.340]   So when you're a kid, you're taught
[03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:38.140]   a whole bunch of things.
[03:36:38.140 --> 03:36:39.140]   That's the software that we
[03:36:39.140 --> 03:36:40.300]   talked about earlier, right?
[03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:43.180]   So cultural software is media, family,
[03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:45.700]   friends, uh, social media, et cetera.
[03:36:45.700 --> 03:36:50.100]   And so growing up in any tribe, whether
[03:36:50.100 --> 03:36:52.220]   it's a religious tribe or an ethnic tribe,
[03:36:52.220 --> 03:36:54.140]   you're going to get indoctrinated into
[03:36:54.140 --> 03:36:55.380]   that tribes way of thinking.
[03:36:55.380 --> 03:36:58.300]   So you take a Turkish person who's super
[03:36:58.300 --> 03:37:00.940]   progressive, loves Bernie, believes with
[03:37:00.940 --> 03:37:03.420]   all their heart and peace, and you tell
[03:37:03.420 --> 03:37:06.260]   them something about Kurds and they'll
[03:37:06.260 --> 03:37:07.420]   say, Oh no, not those guys.
[03:37:07.420 --> 03:37:08.420]   They're terrible and evil.
[03:37:08.420 --> 03:37:09.620]   And we have to do what we do to them.
[03:37:09.620 --> 03:37:12.380]   Uh, you see, that's the tribe taking over.
[03:37:12.380 --> 03:37:12.820]   Right.
[03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:17.340]   And so, uh, you tell any religious
[03:37:17.340 --> 03:37:18.500]   person what's wrong with the other
[03:37:18.500 --> 03:37:19.740]   religions, they're like, oh yeah, yeah.
[03:37:19.740 --> 03:37:20.420]   That's totally true.
[03:37:20.420 --> 03:37:22.100]   You get to their religion, tribe takes
[03:37:22.100 --> 03:37:24.020]   over, no, how dare you, I'm offended.
[03:37:24.020 --> 03:37:24.340]   Right.
[03:37:24.340 --> 03:37:26.940]   So I grew up with Turkish propaganda.
[03:37:26.940 --> 03:37:28.700]   So, uh, I'll tell you a couple of
[03:37:28.700 --> 03:37:29.620]   funny instances of it.
[03:37:29.620 --> 03:37:31.340]   When we were kids, we'd go to Turkish
[03:37:31.340 --> 03:37:33.740]   American Day Parade, I'm like 10 or 12
[03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:35.420]   years old, it's in the middle of New York.
[03:37:35.420 --> 03:37:37.460]   Cause I grew up in Jersey.
[03:37:37.460 --> 03:37:39.020]   That's why I got in all those fights.
[03:37:39.020 --> 03:37:44.220]   Uh, and, uh, and we would chant in Turkish,
[03:37:44.220 --> 03:37:46.020]   Turkey is the biggest country.
[03:37:46.020 --> 03:37:48.020]   There's no other country that's even big.
[03:37:48.020 --> 03:37:50.060]   And I was like, this is crazy.
[03:37:50.060 --> 03:37:51.540]   I'm like, dad, isn't this crazy?
[03:37:51.540 --> 03:37:53.420]   America's big, China's big.
[03:37:53.420 --> 03:37:55.300]   Why are we chanting this nonsensical chant?
[03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:55.700]   Right.
[03:37:55.700 --> 03:37:57.180]   So that's the beginning of being
[03:37:57.180 --> 03:37:58.260]   to realize you're indoctrinated.
[03:37:58.340 --> 03:38:01.820]   I'm in college and I read about some battle
[03:38:01.820 --> 03:38:04.260]   that the Ottoman Empire lost.
[03:38:04.260 --> 03:38:05.460]   And I'm like, that can't be right.
[03:38:05.460 --> 03:38:07.860]   Uh, the Turks have only lost one war,
[03:38:07.860 --> 03:38:08.820]   World War I, right.
[03:38:08.820 --> 03:38:10.700]   And I was like, oh my God, I'm an idiot.
[03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:12.780]   I got taught that in third grade in Turkey.
[03:38:12.780 --> 03:38:13.980]   Of course, that's not true.
[03:38:13.980 --> 03:38:15.700]   That's ridiculously untrue.
[03:38:15.700 --> 03:38:16.140]   Right.
[03:38:16.140 --> 03:38:18.540]   All those thoughts are in your head.
[03:38:18.540 --> 03:38:19.580]   You don't even realize it.
[03:38:19.580 --> 03:38:22.060]   And so on the Armenian genocide, I read
[03:38:22.060 --> 03:38:24.500]   the Turkish version and the Turkish version
[03:38:24.500 --> 03:38:26.980]   has all of these, this evidence, right?
[03:38:27.220 --> 03:38:29.900]   So it's real in that it exists, but here
[03:38:29.900 --> 03:38:31.180]   I'll give you a great example of it.
[03:38:31.180 --> 03:38:33.820]   Uh, I think it was Colonel Chestery,
[03:38:33.820 --> 03:38:36.420]   some random American, uh, military
[03:38:36.420 --> 03:38:37.980]   guy after World War I.
[03:38:37.980 --> 03:38:40.540]   And he says about the Armenians after
[03:38:40.540 --> 03:38:45.100]   the mass, uh, march, the forced marches.
[03:38:45.100 --> 03:38:47.340]   He says they returned to the area fat
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:48.900]   and entirely unmassacred.
[03:38:48.900 --> 03:38:50.540]   Okay.
[03:38:50.540 --> 03:38:51.780]   I'm like, Hey, that's an American
[03:38:51.780 --> 03:38:52.900]   Colonel that's saying that.
[03:38:52.900 --> 03:38:54.220]   So that's obviously true.
[03:38:54.220 --> 03:38:55.940]   You see, they didn't happen, right.
[03:38:55.940 --> 03:38:57.540]   Or at least in the way that the Armenians say.
[03:38:57.540 --> 03:38:59.980]   Now as a grownup, I look at it and I go,
[03:38:59.980 --> 03:39:00.580]   are you kidding me?
[03:39:00.580 --> 03:39:02.260]   That guy's obviously trying to get a contract
[03:39:02.260 --> 03:39:03.460]   with the Turkish government, right?
[03:39:03.460 --> 03:39:06.700]   Nobody returns from a forced march fat
[03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:09.220]   and entirely unmassacred, right?
[03:39:09.220 --> 03:39:10.620]   So that's propaganda.
[03:39:10.620 --> 03:39:16.660]   And so it, and that one was so indoctrinated
[03:39:16.660 --> 03:39:18.300]   that it was tough to let go.
[03:39:18.300 --> 03:39:21.460]   So in, at Penn, I write that op-ed,
[03:39:21.460 --> 03:39:24.260]   et cetera, and then over the course of time.
[03:39:24.260 --> 03:39:26.540]   And so Anna and I disagree on things from
[03:39:26.540 --> 03:39:28.700]   time to time, and we've been co-hosting now
[03:39:28.700 --> 03:39:31.660]   for, she's been at Young Turks for 18 years
[03:39:31.660 --> 03:39:34.140]   and co-hosting for, you know, almost 18.
[03:39:34.140 --> 03:39:37.380]   And so she's Armenian.
[03:39:37.380 --> 03:39:39.100]   And by the way, I love America.
[03:39:39.100 --> 03:39:40.620]   I mean, look, we came to America because
[03:39:40.620 --> 03:39:42.140]   we love this country, land of hope and
[03:39:42.140 --> 03:39:43.820]   opportunity, that's part of why I fight
[03:39:43.820 --> 03:39:45.140]   so hard for the average American,
[03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:46.060]   for the American idea.
[03:39:46.060 --> 03:39:48.540]   So here's a Turk and an Armenian doing
[03:39:48.540 --> 03:39:50.460]   a show together and it becomes the number
[03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:51.620]   one online news show.
[03:39:51.620 --> 03:39:53.740]   That's the beauty of America, right?
[03:39:54.140 --> 03:39:57.380]   So she's telling me things and we're
[03:39:57.380 --> 03:40:00.180]   having some on-air discussions about it,
[03:40:00.180 --> 03:40:02.900]   et cetera, and then it just dawned on me,
[03:40:02.900 --> 03:40:06.460]   like, no, this was, this too was obviously
[03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:07.140]   propaganda.
[03:40:07.140 --> 03:40:10.220]   So at that point, once you realize that it
[03:40:10.220 --> 03:40:11.620]   becomes easier, that's why I'm trying to
[03:40:11.620 --> 03:40:14.300]   unplug people from the matrix, because once
[03:40:14.300 --> 03:40:16.300]   you realize it's propaganda, oh my God,
[03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:18.380]   it gets infinitely easier to start telling
[03:40:18.380 --> 03:40:19.300]   what's true or not true.
[03:40:19.300 --> 03:40:22.860]   So maybe by way of advice, how do you know
[03:40:22.860 --> 03:40:24.580]   when you're diluted by propaganda?
[03:40:24.580 --> 03:40:26.380]   How do you know you're not believing a
[03:40:26.380 --> 03:40:28.780]   kind of, uh, how do you know when you're
[03:40:28.780 --> 03:40:30.380]   not plugged into the matrix, when you're
[03:40:30.380 --> 03:40:31.460]   plugged into the matrix?
[03:40:31.460 --> 03:40:33.460]   You have to keep testing it against
[03:40:33.460 --> 03:40:34.460]   objective reality.
[03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:35.420]   Okay.
[03:40:35.420 --> 03:40:37.580]   They said something, did it happen or
[03:40:37.580 --> 03:40:38.500]   did it not happen?
[03:40:38.500 --> 03:40:40.420]   So here, here's an easy one.
[03:40:40.420 --> 03:40:43.420]   Alex Jones, for a long time, especially
[03:40:43.420 --> 03:40:45.460]   under Obama, kept saying, they're going to
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:46.660]   put us on FIBA caps.
[03:40:46.660 --> 03:40:47.820]   I'm telling you, they're going to stuff
[03:40:47.820 --> 03:40:49.180]   us all in the FIBA caps and they're going
[03:40:49.180 --> 03:40:50.900]   to put us in and they're going to let us out.
[03:40:50.900 --> 03:40:51.540]   I know it.
[03:40:51.540 --> 03:40:52.380]   I know it for sure.
[03:40:52.380 --> 03:40:52.660]   Right.
[03:40:53.060 --> 03:40:55.700]   Nobody's been in a FIBA cap, Obama left.
[03:40:55.700 --> 03:40:56.700]   There was no FIBA caps.
[03:40:56.700 --> 03:40:58.740]   So what I asked like for the right wing
[03:40:58.740 --> 03:41:01.540]   conspiracy guys, guys, has any of their
[03:41:01.540 --> 03:41:02.740]   things ever come true?
[03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:05.620]   Like they always say all these crazy things
[03:41:05.620 --> 03:41:07.020]   that never, ever happened.
[03:41:07.020 --> 03:41:10.500]   So the third time it doesn't happen, can
[03:41:10.500 --> 03:41:13.060]   you please start to wonder, maybe I'm on
[03:41:13.060 --> 03:41:14.580]   the wrong side, maybe.
[03:41:14.580 --> 03:41:16.860]   And, but, but that's not just for right
[03:41:16.860 --> 03:41:17.820]   wingers, that's easy.
[03:41:17.820 --> 03:41:18.420]   Right.
[03:41:18.420 --> 03:41:20.540]   But it's also for mainstream media.
[03:41:20.540 --> 03:41:21.900]   And that's where I get the biggest
[03:41:21.900 --> 03:41:24.540]   pushback and that's where, because my
[03:41:24.540 --> 03:41:28.260]   tribe is, is what the kids call PMC,
[03:41:28.260 --> 03:41:29.620]   professional management class.
[03:41:29.620 --> 03:41:30.460]   Okay.
[03:41:30.460 --> 03:41:34.060]   They're curious, you go up the ladder,
[03:41:34.060 --> 03:41:36.300]   you have this route, that route, et cetera.
[03:41:36.300 --> 03:41:40.180]   And so for that class, the status
[03:41:40.180 --> 03:41:41.420]   quo is pretty good.
[03:41:41.420 --> 03:41:43.780]   So when you get, when Biden gives you
[03:41:43.780 --> 03:41:46.140]   15% change, you're like, what else do
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:46.980]   y'all want?
[03:41:46.980 --> 03:41:48.300]   That's amazing.
[03:41:48.300 --> 03:41:49.980]   He just course corrected a little bit.
[03:41:49.980 --> 03:41:50.860]   Now it's perfect.
[03:41:50.860 --> 03:41:51.220]   Right.
[03:41:51.660 --> 03:41:53.500]   But for the average guy who needs
[03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:56.060]   a hundred percent change, not 15, they
[03:41:56.060 --> 03:41:59.180]   look at it and they go, what the fuck?
[03:41:59.180 --> 03:42:00.860]   He only did 15% and everybody's
[03:42:00.860 --> 03:42:02.220]   declaring him a hero, right?
[03:42:02.220 --> 03:42:04.100]   So those are the hardest guys to get
[03:42:04.100 --> 03:42:05.340]   through on, and those are the guys who
[03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:07.260]   get most mad at me, not the right wingers,
[03:42:07.260 --> 03:42:08.140]   the establishment.
[03:42:08.140 --> 03:42:11.140]   That's why I, I'm nails on a chalkboard
[03:42:11.140 --> 03:42:14.100]   for them because I'm on the left, but I
[03:42:14.100 --> 03:42:17.380]   call out their crap and their marketing
[03:42:17.380 --> 03:42:20.500]   and propaganda, and that's why I mentioned
[03:42:20.500 --> 03:42:23.980]   earlier, no one probably, he might not
[03:42:23.980 --> 03:42:25.980]   even consciously know it, but no one
[03:42:25.980 --> 03:42:27.740]   dislikes Bernie more than Obama, because
[03:42:27.740 --> 03:42:30.540]   if Bernie got into office, he'd embarrass
[03:42:30.540 --> 03:42:32.900]   Obama by doing a lot more change.
[03:42:32.900 --> 03:42:35.620]   And Obama told us the change wasn't
[03:42:35.620 --> 03:42:37.580]   possible, you could only get 5%.
[03:42:37.580 --> 03:42:40.140]   And so if Bernie does 50%, then
[03:42:40.140 --> 03:42:42.340]   Obama's humiliated and his record
[03:42:42.340 --> 03:42:43.620]   and his legacy is ruined.
[03:42:43.620 --> 03:42:44.420]   Right?
[03:42:44.420 --> 03:42:46.700]   So he, I don't think he makes that
[03:42:46.700 --> 03:42:48.060]   conscious decision, right?
[03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:49.300]   But it's subconscious.
[03:42:49.300 --> 03:42:50.300]   It's a way of thinking.
[03:42:50.620 --> 03:42:55.420]   So if you're watching morning, Joe test
[03:42:55.420 --> 03:42:58.020]   them, he says something that Biden
[03:42:58.020 --> 03:42:59.820]   is for $15 minimum wage.
[03:42:59.820 --> 03:43:01.780]   When Biden takes it out of the bill,
[03:43:01.780 --> 03:43:04.460]   know that morning, Joe was lying to you.
[03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:06.620]   He says that Biden said he was for the
[03:43:06.620 --> 03:43:08.740]   public option, but he never even proposed
[03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:11.100]   it when morning, Joe still defends them.
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:13.500]   And, and you see an objective reality.
[03:43:13.500 --> 03:43:15.620]   Biden didn't actually propose that bill.
[03:43:15.620 --> 03:43:17.500]   You know, that they're lying to you
[03:43:17.500 --> 03:43:19.900]   tested against objective reality.
[03:43:19.900 --> 03:43:21.460]   Did it actually happen or didn't it?
[03:43:21.460 --> 03:43:23.580]   I mean, there's some of that, just to
[03:43:23.580 --> 03:43:25.460]   steal me on some of the conspiracy theories.
[03:43:25.460 --> 03:43:28.580]   Do you think there's some value to the
[03:43:28.580 --> 03:43:31.060]   conspiracy theories, uh, that come from
[03:43:31.060 --> 03:43:32.980]   the right, but actually more so come
[03:43:32.980 --> 03:43:34.300]   from the anti-establishment?
[03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:36.500]   So, I mean, for me, one, I mean, there's
[03:43:36.500 --> 03:43:40.980]   a lot that, uh, raise a bit of a question.
[03:43:40.980 --> 03:43:43.420]   Um, a lot of them could probably be
[03:43:43.420 --> 03:43:45.220]   explained by corporatism and the
[03:43:45.220 --> 03:43:46.660]   military industrial complex.
[03:43:46.660 --> 03:43:49.020]   Uh, but there's also a lot of them
[03:43:49.020 --> 03:43:51.140]   can be explained by creepiness and
[03:43:51.140 --> 03:43:52.820]   shadiness in human nature.
[03:43:52.820 --> 03:43:55.540]   Uh, Epstein is an example of that.
[03:43:55.540 --> 03:43:57.260]   There's a lot of ways to explain Epstein,
[03:43:57.260 --> 03:44:01.500]   um, including the basic creepiness of
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:04.660]   human nature, um, but there could be
[03:44:04.660 --> 03:44:06.260]   bigger explanations underlying it.
[03:44:06.260 --> 03:44:09.660]   So sometimes when we have long, uh,
[03:44:09.660 --> 03:44:11.620]   thoughtful conversations like this, I'll
[03:44:11.620 --> 03:44:13.860]   say it depends a lot and then people
[03:44:13.860 --> 03:44:15.500]   get frustrated by that, but then you're
[03:44:15.500 --> 03:44:18.180]   frustrated by the world because it depends.
[03:44:18.540 --> 03:44:22.060]   So conspiracy theories, if you say, are
[03:44:22.060 --> 03:44:23.820]   they all right, or are they all wrong?
[03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:25.460]   Already the question's wrong.
[03:44:25.460 --> 03:44:27.660]   So it depends.
[03:44:27.660 --> 03:44:29.300]   What is the conspiracy theory?
[03:44:29.300 --> 03:44:31.940]   So if it's, you know, some of the absurd
[03:44:31.940 --> 03:44:33.780]   ones we've mentioned here, that's
[03:44:33.780 --> 03:44:35.340]   easily disproven, right?
[03:44:35.340 --> 03:44:39.220]   Um, on the other hand, um, there's a
[03:44:39.220 --> 03:44:42.020]   conspiracy theory, uh, about JFK's
[03:44:42.020 --> 03:44:45.180]   assassination, which one's the conspiracy
[03:44:45.180 --> 03:44:47.900]   theory that Lee Harvey Oswald from like
[03:44:48.020 --> 03:44:50.060]   12 miles away, shot a magic bullet that
[03:44:50.060 --> 03:44:52.580]   went like this and hit like 13 people and
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:55.700]   came out, uh, Kennedy's brain, or that the
[03:44:55.700 --> 03:44:58.100]   government might've wanted to cover up an
[03:44:58.100 --> 03:44:59.900]   assassination of the president for whatever
[03:44:59.900 --> 03:45:00.380]   reason.
[03:45:00.380 --> 03:45:01.500]   Okay.
[03:45:01.500 --> 03:45:02.980]   Come on.
[03:45:02.980 --> 03:45:05.300]   Now I'm of course doing hyperbole and like
[03:45:05.300 --> 03:45:07.380]   the JFK enthusiasts will be like, no, it
[03:45:07.380 --> 03:45:08.900]   did, the bullet didn't actually go like this.
[03:45:08.900 --> 03:45:10.180]   It didn't actually hit 13 people.
[03:45:10.180 --> 03:45:11.980]   I'm, I'm, I'm kidding guys.
[03:45:11.980 --> 03:45:12.420]   Okay.
[03:45:12.420 --> 03:45:15.900]   But in terms of, is that conspiracy theory
[03:45:15.900 --> 03:45:18.260]   real, that JFK was not just killed by Lee
[03:45:18.260 --> 03:45:19.060]   Harvey Oswald?
[03:45:19.060 --> 03:45:20.500]   Almost certainly.
[03:45:20.500 --> 03:45:21.300]   Right.
[03:45:21.300 --> 03:45:25.740]   Uh, and so if you read real books with tons
[03:45:25.740 --> 03:45:28.660]   of information, the most likely culprit is
[03:45:28.660 --> 03:45:31.220]   Alan Dulles, the head of the CIA that he
[03:45:31.220 --> 03:45:34.460]   fired back when there was a deep state, there
[03:45:34.460 --> 03:45:35.820]   actually was a deep state.
[03:45:35.820 --> 03:45:39.300]   They did coups against other country's
[03:45:39.300 --> 03:45:41.580]   leaders all the time, but they tell us, oh,
[03:45:41.580 --> 03:45:43.420]   they wouldn't do it to our own leader.
[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:45.740]   But remember, it's not the CIA.
[03:45:45.740 --> 03:45:46.940]   He'd left the CIA already.
[03:45:46.940 --> 03:45:47.340]   Right.
[03:45:47.340 --> 03:45:49.700]   So he get, you know, so I don't know if it
[03:45:49.700 --> 03:45:51.300]   was ex CIA guys.
[03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:52.980]   I don't know if the mob was involved.
[03:45:52.980 --> 03:45:54.980]   I don't know any of those details, but I
[03:45:54.980 --> 03:45:57.060]   know some things that are obvious.
[03:45:57.060 --> 03:45:59.060]   That bullet didn't magically hit him from
[03:45:59.060 --> 03:46:02.660]   over there as Jack Ruby killed Lee Harvey
[03:46:02.660 --> 03:46:05.820]   Oswald, Jack Ruby was a mobster who on the
[03:46:05.820 --> 03:46:08.140]   record had said that he hated Kennedy.
[03:46:08.140 --> 03:46:09.860]   All of a sudden he became patriotic
[03:46:09.860 --> 03:46:12.580]   overnight and shot the assailant who was
[03:46:12.580 --> 03:46:15.420]   unguarded, maybe less likely.
[03:46:15.700 --> 03:46:16.020]   Okay.
[03:46:16.020 --> 03:46:17.180]   So let's speed up though.
[03:46:17.180 --> 03:46:19.780]   So my point is, yeah, some conspiracy
[03:46:19.780 --> 03:46:20.980]   theories could be true.
[03:46:20.980 --> 03:46:22.940]   It depends on objective reality, right?
[03:46:22.940 --> 03:46:24.260]   You get to Epstein.
[03:46:24.260 --> 03:46:30.300]   Again, I always do it ahead of time because
[03:46:30.300 --> 03:46:32.420]   I want you to test me and see, does it
[03:46:32.420 --> 03:46:33.660]   match objective reality?
[03:46:33.660 --> 03:46:37.420]   So I said the minute that it happened,
[03:46:37.420 --> 03:46:39.460]   you'll have your answer based on whether
[03:46:39.460 --> 03:46:41.140]   the video in the hallway worked or not.
[03:46:41.140 --> 03:46:43.820]   If the video in the hallway works, there'll
[03:46:43.820 --> 03:46:46.540]   be just as many conspiracy theories, but
[03:46:46.540 --> 03:46:48.340]   it'll show actually who went in and didn't
[03:46:48.340 --> 03:46:48.620]   go in.
[03:46:48.620 --> 03:46:49.380]   Okay.
[03:46:49.380 --> 03:46:51.580]   But if the video in the hallway doesn't
[03:46:51.580 --> 03:46:52.980]   work, they definitely killed him.
[03:46:52.980 --> 03:46:54.100]   Okay.
[03:46:54.100 --> 03:46:58.020]   So a couple of days later, Oh, the video
[03:46:58.020 --> 03:47:00.460]   in that particular hallway happened to not
[03:47:00.460 --> 03:47:03.180]   be working and the guards both happened to
[03:47:03.180 --> 03:47:05.260]   be on break at the same time.
[03:47:05.260 --> 03:47:08.580]   And the most notorious pedophile criminal
[03:47:08.580 --> 03:47:10.940]   in the country happened to be unguarded.
[03:47:11.260 --> 03:47:14.620]   And that is the one time he decided
[03:47:14.620 --> 03:47:15.580]   to hang himself.
[03:47:15.580 --> 03:47:18.580]   Listen, man, the only way you believe that
[03:47:18.580 --> 03:47:21.860]   is if you got mainstream media to get you
[03:47:21.860 --> 03:47:24.820]   to believe that the word, that the minute
[03:47:24.820 --> 03:47:27.660]   the phrase conspiracy theory is mentioned,
[03:47:27.660 --> 03:47:30.140]   you have to shut off your mind and you have
[03:47:30.140 --> 03:47:31.580]   to believe whatever the media tells you.
[03:47:31.580 --> 03:47:32.380]   Yeah.
[03:47:32.380 --> 03:47:34.220]   Well, it's interesting you just mentioned,
[03:47:34.220 --> 03:47:36.660]   do you think the CIA has not grown in power
[03:47:36.660 --> 03:47:37.300]   versus?
[03:47:37.300 --> 03:47:39.580]   No, no, they've greatly waned in power.
[03:47:39.580 --> 03:47:40.620]   Interesting.
[03:47:40.660 --> 03:47:43.140]   So, so in the old days, the CIA has an
[03:47:43.140 --> 03:47:45.500]   actual deep state and because the country
[03:47:45.500 --> 03:47:48.580]   was run by a bunch of families, right?
[03:47:48.580 --> 03:47:50.580]   So you go to Yale, the skull and bones
[03:47:50.580 --> 03:47:51.860]   thing was real, right?
[03:47:51.860 --> 03:47:54.140]   And you go to Harvard, you go to this and
[03:47:54.140 --> 03:47:55.940]   half the, look at the Dulles family, right?
[03:47:55.940 --> 03:47:57.660]   Half of them go into government, the other
[03:47:57.660 --> 03:47:58.700]   half go into banking.
[03:47:58.700 --> 03:48:01.820]   Uh, why are the Central American countries
[03:48:01.820 --> 03:48:02.980]   called banana republics?
[03:48:02.980 --> 03:48:06.340]   Because we weed America, did a coup
[03:48:06.340 --> 03:48:09.140]   against one of those countries because
[03:48:09.140 --> 03:48:10.420]   a banana company wanted it.
[03:48:10.740 --> 03:48:11.240]   Okay.
[03:48:11.240 --> 03:48:13.180]   The, cause they're like, how dare you
[03:48:13.180 --> 03:48:14.980]   charge whatever you want for your natural
[03:48:14.980 --> 03:48:17.700]   resource, we American corporations have
[03:48:17.700 --> 03:48:19.540]   the right to all of your natural resources
[03:48:19.540 --> 03:48:21.060]   at the lowest possible rate.
[03:48:21.060 --> 03:48:22.700]   Alan, get rid of these guys.
[03:48:22.700 --> 03:48:23.420]   Okay.
[03:48:23.420 --> 03:48:24.820]   And, and Alan would.
[03:48:24.820 --> 03:48:29.580]   And so, and sometimes they would go extra
[03:48:29.580 --> 03:48:30.740]   judicial, right?
[03:48:30.740 --> 03:48:33.740]   Like potentially with the JFK assassination.
[03:48:33.740 --> 03:48:37.260]   So now, and, and by the way, you pissed
[03:48:37.260 --> 03:48:40.340]   off J Edgar Hoover, he was just going
[03:48:40.340 --> 03:48:41.740]   to put a bullet in your head and we were
[03:48:41.740 --> 03:48:42.260]   done with you.
[03:48:42.260 --> 03:48:42.940]   Okay.
[03:48:42.940 --> 03:48:44.540]   Fred Hampton, among others.
[03:48:44.540 --> 03:48:47.860]   So, um, but nowadays that's not how the
[03:48:47.860 --> 03:48:48.540]   world works.
[03:48:48.540 --> 03:48:52.460]   So a small number of families cannot
[03:48:52.460 --> 03:48:55.300]   control a country and an economy this size.
[03:48:55.300 --> 03:48:58.500]   New people pop up, well, Mark Zuckerberg
[03:48:58.500 --> 03:49:01.180]   wasn't part of those families, Elon Musk
[03:49:01.180 --> 03:49:03.020]   wasn't part of those families and neither
[03:49:03.020 --> 03:49:04.020]   was Bezos, right?
[03:49:04.020 --> 03:49:06.660]   For, for you to believe those conspiracy
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:08.620]   theories, you have to think that Bezos
[03:49:08.620 --> 03:49:10.980]   and Musk, et cetera, were like, oh, you guys
[03:49:10.980 --> 03:49:12.020]   are still running the country.
[03:49:12.020 --> 03:49:12.740]   No problem.
[03:49:12.740 --> 03:49:13.220]   Go ahead.
[03:49:13.220 --> 03:49:15.900]   Going to do that.
[03:49:15.900 --> 03:49:16.420]   Right.
[03:49:16.420 --> 03:49:20.100]   So now we've gotten into a system where
[03:49:20.100 --> 03:49:21.620]   it's the invisible hand of the market that
[03:49:21.620 --> 03:49:23.940]   runs the country, but unfortunately it's
[03:49:23.940 --> 03:49:25.420]   for only for the powerful.
[03:49:25.420 --> 03:49:29.100]   And so it's more of a machine and they
[03:49:29.100 --> 03:49:31.220]   don't do, and this is super interesting
[03:49:31.220 --> 03:49:32.460]   in ties to what we were talking about
[03:49:32.460 --> 03:49:34.620]   earlier, Lex, which is that they don't do
[03:49:34.620 --> 03:49:36.220]   political assassinations anymore.
[03:49:36.220 --> 03:49:38.300]   They do character assassinations.
[03:49:38.900 --> 03:49:40.580]   That's the needle in the haystack thing.
[03:49:40.580 --> 03:49:43.700]   So, and if you do an assassination
[03:49:43.700 --> 03:49:46.820]   of someone, you build up their status.
[03:49:46.820 --> 03:49:48.940]   They become a martyr and you build up their
[03:49:48.940 --> 03:49:52.060]   cause, but if you do a character assassination,
[03:49:52.060 --> 03:49:55.380]   you smear the cause with the person and the
[03:49:55.380 --> 03:49:57.100]   cause goes down, not up.
[03:49:57.100 --> 03:50:01.180]   So the market found a better way of getting
[03:50:01.180 --> 03:50:03.220]   rid of agitating outsiders.
[03:50:03.220 --> 03:50:04.860]   Well, that's, you know, one of the
[03:50:04.860 --> 03:50:08.420]   conspiracy theories of Epstein is that he's
[03:50:08.420 --> 03:50:12.700]   a front for like a, I guess CIA and they're
[03:50:12.700 --> 03:50:18.700]   getting data on people like creepy pedophile
[03:50:18.700 --> 03:50:23.220]   kind of data to the, they can use to then
[03:50:23.220 --> 03:50:25.500]   threaten character assassination and then
[03:50:25.500 --> 03:50:28.100]   they put them in this way, put the people
[03:50:28.100 --> 03:50:28.900]   in their pockets.
[03:50:28.900 --> 03:50:32.020]   So look, we're not in on it.
[03:50:32.020 --> 03:50:33.900]   So we, there's no way we can know, right.
[03:50:34.020 --> 03:50:36.940]   But the, I just always go back to logic.
[03:50:36.940 --> 03:50:42.340]   So he has dirt on a lot of powerful people.
[03:50:42.340 --> 03:50:45.340]   He dies in a way that is an obvious
[03:50:45.340 --> 03:50:46.700]   murder and not a suicide.
[03:50:46.700 --> 03:50:49.740]   And then you begin to think who would
[03:50:49.740 --> 03:50:52.420]   have enough power to be able to get away
[03:50:52.420 --> 03:50:53.100]   with that crime.
[03:50:53.100 --> 03:50:57.220]   And that is a very limited number of either
[03:50:57.220 --> 03:50:59.700]   people or governments, right?
[03:50:59.700 --> 03:51:03.740]   So that's probably your answer without
[03:51:03.740 --> 03:51:05.460]   knowing anything that's internal.
[03:51:05.460 --> 03:51:06.260]   Yeah.
[03:51:06.260 --> 03:51:06.940]   That's crazy.
[03:51:06.940 --> 03:51:08.820]   We don't have the list of clients.
[03:51:08.820 --> 03:51:12.580]   What is the best way to achieve stability
[03:51:12.580 --> 03:51:15.540]   and peace in Israel and Palestine in the
[03:51:15.540 --> 03:51:19.020]   current situation and in the next five, 10 years?
[03:51:19.020 --> 03:51:22.540]   If people wanted to get to peace, it's
[03:51:22.540 --> 03:51:23.860]   relatively straightforward.
[03:51:23.860 --> 03:51:27.460]   There's already a deal that was negotiated.
[03:51:27.460 --> 03:51:28.780]   The Saudis agreed to it.
[03:51:28.780 --> 03:51:31.540]   And they're an important player in this
[03:51:31.540 --> 03:51:34.100]   game, the Palestinians and the Israelis
[03:51:34.100 --> 03:51:35.620]   have initially agreed to it.
[03:51:35.620 --> 03:51:37.420]   Even Hamas has kind of agreed to it.
[03:51:37.420 --> 03:51:39.900]   That deal exists and it's just waiting
[03:51:39.900 --> 03:51:41.180]   on the shelf to get done.
[03:51:41.180 --> 03:51:41.620]   Right.
[03:51:41.620 --> 03:51:43.420]   And it's pretty straightforward.
[03:51:43.420 --> 03:51:45.420]   Israel gets out of the West bank and
[03:51:45.420 --> 03:51:48.660]   Gaza strip, but they keep it X percentage.
[03:51:48.660 --> 03:51:51.860]   It used to be 4%, then it went up to 6%.
[03:51:51.860 --> 03:51:53.380]   It's probably a higher number now.
[03:51:53.380 --> 03:51:55.900]   The Palestinians keep losing leverage as we go.
[03:51:55.900 --> 03:51:56.300]   Right.
[03:51:56.300 --> 03:51:59.060]   So you remember how hard it was to get a
[03:51:59.060 --> 03:52:00.300]   deal on Ukraine, I thought.
[03:52:00.660 --> 03:52:02.340]   Uh, that's a very complicated one.
[03:52:02.340 --> 03:52:04.260]   Israel is much more straightforward.
[03:52:04.260 --> 03:52:05.940]   Get the hell out of the occupying
[03:52:05.940 --> 03:52:08.500]   territories, keep some of the God, like
[03:52:08.500 --> 03:52:10.980]   those settlements are the worst thing.
[03:52:10.980 --> 03:52:11.900]   They're cancer.
[03:52:11.900 --> 03:52:14.020]   But anyway, I don't know there's, but there
[03:52:14.020 --> 03:52:15.460]   is an answer to the settlements and it's
[03:52:15.460 --> 03:52:17.420]   probably that Israel keeps them, even though
[03:52:17.420 --> 03:52:19.660]   that drives me crazy, no right of return for
[03:52:19.660 --> 03:52:21.900]   Palestinians, there'll be symbolic right of
[03:52:21.900 --> 03:52:23.340]   return for a couple of families.
[03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:26.300]   And so Palestinians go, Oh, no way guys,
[03:52:26.300 --> 03:52:27.340]   you have no leverage.
[03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:29.060]   Take the deal, take the deal.
[03:52:29.060 --> 03:52:29.660]   Okay.
[03:52:30.060 --> 03:52:31.580]   So you're not going to get a right of
[03:52:31.580 --> 03:52:32.940]   return to Israel, it's not going to allow
[03:52:32.940 --> 03:52:35.340]   millions of Palestinians to go and vote in
[03:52:35.340 --> 03:52:37.380]   Israel, it would end the Jewish state.
[03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:39.700]   You have to get to a practical solution.
[03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:43.700]   So honestly, the number one person
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:45.260]   blocking it now is Netanyahu.
[03:52:45.260 --> 03:52:46.980]   It's not even, that's obvious.
[03:52:46.980 --> 03:52:48.780]   That's, that doesn't take a lot of
[03:52:48.780 --> 03:52:50.180]   courage to say that.
[03:52:50.180 --> 03:52:53.140]   He says publicly, I don't want a Palestinian
[03:52:53.140 --> 03:52:55.100]   state, I'm against a two state solution.
[03:52:55.100 --> 03:52:56.580]   He's been monstrous.
[03:52:56.580 --> 03:52:57.980]   He's one of the worst terrorists of my
[03:52:57.980 --> 03:53:00.820]   lifetime, um, so that's easy.
[03:53:00.820 --> 03:53:02.980]   The right wing of Israel has lost its mind.
[03:53:02.980 --> 03:53:06.420]   So the Smotrich and the Ben-Gavir is openly
[03:53:06.420 --> 03:53:08.380]   talking about ethnic cleansing and driving
[03:53:08.380 --> 03:53:10.060]   them into other Arab countries.
[03:53:10.060 --> 03:53:11.860]   Um, I mean, this is the definition
[03:53:11.860 --> 03:53:12.620]   of ethnic cleansing.
[03:53:12.620 --> 03:53:18.980]   So, but is like, I know that the Arabs
[03:53:18.980 --> 03:53:19.780]   are going to take the deal.
[03:53:19.780 --> 03:53:23.580]   Saudi Arabia cannot wait to take the deal
[03:53:23.580 --> 03:53:25.860]   cause they just want to get business going, right?
[03:53:25.860 --> 03:53:27.340]   Do you think Hamas takes the deal?
[03:53:27.980 --> 03:53:30.580]   So I had a solution where you don't need
[03:53:30.580 --> 03:53:32.500]   Hamas, but yes, Hamas would definitely
[03:53:32.500 --> 03:53:32.940]   take the deal.
[03:53:32.940 --> 03:53:34.660]   Hamas already publicly said that they
[03:53:34.660 --> 03:53:37.260]   would even get rid of, uh, that Israel
[03:53:37.260 --> 03:53:39.340]   doesn't have a right to exist, but our,
[03:53:39.340 --> 03:53:41.420]   we, there's so much propaganda in American
[03:53:41.420 --> 03:53:42.940]   media, it's maddening, right?
[03:53:42.940 --> 03:53:45.660]   So, and this idea that you don't deal
[03:53:45.660 --> 03:53:48.460]   with Hamas is so dumb.
[03:53:48.460 --> 03:53:51.500]   So the reason it's dumb is you don't
[03:53:51.500 --> 03:53:53.380]   negotiate with your friends.
[03:53:53.380 --> 03:53:55.460]   You negotiate with your enemies.
[03:53:55.940 --> 03:53:57.740]   Well, I don't want to negotiate with them.
[03:53:57.740 --> 03:53:58.220]   I don't like them.
[03:53:58.220 --> 03:53:59.460]   Well, then you're not going to get to peace.
[03:53:59.460 --> 03:53:59.860]   Right.
[03:53:59.860 --> 03:54:02.500]   But still there is a path that doesn't
[03:54:02.500 --> 03:54:03.300]   include Hamas.
[03:54:03.300 --> 03:54:06.180]   So make a deal with Fatah that runs
[03:54:06.180 --> 03:54:07.700]   the best West bank.
[03:54:07.700 --> 03:54:11.940]   Then they get, right now Fatah went into
[03:54:11.940 --> 03:54:14.380]   Gaza Strip, they wouldn't be able to manage
[03:54:14.380 --> 03:54:16.020]   it because they don't have enough credibility.
[03:54:16.020 --> 03:54:18.380]   They're mainly seen as in cahoots with the
[03:54:18.380 --> 03:54:21.220]   occupiers, whereas Hamas is hardcore and
[03:54:21.220 --> 03:54:22.580]   fighting against the occupiers.
[03:54:23.140 --> 03:54:26.820]   But if Fatah delivers a peace, not only a
[03:54:26.820 --> 03:54:29.820]   peace deal, but a Palestinian state, then
[03:54:29.820 --> 03:54:31.420]   they come in as heroes.
[03:54:31.420 --> 03:54:33.300]   So you make the deal with them.
[03:54:33.300 --> 03:54:36.020]   You let them run the Gaza Strip and you
[03:54:36.020 --> 03:54:38.140]   empower them to drive out Hamas.
[03:54:38.140 --> 03:54:41.540]   That way they do your dirty work for
[03:54:41.540 --> 03:54:42.580]   you in a sense, right?
[03:54:42.580 --> 03:54:44.220]   But good, because Hamas is a terrorist
[03:54:44.220 --> 03:54:46.220]   organization, they're not helpful.
[03:54:46.220 --> 03:54:48.660]   And especially if the Palestinians get a
[03:54:48.660 --> 03:54:52.020]   state, the violence has to stop immediately.
[03:54:52.180 --> 03:54:53.260]   That's the whole point.
[03:54:53.260 --> 03:54:55.660]   The trade is you get a state,
[03:54:55.660 --> 03:54:57.860]   Israel gets safety and peace.
[03:54:57.860 --> 03:54:59.700]   So no more rockets than Israel.
[03:54:59.700 --> 03:55:00.740]   No more rockets.
[03:55:00.740 --> 03:55:04.420]   If you do any other rockets when, and Israel
[03:55:04.420 --> 03:55:07.580]   does the barbaric thing they just did, even
[03:55:07.580 --> 03:55:09.700]   I would say, Hey brother, we had a peace deal.
[03:55:09.700 --> 03:55:10.380]   Okay.
[03:55:10.380 --> 03:55:13.300]   So if you violate a peace deal and you do a
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:14.580]   bomb, they're going to do a bomb and their
[03:55:14.580 --> 03:55:15.700]   bomb is much larger.
[03:55:15.700 --> 03:55:16.380]   Okay.
[03:55:16.380 --> 03:55:19.740]   So that, and by the way, can it work?
[03:55:19.740 --> 03:55:20.860]   It already has worked.
[03:55:21.060 --> 03:55:23.540]   The Israel already did it with, with Egypt.
[03:55:23.540 --> 03:55:27.220]   So Egypt was a hundred times Hamas.
[03:55:27.220 --> 03:55:30.780]   Egypt gathered all the Arab armies and
[03:55:30.780 --> 03:55:32.540]   actually physically invaded Israel when
[03:55:32.540 --> 03:55:33.620]   Israel could lose.
[03:55:33.620 --> 03:55:35.140]   And they did it several times.
[03:55:35.140 --> 03:55:39.740]   And Lex at the time, all, not just the right,
[03:55:39.740 --> 03:55:42.780]   like the, the Warhawks, but most people
[03:55:42.780 --> 03:55:45.580]   thought there's no way Egypt will keep that
[03:55:45.580 --> 03:55:46.080]   peace deal.
[03:55:46.080 --> 03:55:47.980]   Oh, they're suckers.
[03:55:47.980 --> 03:55:50.500]   We're giving them the Sinai Peninsula
[03:55:50.500 --> 03:55:52.900]   back, and then they're just going to keep
[03:55:52.900 --> 03:55:54.060]   bombing and attacking us.
[03:55:54.060 --> 03:55:55.620]   There hasn't been a single bomb from
[03:55:55.620 --> 03:55:56.860]   Egypt since the peace deal.
[03:55:56.860 --> 03:55:58.380]   Peace deals work.
[03:55:58.380 --> 03:56:00.420]   War gets you more war.
[03:56:00.420 --> 03:56:02.220]   Peace deals get you peace.
[03:56:02.220 --> 03:56:05.100]   And, and if you should never, this is
[03:56:05.100 --> 03:56:06.260]   true of all of life.
[03:56:06.260 --> 03:56:09.220]   Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
[03:56:09.220 --> 03:56:12.220]   So if you're saying, well, I'm not positive
[03:56:12.220 --> 03:56:14.060]   that a peace deal is going to be perfect.
[03:56:14.060 --> 03:56:16.820]   And, and 12 more rockets might be fired.
[03:56:16.820 --> 03:56:19.460]   Well, brother, what's, what do we have now?
[03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:20.100]   Right.
[03:56:20.180 --> 03:56:21.660]   We have endless rockets now.
[03:56:21.660 --> 03:56:24.260]   If Israel is supposed to be a safe haven
[03:56:24.260 --> 03:56:26.820]   for Jews and I get it and I want it, okay.
[03:56:26.820 --> 03:56:30.940]   Then become a safe haven, the way that
[03:56:30.940 --> 03:56:34.460]   you're a safe haven is stop the occupation.
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:35.980]   It's not complicated.
[03:56:35.980 --> 03:56:38.700]   And, and the reason they're not, let's be
[03:56:38.700 --> 03:56:40.380]   honest, the reason the right wing government
[03:56:40.380 --> 03:56:42.300]   of Israel is not stopping the occupation
[03:56:42.300 --> 03:56:45.020]   is because they want to take more and more land.
[03:56:45.020 --> 03:56:48.260]   And so they have throughout time taken
[03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:50.140]   way more of the West bank than they had
[03:56:50.140 --> 03:56:51.020]   originally.
[03:56:51.020 --> 03:56:54.300]   And now Netanyahu is saying, I want a
[03:56:54.300 --> 03:56:57.540]   corridor at the, in the middle of Gaza.
[03:56:57.540 --> 03:57:00.180]   And I want a corridor at the border of Egypt.
[03:57:00.180 --> 03:57:03.260]   Now we're back to occupying Gaza physically,
[03:57:03.260 --> 03:57:05.620]   let alone through power and et cetera.
[03:57:05.620 --> 03:57:08.620]   So Bibi has to go.
[03:57:08.620 --> 03:57:09.780]   Definitely.
[03:57:09.780 --> 03:57:14.700]   What's the role of US in making a peace
[03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:15.740]   deal like that happen?
[03:57:17.380 --> 03:57:20.060]   It's going to sound outlandish, but I
[03:57:20.060 --> 03:57:23.020]   can get you a ceasefire almost overnight.
[03:57:23.020 --> 03:57:26.380]   If Bibi's gone and because the Israeli
[03:57:26.380 --> 03:57:29.020]   negotiators have said publicly, plea not
[03:57:29.020 --> 03:57:30.900]   publicly got leaked and it was an Israeli
[03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:34.180]   press, you have to give us a little bit of
[03:57:34.180 --> 03:57:34.700]   wiggle room.
[03:57:34.700 --> 03:57:36.220]   If you don't give us a little bit of wiggle
[03:57:36.220 --> 03:57:37.940]   room, obviously they're not going to do the
[03:57:37.940 --> 03:57:38.340]   deal.
[03:57:38.340 --> 03:57:41.020]   And he's like, I know, right.
[03:57:41.020 --> 03:57:42.420]   That's why he's not giving them the wiggle
[03:57:42.420 --> 03:57:42.660]   room.
[03:57:42.660 --> 03:57:46.060]   So don't ask for land in Gaza, get the hell
[03:57:46.060 --> 03:57:47.740]   out of Gaza, you just ceasefire.
[03:57:47.740 --> 03:57:48.780]   That's the easy part.
[03:57:48.780 --> 03:57:52.500]   So the hard part is the occupation,
[03:57:52.500 --> 03:57:53.380]   ending the occupation.
[03:57:53.380 --> 03:57:55.180]   But even that I can get it to you in two
[03:57:55.180 --> 03:57:57.860]   months, as long as Israel actually wants
[03:57:57.860 --> 03:57:58.220]   a deal.
[03:57:58.220 --> 03:58:01.940]   So go to an election, get rid of Netanyahu,
[03:58:01.940 --> 03:58:05.540]   put in, uh, you know, um, Benny Gantz.
[03:58:05.540 --> 03:58:06.820]   Is Benny Gantz an angel?
[03:58:06.820 --> 03:58:08.340]   No, he's the one that ordered all the
[03:58:08.340 --> 03:58:09.860]   bombings of Gaza to begin with.
[03:58:09.860 --> 03:58:10.220]   Right.
[03:58:10.220 --> 03:58:14.860]   He's look, I, Benny Gantz has got massive
[03:58:14.860 --> 03:58:16.300]   war crimes on his record.
[03:58:16.300 --> 03:58:17.260]   So don't worry.
[03:58:17.260 --> 03:58:18.300]   He's not a softie.
[03:58:18.300 --> 03:58:18.900]   Okay.
[03:58:18.900 --> 03:58:21.420]   But he's not my favorite guy in the world
[03:58:21.420 --> 03:58:23.900]   to say the least, but Benny Gantz can do a
[03:58:23.900 --> 03:58:25.100]   peace deal if he wants to.
[03:58:25.100 --> 03:58:29.020]   So look, only one group of people can
[03:58:29.020 --> 03:58:29.940]   actually settle this.
[03:58:29.940 --> 03:58:32.020]   Well, it's actually two groups of people.
[03:58:32.020 --> 03:58:33.700]   One is the Israeli population.
[03:58:33.700 --> 03:58:35.940]   You voted someone who wants to do a peace
[03:58:35.940 --> 03:58:37.140]   deal, you'll get a peace deal.
[03:58:37.140 --> 03:58:37.820]   Okay.
[03:58:37.820 --> 03:58:40.380]   Number two is the American president.
[03:58:40.380 --> 03:58:42.780]   So if I'm the American president, I'm
[03:58:42.780 --> 03:58:44.020]   saying in a hypothetical, right.
[03:58:44.020 --> 03:58:45.460]   Or any American president that actually
[03:58:45.460 --> 03:58:49.100]   wants to get a peace deal done, you just
[03:58:49.100 --> 03:58:49.940]   say, I'm going to cut the funding.
[03:58:49.940 --> 03:58:51.660]   Israel will do the deal immediately.
[03:58:51.660 --> 03:58:53.660]   They don't say they want to cut the
[03:58:53.660 --> 03:58:55.180]   funding because AIPAC gives them a hundred
[03:58:55.180 --> 03:58:55.820]   million dollars.
[03:58:55.820 --> 03:58:58.100]   It's not complicated.
[03:58:58.100 --> 03:59:00.420]   Not 1% complicated.
[03:59:00.420 --> 03:59:01.380]   Yeah.
[03:59:01.380 --> 03:59:02.740]   So Lex, tell me this.
[03:59:02.740 --> 03:59:03.220]   Okay.
[03:59:03.220 --> 03:59:06.620]   So if the U S president said, uh, I'm
[03:59:06.620 --> 03:59:07.380]   going to cut the funding.
[03:59:07.380 --> 03:59:09.820]   Do you think that it might have a giant
[03:59:09.820 --> 03:59:10.940]   problem for Netanyahu?
[03:59:10.940 --> 03:59:12.100]   Might it hurt his government?
[03:59:12.100 --> 03:59:13.620]   Might they have to go to an election?
[03:59:13.900 --> 03:59:15.900]   Would Israeli politicians, let alone
[03:59:15.900 --> 03:59:18.020]   the population begin to really, really
[03:59:18.020 --> 03:59:19.380]   worry that they're going to lose an
[03:59:19.380 --> 03:59:21.220]   enormous source of funding and weapons?
[03:59:21.220 --> 03:59:23.220]   Yeah, absolutely.
[03:59:23.220 --> 03:59:23.660]   Absolutely.
[03:59:23.660 --> 03:59:25.300]   So why wouldn't we use our leverage?
[03:59:25.300 --> 03:59:27.300]   It's crazy not to use our leverage.
[03:59:27.300 --> 03:59:28.900]   Yeah.
[03:59:28.900 --> 03:59:33.540]   Uh, and this is where we go back to
[03:59:33.540 --> 03:59:34.620]   the steel man of Trump.
[03:59:34.620 --> 03:59:36.340]   It feels like he's the only one crazy
[03:59:36.340 --> 03:59:39.580]   enough to, to use that leverage by crazy.
[03:59:39.580 --> 03:59:41.820]   I mean, in a good kind of sense, bold
[03:59:41.820 --> 03:59:44.220]   enough, not giving a shit about convention,
[03:59:44.220 --> 03:59:46.260]   not giving a shit about pressures and money
[03:59:46.260 --> 03:59:47.820]   and influence and all that kind of stuff.
[03:59:47.820 --> 03:59:49.380]   Yes.
[03:59:49.380 --> 03:59:51.180]   But with the biggest asterisk in the
[03:59:51.180 --> 03:59:54.060]   history of the world, which is 12% chance
[03:59:54.060 --> 03:59:56.780]   he does that, and that's great, but in
[03:59:56.780 --> 03:59:59.700]   huge chance, he does the opposite and he
[03:59:59.700 --> 04:00:03.100]   goes, let's call it 80 again, 80%.
[04:00:03.100 --> 04:00:03.740]   Oh yeah.
[04:00:03.740 --> 04:00:05.780]   Uh, Miriam wanted me to give Israel,
[04:00:05.780 --> 04:00:07.060]   West Bank to Israel.
[04:00:07.060 --> 04:00:07.940]   So you have it guys.
[04:00:07.940 --> 04:00:09.860]   Now you just occupy the whole thing forever.
[04:00:09.860 --> 04:00:10.380]   Okay.
[04:00:11.220 --> 04:00:12.620]   Ah, giant war.
[04:00:12.620 --> 04:00:13.020]   Oh yeah.
[04:00:13.020 --> 04:00:14.260]   I'm going to prove how tough I am.
[04:00:14.260 --> 04:00:15.100]   I'm going to nuke Iran.
[04:00:15.100 --> 04:00:15.940]   Oh no.
[04:00:15.940 --> 04:00:16.780]   What are you doing?
[04:00:16.780 --> 04:00:17.180]   What are you doing?
[04:00:17.180 --> 04:00:20.100]   Like Trump is a massive risk.
[04:00:20.100 --> 04:00:21.740]   He's an enormous amount of risk.
[04:00:21.740 --> 04:00:23.420]   If you were running a company and not a
[04:00:23.420 --> 04:00:26.060]   country, would you hire Trump as your CEO?
[04:00:26.060 --> 04:00:28.780]   Everyone watching just screamed inside
[04:00:28.780 --> 04:00:31.220]   their heads, no, okay.
[04:00:31.220 --> 04:00:32.780]   You would never, they take that
[04:00:32.780 --> 04:00:34.020]   kind of risk with your company.
[04:00:34.020 --> 04:00:35.700]   You've got an 80% chance.
[04:00:35.700 --> 04:00:37.020]   The guy's going to blow up the company.
[04:00:37.020 --> 04:00:38.980]   You're no way, no way.
[04:00:38.980 --> 04:00:39.980]   And you know it too.
[04:00:40.340 --> 04:00:42.860]   If you're, especially if you're a businessman,
[04:00:42.860 --> 04:00:44.620]   you know, you're not going to hire that loose
[04:00:44.620 --> 04:00:45.820]   cannon to run your company.
[04:00:45.820 --> 04:00:49.580]   It's, it's unacceptable risk, but you're not wrong.
[04:00:49.580 --> 04:00:52.220]   We talked about it earlier, but as part of that
[04:00:52.220 --> 04:00:54.860]   risk, there's a sliver in there that he could
[04:00:54.860 --> 04:00:56.020]   accidentally do the right thing.
[04:00:56.020 --> 04:00:58.340]   We talked a lot about hope in this
[04:00:58.340 --> 04:01:00.500]   conversation, zooming out.
[04:01:00.500 --> 04:01:02.340]   What gives you hope about the future of this
[04:01:02.340 --> 04:01:04.700]   whole thing of humanity, not just the United
[04:01:04.700 --> 04:01:06.500]   States of us humans on earth.
[04:01:06.500 --> 04:01:09.340]   So why am I center left and not center right?
[04:01:09.380 --> 04:01:10.420]   It gets to that question.
[04:01:10.420 --> 04:01:14.100]   So you look at the polling, not just here
[04:01:14.100 --> 04:01:15.940]   in America, but in almost any country.
[04:01:15.940 --> 04:01:18.100]   And it almost always breaks out to
[04:01:18.100 --> 04:01:19.780]   two-thirds of one-third, right?
[04:01:19.780 --> 04:01:23.700]   Two-thirds of the people say, let's be
[04:01:23.700 --> 04:01:27.300]   empathetic, let's share, let's be, let's do
[04:01:27.300 --> 04:01:29.980]   equality, justice, let's be fair, right?
[04:01:29.980 --> 04:01:32.940]   One-third goes, no, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[04:01:32.940 --> 04:01:33.540]   Okay.
[04:01:33.540 --> 04:01:34.860]   That's just the nature of humanity.
[04:01:34.860 --> 04:01:38.980]   And so, and usually the same third goes, no
[04:01:38.980 --> 04:01:41.820]   change, and the other two-thirds go, well,
[04:01:41.820 --> 04:01:43.620]   some change, right?
[04:01:43.620 --> 04:01:46.900]   So, because if you don't do any change,
[04:01:46.900 --> 04:01:48.380]   you're, you're never going to get to the
[04:01:48.380 --> 04:01:50.260]   right answer for the wisdom of the crowd
[04:01:50.260 --> 04:01:51.860]   to work, for free markets to work, for
[04:01:51.860 --> 04:01:53.980]   everything to work, you have to keep changing
[04:01:53.980 --> 04:01:56.340]   because the times change and the culture
[04:01:56.340 --> 04:01:58.380]   changes and the situation changes, right?
[04:01:58.380 --> 04:02:01.260]   So that's why there's amendments in the
[04:02:01.260 --> 04:02:03.500]   constitution, because you need to be able to
[04:02:03.500 --> 04:02:05.220]   change the document from time to time.
[04:02:05.220 --> 04:02:06.500]   Be careful with it, right?
[04:02:06.900 --> 04:02:09.500]   But you need to allow for an avenue for change.
[04:02:09.500 --> 04:02:13.820]   So now why does the one-third keep winning
[04:02:13.820 --> 04:02:15.220]   in so many different places?
[04:02:15.220 --> 04:02:17.460]   Because they have more money and power.
[04:02:17.460 --> 04:02:19.140]   And by the way, if you're more selfish,
[04:02:19.140 --> 04:02:22.700]   you're more likely to get more money and power.
[04:02:22.700 --> 04:02:23.300]   Right.
[04:02:23.300 --> 04:02:25.420]   And I wish that weren't the case, but it is.
[04:02:25.420 --> 04:02:27.860]   And it, these are not blanket rules.
[04:02:27.860 --> 04:02:28.900]   They're on average.
[04:02:28.900 --> 04:02:33.380]   So that third winds up winning in so many
[04:02:33.380 --> 04:02:36.620]   circumstances, but the bottom line is we are
[04:02:36.620 --> 04:02:39.260]   a species that requires consent.
[04:02:39.260 --> 04:02:44.420]   So, I mean, I'm a stone cold atheist.
[04:02:44.420 --> 04:02:48.500]   So, uh, so I don't think we're kind of like apes.
[04:02:48.500 --> 04:02:50.460]   I think we are apes.
[04:02:50.460 --> 04:02:51.500]   Okay.
[04:02:51.500 --> 04:02:54.740]   And so, and all the scientists out there
[04:02:54.740 --> 04:02:56.180]   are going, well, of course we are.
[04:02:56.180 --> 04:02:58.660]   Everyone else is going, that's crazy.
[04:02:58.660 --> 04:02:59.740]   Okay.
[04:02:59.740 --> 04:03:02.340]   So when you look at it as a species,
[04:03:02.340 --> 04:03:04.180]   different species react in different ways.
[04:03:04.180 --> 04:03:05.820]   Snakes have no empathy cause it's not in
[04:03:05.820 --> 04:03:06.500]   their DNA.
[04:03:06.500 --> 04:03:09.820]   They, and that's why we have a sense of
[04:03:09.820 --> 04:03:10.780]   what a snake does.
[04:03:10.780 --> 04:03:11.220]   Right.
[04:03:11.220 --> 04:03:14.940]   So for good news is for higher level apes
[04:03:14.940 --> 04:03:17.420]   like us, bonobos, chimpanzees, and humans,
[04:03:17.420 --> 04:03:20.700]   we all roughly want consent.
[04:03:20.700 --> 04:03:24.180]   So a chimpanzee, for example, is, has a
[04:03:24.180 --> 04:03:26.620]   violent, uh, you know, reputation and they
[04:03:26.620 --> 04:03:28.780]   are violent and unfortunately we're pretty
[04:03:28.780 --> 04:03:29.380]   close to them.
[04:03:29.380 --> 04:03:33.260]   Uh, but what people don't know is a leader
[04:03:33.260 --> 04:03:35.340]   doesn't win through violence, especially for
[04:03:35.340 --> 04:03:35.940]   bonobos.
[04:03:35.940 --> 04:03:38.820]   They lead, they win by picking lice off of
[04:03:38.820 --> 04:03:42.020]   other chimpanzees, by going and doing favors,
[04:03:42.020 --> 04:03:43.620]   going to a hunt, getting food and giving it
[04:03:43.620 --> 04:03:45.980]   to someone else because what they're gathering
[04:03:45.980 --> 04:03:49.140]   is the consent of the governed and that's how
[04:03:49.140 --> 04:03:50.100]   you become the alpha.
[04:03:50.100 --> 04:03:52.460]   You don't do it through physical dominance,
[04:03:52.460 --> 04:03:53.580]   you do it through consent.
[04:03:53.580 --> 04:03:55.860]   So that's how we're hardwired.
[04:03:55.860 --> 04:03:56.980]   That's in our DNA.
[04:03:56.980 --> 04:04:00.780]   That two thirds in the long run will win and
[04:04:00.780 --> 04:04:03.260]   that, and we will have empathy, we will have
[04:04:03.260 --> 04:04:05.780]   change and that's the hope that we're all
[04:04:05.780 --> 04:04:06.300]   looking for.
[04:04:06.300 --> 04:04:11.660]   Hope has got the numbers, it seems like.
[04:04:11.660 --> 04:04:12.460]   Yeah.
[04:04:12.460 --> 04:04:15.580]   And in fact, one more thing Lex, look at
[04:04:15.580 --> 04:04:19.700]   history, hope and change always win.
[04:04:19.700 --> 04:04:24.060]   And so again, conservers don't catch feelings.
[04:04:24.060 --> 04:04:26.100]   There is a need for conservers because you
[04:04:26.100 --> 04:04:27.380]   have to balance things out.
[04:04:27.380 --> 04:04:30.060]   If you just had, even though wonderful two
[04:04:30.060 --> 04:04:32.180]   thirds, that still wouldn't be the ideal system.
[04:04:32.460 --> 04:04:34.420]   You need, you need a Winston Churchill.
[04:04:34.420 --> 04:04:36.420]   If you're in the middle of world war two, you
[04:04:36.420 --> 04:04:39.300]   need someone to say regulating, you know, six
[04:04:39.300 --> 04:04:41.780]   inspections of the elevators is too many, right?
[04:04:41.780 --> 04:04:44.300]   So you need that balance and conservatives
[04:04:44.300 --> 04:04:46.140]   have a role and it's a really important role.
[04:04:46.140 --> 04:04:50.980]   But having said that they're assigned to losing
[04:04:50.980 --> 04:04:53.060]   throughout history because they're fighting
[04:04:53.060 --> 04:04:54.060]   on losing ground.
[04:04:54.060 --> 04:04:57.340]   A conservative says no change, but the world
[04:04:57.340 --> 04:04:59.340]   is constantly changing.
[04:04:59.340 --> 04:05:00.780]   So they're destined to lose.
[04:05:01.140 --> 04:05:03.940]   That's why the founding fathers won against
[04:05:03.940 --> 04:05:05.380]   the British monarchy.
[04:05:05.380 --> 04:05:07.500]   That's why the civil rights movement won.
[04:05:07.500 --> 04:05:08.540]   They didn't win overnight.
[04:05:08.540 --> 04:05:10.500]   It took them a hundred years to get equal
[04:05:10.500 --> 04:05:13.300]   rights, let alone pass slavery, right?
[04:05:13.300 --> 04:05:15.340]   So we won on women's rights.
[04:05:15.340 --> 04:05:16.460]   We won on gay rights.
[04:05:16.460 --> 04:05:21.180]   We keep winning, but every snapshot in time
[04:05:21.180 --> 04:05:22.820]   makes it feel like we're losing.
[04:05:22.820 --> 04:05:24.860]   There's a bad guy in charge.
[04:05:24.860 --> 04:05:27.420]   We aren't living under corporate rule, et cetera.
[04:05:27.940 --> 04:05:30.820]   But in the long tide of history, change always
[04:05:30.820 --> 04:05:36.060]   wins, so the empathetic, generally speaking left
[04:05:36.060 --> 04:05:39.020]   wing, but again, don't worry about the titles,
[04:05:39.020 --> 04:05:41.020]   right, people get obsessed with the labels.
[04:05:41.020 --> 04:05:43.180]   The two thirds that's empathetic, that includes
[04:05:43.180 --> 04:05:44.580]   a lot of right-wingers, right?
[04:05:44.580 --> 04:05:48.980]   You win at the end in history every single time.
[04:05:48.980 --> 04:05:50.900]   So we fight forward.
[04:05:50.900 --> 04:05:54.540]   We, we, we're tough when we need to be.
[04:05:54.540 --> 04:05:56.540]   We need that willpower to win any fight.
[04:05:56.740 --> 04:05:57.100]   Right.
[04:05:57.100 --> 04:05:59.620]   But we're civil and respectful to the other
[04:05:59.620 --> 04:06:01.340]   side because they are us.
[04:06:01.340 --> 04:06:05.900]   So progressives all the time, we say, look,
[04:06:05.900 --> 04:06:08.180]   and I, this is like the ending of my book,
[04:06:08.180 --> 04:06:12.140]   which is we, for conservatives, you have a
[04:06:12.140 --> 04:06:14.420]   lot of empathy for inside the wagons.
[04:06:14.420 --> 04:06:17.060]   So conservatives are great to their family,
[04:06:17.060 --> 04:06:19.740]   generally speaking, to their community, to
[04:06:19.740 --> 04:06:21.820]   their church, to anyone that's inside the
[04:06:21.820 --> 04:06:25.380]   wagons, but they have, they set up electric
[04:06:25.380 --> 04:06:28.220]   fences and barbed wire around their wagons.
[04:06:28.220 --> 04:06:29.900]   So if you're on the outside, you're the
[04:06:29.900 --> 04:06:31.820]   others, and you're going to get electrified
[04:06:31.820 --> 04:06:34.020]   and it's constant, right?
[04:06:34.020 --> 04:06:36.900]   And so I like to think the left wing
[04:06:36.900 --> 04:06:39.420]   has wider wagons.
[04:06:39.420 --> 04:06:42.460]   So we view the world as more us and not you.
[04:06:42.460 --> 04:06:46.020]   But the good news of that is if we win,
[04:06:46.020 --> 04:06:48.700]   we're not going to do Medicare for only the
[04:06:48.700 --> 04:06:50.260]   left, right?
[04:06:50.260 --> 04:06:52.140]   We're going to do Medicare for all.
[04:06:52.140 --> 04:06:54.220]   You're all going to get universal healthcare.
[04:06:54.540 --> 04:06:56.660]   We're going to do higher wages for all.
[04:06:56.660 --> 04:06:58.460]   The right wing is not going to be left out.
[04:06:58.460 --> 04:07:02.380]   And if we're, and Lex, I can tell you a fun
[04:07:02.380 --> 04:07:07.740]   story, it's, it's about my family and, and
[04:07:07.740 --> 04:07:09.900]   I'm sure that parts of it are apocryphal
[04:07:09.900 --> 04:07:12.020]   from, because it's from like 500 years ago.
[04:07:12.020 --> 04:07:15.780]   Um, but, uh, but it gives you a sense of
[04:07:15.780 --> 04:07:19.500]   the, the old Mark Twain quote, if it's really
[04:07:19.500 --> 04:07:22.060]   Mark Twain's, of change happens really
[04:07:22.060 --> 04:07:27.860]   gradually and then all of a sudden, so my mom's
[04:07:27.860 --> 04:07:30.500]   last name in Turkish is Yavasha, it means
[04:07:30.500 --> 04:07:33.060]   slowly, it's a weird name, even in Turkish.
[04:07:33.060 --> 04:07:36.380]   And so one day we're walking past the mosque
[04:07:36.380 --> 04:07:39.860]   in Istanbul when I'm a kid and it says on the
[04:07:39.860 --> 04:07:43.540]   mosque, Yavasha, we're like, what is this?
[04:07:43.540 --> 04:07:44.300]   Okay.
[04:07:44.300 --> 04:07:45.620]   So it's a small little mosque.
[04:07:45.620 --> 04:07:47.900]   We go inside and my dad starts asking
[04:07:47.900 --> 04:07:48.900]   their mom questions.
[04:07:48.900 --> 04:07:49.420]   Okay.
[04:07:49.780 --> 04:07:53.220]   So he says, why is the mosque named that?
[04:07:53.220 --> 04:07:56.300]   And he said, well, do you don't know?
[04:07:56.300 --> 04:07:58.700]   And he said, because my dad said, my mom,
[04:07:58.700 --> 04:08:00.580]   my wife's name is, last name is Yavasha.
[04:08:00.580 --> 04:08:01.420]   He's like, oh my God.
[04:08:01.420 --> 04:08:05.460]   And he's like, your ancestor was the
[04:08:05.460 --> 04:08:07.980]   admiral of the Ottoman Navy when they
[04:08:07.980 --> 04:08:09.460]   conquered Constantinople.
[04:08:09.460 --> 04:08:10.940]   Okay.
[04:08:10.940 --> 04:08:16.300]   So grandpa from five, 600 years ago came
[04:08:16.300 --> 04:08:16.940]   up with the idea.
[04:08:16.940 --> 04:08:19.100]   So you can't ever conquer Constantinople
[04:08:19.100 --> 04:08:20.540]   because there's a giant chain in the,
[04:08:20.540 --> 04:08:22.580]   underneath the Bosphorus, all the ships
[04:08:22.580 --> 04:08:23.500]   get stuck on the chain.
[04:08:23.500 --> 04:08:25.460]   There's cannons on both sides, half the
[04:08:25.460 --> 04:08:27.140]   ancient navies in the world are at the bottom
[04:08:27.140 --> 04:08:28.380]   of the Bosphorus, right?
[04:08:28.380 --> 04:08:30.420]   So it hasn't been conquered in over a
[04:08:30.420 --> 04:08:31.860]   thousand years, nobody thinks it can be
[04:08:31.860 --> 04:08:32.220]   conquered.
[04:08:32.220 --> 04:08:34.660]   Grandpa comes up with the idea of why don't
[04:08:34.660 --> 04:08:39.300]   we build giant wooden planks over land and
[04:08:39.300 --> 04:08:43.380]   grease them and pass our fleet over land onto
[04:08:43.380 --> 04:08:44.140]   the other side.
[04:08:44.140 --> 04:08:46.500]   Everybody goes, because whenever anybody
[04:08:46.500 --> 04:08:48.660]   poses a new idea, no matter how logical it
[04:08:48.660 --> 04:08:49.900]   is, they go, oh, that's impossible.
[04:08:49.900 --> 04:08:50.820]   No way it's going to work.
[04:08:50.820 --> 04:08:51.980]   Oh, you're crazy.
[04:08:51.980 --> 04:08:53.220]   This is an unconquerable city.
[04:08:53.220 --> 04:08:54.100]   What are you guys even doing?
[04:08:54.100 --> 04:08:56.620]   Everyday Mehmed the Conqueror comes up to
[04:08:56.620 --> 04:09:00.420]   grandpa and says, all right, how's your plan
[04:09:00.420 --> 04:09:01.940]   to do this project going?
[04:09:01.940 --> 04:09:03.980]   And grandpa says, slowly.
[04:09:03.980 --> 04:09:08.420]   And he names him commander slowly.
[04:09:08.420 --> 04:09:11.860]   And one night after the whole thing's done,
[04:09:11.860 --> 04:09:14.740]   they passed the entire Ottoman fleet over
[04:09:14.740 --> 04:09:18.100]   the land, wind up in the middle of the
[04:09:18.100 --> 04:09:22.340]   Bosporus and the Holy Roman Empire concedes.
[04:09:22.340 --> 04:09:25.260]   They surrender because change happens really
[04:09:25.260 --> 04:09:27.180]   gradually and then all of a sudden.
[04:09:27.180 --> 04:09:28.420]   Good story.
[04:09:28.420 --> 04:09:32.900]   Well, Cenk, thank you for fighting for that
[04:09:32.900 --> 04:09:35.700]   change for many years now, for over two decades
[04:09:35.700 --> 04:09:38.500]   now, and thank you for talking today.
[04:09:38.500 --> 04:09:39.940]   Appreciate it, Lex.
[04:09:39.940 --> 04:09:41.140]   Thank you for having the conversation.
[04:09:41.140 --> 04:09:43.620]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:09:43.620 --> 04:09:44.340]   with Cenk Uygur.

[04:09:46.340 --> 04:09:48.020]   sponsors in the description.
[04:09:48.500 --> 04:09:50.060]   And now let me leave you with some
[04:09:50.060 --> 04:09:51.860]   words from Hannah Arend.
[04:09:51.860 --> 04:09:56.020]   Totalitarianism is never content to rule by
[04:09:56.020 --> 04:09:59.500]   external means, namely through the state and
[04:09:59.500 --> 04:10:00.900]   a machinery of violence.
[04:10:00.900 --> 04:10:04.380]   Thanks to its peculiar ideology and the role
[04:10:04.380 --> 04:10:07.180]   assigned to it in the apparatus of coercion,
[04:10:07.180 --> 04:10:10.260]   totalitarianism has discovered a means of
[04:10:10.260 --> 04:10:13.860]   dominating and terrorizing human beings from
[04:10:13.860 --> 04:10:14.380]   within.
[04:10:14.380 --> 04:10:16.660]   Thank you for listening.
[04:10:17.020 --> 04:10:19.060]   I hope to see you next time.
