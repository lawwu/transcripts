[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   A regular listener named Steve from the great city of Omaha, Nebraska, asked this,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.000]   "Pastor John, what does it mean to submit to and obey your leaders in Hebrews 13, 17?"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Yeah, the text says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   As those who will have to give an account, let them do this with joy and not with groaning,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   for that would be of no advantage to you."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And culturally, Tony, the defining spirit of America today is the opposite of that, isn't it?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   It's self-determination, not submission to the will of another.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Anything that enhances my individual liberty to do as I please is good,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and anything that encumbers me and limits my ability to do as I please is bad.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   That's just the wayâ€”that's the spirit we breathe in America.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And that makes this text culturally outrageous.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   "Obey your leaders and submit to them."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And we know from the side of leaders that power corrupts.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So the emphasis must always fall for leadership on servanthood, not lording it over.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Paul said, "Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy."
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   That's the kind of leaders we're supposed to submit to.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   They come alongside, and they work for our joy.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And the New Testament itself says leaders can go wrong.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   They can go bad and disqualify themselves from being obeyed or submitted to.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Acts 20, verse 30, Paul is speaking to the elders, and he says, "From among your own selves,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   men will arise and speak perverse things and draw away the disciples after them."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So there you have people submitting to elders who are taking them to destruction.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And Paul wants to warn the church, "Don't let that happen."
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Same thing in 1 Timothy 5, 19, Paul instructs what to do if an elder is found to be in sin.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He should be disciplined and publicly removed from office if necessary so that the people will not be hurt by that.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Same thing in 1 Peter 5, he tells the elders, "Shepherd the flock of God, exercising oversight,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   not for sordid gain and not lording it over those in your charge."
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So the New Testament is not naive about the abuses of leadership.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And nevertheless, here we have Hebrews 13, 17, "Obey them, submit to them."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Now, what would that mean? Here's my best shot at how it would look.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   There's a certain spirit and a certain limit and a certain shape that leadership has
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and that the people have in response to this verse.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The word "obey" is a very broad word that means "be persuaded by, trust, rely on."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It comes to mean "obey" because that's what you do when you trust somebody.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So you might say it's a soft word for "obey."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It encourages a good relationship of trust but still calls for the people to be swayed by leaders.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So be a swayable person. Be a person ready to learn, ready to be taught, ready to be led.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Not eager to kick and rebel against anybody that calls you to do something at church.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   In other words, "submit" occurs only here in the New Testament, this particular form of "submit," "hupeko."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It's more narrow than the other one and means "make room for by retiring from a seat or yield to or submit to."
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So with all that, I would try to distill the meaning of Hebrews 13, 17, something like this.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   A church should have a people, I, should have a bent toward trusting its leaders.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Be bent that way. Don't be a distrustful people.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Second, I should have a disposition to be supportive in my attitudes and actions toward the goals and the directions of the leaders
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   if they craft a vision and they set some goals, be supportive. Go with them.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I think it means we should want to imitate their faith, and I think it means we should have a happy inclination to comply with their instructions.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And if you listen carefully at those several paraphrases of what I think this means,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I've used phrases like "a bent towards trusting" and "disposition towards support" and "wanting to imitate" and "inclination to comply."
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   The reason for that kind of phraseology is to capture both sides of the biblical truth, namely,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   "Elders are fallible and should not lord it over the flock and are not absolute." God is absolute.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yet, the flock should follow good leadership. Our hearts should be bent and our disposition should be that way
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and our wants should be that way and our inclination should be that way.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And where those two truths are working, it's a beautiful thing in a church.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   In fact, as I look back, Tony, over the 33 years I enjoyed at Bethlehem,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   it was a wonderful thing to have an eldership and a people who, while not being naive, unbiblical, "Yes, men, I don't think we've produced a cult,"
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   there was a sweet experience of, if I tried to rally them for something, they were basically ready and eager to be rallied for biblical things.
