[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint John,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   in the fifth chapter and verse 36.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   The 36th verse in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   But I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the Father hath given me to finish,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   the same works that I do bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the Father hath given me to finish,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   the same works that I do bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   The whole of Christianity, as we must never forget,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   ultimately depends upon the one question as to who was Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   That is the central question, the central matter.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Christianity is not primarily a teaching or a philosophy.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I go on saying this kind of thing because I have to say it,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   because those who regard it as but a teaching or a philosophy go on saying the other.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And, of course, because of the misunderstanding of the world,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   it is the kind of thing to which publicity is given.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   That's the sort of Christianity you find in the newspapers,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   that it's a teaching, a philosophy primarily, an attitude towards various questions.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Now, while, of course, I agree that Christianity does have its teaching with respect to the whole of life,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   it is infinitely more important to indicate this,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   that before we begin to consider the Christian teaching with regard to anything,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   we must know what Christianity is and exactly what it means to be a Christian.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That, obviously, is the first thing.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And this idea that it is nothing but a point of view or a teaching,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   one of such teachings amidst a number of competing teachings,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   is, I want to try to demonstrate once more,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   a complete and final misunderstanding of the New Testament teaching itself.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   The first question, therefore, I say is,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   is the Lord Jesus Christ himself?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Who is he? What is he?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Until we are clear about that, it's a waste of time to discuss or to consider anything else whatsoever.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   The big question before us is, who is he and what was he doing in this world?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Now, that is the question that stands out, surely, on the very surface of the four Gospels,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and indeed in the book of the Acts of the Apostles and all the New Testament epistles.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's all about him. This is the great matter.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And until we are clear, I say, about him,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   we cannot of necessity be clear about anything else.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He himself is more important than his teaching,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   because, in a sense, his most important teaching is always about himself.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So that the great question that stands before us once more is this,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   what think ye of Christ?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Whose son is he?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Who is this person about whom we read in the pages of the New Testament?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Well now then, that is the very question that is brought before us in this 36th verse of this 5th chapter of John's Gospel
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   that we are looking at this evening.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Indeed, those who attend here regularly will know that that is the one big question in the whole of the chapter.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And you remember how the question arises, how it originally arose in this chapter.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It all arose because of something our Lord did on a certain Sabbath day.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   He was up in Jerusalem and he went to the pool of Bethesda.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   He knew that there was always congregated a large number of sick people, lame and halt,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and blind and in various other conditions,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and that they were there poor things because they believed, as everybody did,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   that the first person who got into that pool of Bethesda when its waters were stirred would be healed.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So they gathered together in the hope that they might have the opportunity and might be the fortunate person.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, you remember the story.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Our Lord approaches a particular man who was sitting on his mat there and asked him the question,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   asked him if he'd like to be made whole.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And the man pointed out how hopeless it all was, that he'd been like this now for 38 years,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   and that he'd come there in the hope he might be the fortunate one, but there was always somebody else.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   He hadn't got a servant to put him in, other people had, and there he was in his utter hopelessness.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But our Lord, without doing anything about the pool of Bethesda,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   suddenly commends him to rise up and take up his pallet and walk.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And the man did so.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Now that, you see, led to trouble.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   The Jewish authorities were very upset by this.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Not, of course, upset because the man had been healed, but because the man had been healed on the Sabbath,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   which meant to them the breaking of the law.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And therefore, Jesus of Nazareth, they deduced, must be an evil person,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   because here he is breaking God's law, violating the Sabbath, doing this sort of thing on a Sabbath day.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And they approach our Lord and they argue with him about this,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and the argument immediately becomes an argument about himself, about his person.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Because he doesn't hesitate to turn to them and to say,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   "My Father worketh hitherto and I work."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And then they became furious.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   They said, "Now, you've not only broken the law of the Sabbath, but you're blaspheming,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   you're claiming that you're equal with God."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And he went on to tell them that he was.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That his will was one with the Father's.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   That he never did anything in and of himself.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   That all he was doing, God had showed him and God had told him to do.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And all he said had been spoken to him by God and God had commended him to repeat it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   He specifically claims that he is the Son of God.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   One in nature, one in mind, one in everything.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And that God has given him to have life in himself.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Indeed, he says, God has appointed him to be judge of the world.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And here they are listening to him and hating him and hating it all.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   He's been bearing witness to himself.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But they won't accept it. Indeed, they reject it.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And our Lord, understanding this, says to them,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   "Well, I know if I bear witness of myself, you will say that my witness is not true."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "All right," he says, "I'll accept it."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "Because there is another that beareth witness of me."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   "And I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's a reference to God.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   He says, "God has borne witness of me."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   How has God borne witness of him? He goes on to tell them.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   The first is, he says, "You yourself sent to John the Baptist,"
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   "and he bare witness unto the truth."
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And they are done so.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And we've been considering together how John the Baptist did bear witness unto him.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   He said, "Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He said, "I indeed baptize you with water,"
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   "but one mightier than I cometh after me, the lecher to whose shoe I am unworthy to unloose."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire,"
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,"
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   "and will gather the wheat into the garner,"
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's John's witness.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   But as he tells them, "He was a burning and a shining light, John the Baptist."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   "And you," he says, "were willing for a season to rejoice in his light,"
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   "but then you turned against him."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   "But wait a minute," he says, "I haven't finished."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   "I have a greater witness than that of John,"
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   "for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, to complete,"
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   "the same works that I am doing bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now then, that's what I want to consider with you this evening.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   You see, he's talking still about himself.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   He won't let these people go.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   He says, "I receive not testimony from men,"
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "but these things I say unto you that you might be saved."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   In spite of their obduracy and their recalcitrance,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   in spite of their enmity and malice and spite,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   he goes on speaking to them.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   He's pleading with them.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   He says, "You won't listen to me?"
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   "You accepted for a while the testimony of John,"
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   "then you turned your backs on it?"
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   "Now listen, I haven't finished even yet."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "There's a further bit of testimony."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "There is further evidence."
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   He pleads with them to listen.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   He says, "Look at these works that I'm doing."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   "The testimony and the witness of his works and his actions."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And he says, "This is stronger than the witness and the evidence of John."
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   John spoke and bore his witness.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Poor John, he got a bit confused later on in prison
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   and became a bit uncertain and sent his messengers.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And now he's been put to death.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Here's something greater. It goes on.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You can see these things, the works.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Look at them. Face the facts and the evidence.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Well, very well, that's the thing I say
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   to which I want to call your attention tonight.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   These works of Christ,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   as they bear witness and their testimony
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and their evidence to him and to his person.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   What does he mean by talking about these works?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Well, first and foremost, undoubtedly,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   he was referring to the miracles which he worked.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   But I don't take the view that it applies only to the miracles.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I think it includes everything that he did in the character of the Messiah.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I believe it includes all his teaching,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   the words that the Father gave him, as well as the works.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I believe it includes all that he taught about his Father
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and the revelation he gave of his Father.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I believe it included his sinless life, his honoring of the law.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I believe it included his death upon the cross,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   his rising again. These are all part of his works.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But primarily, I do think, and I agree with those who say so,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   that it refers to the miracles which he worked and which he performed.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So what he is saying, in a sense, is this.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Look at the evidence and the testimony of these miracles that I am working.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   He has just worked one.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   This man, whom they knew so well, who had been ill for 38 years,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   but who suddenly is walking about the place
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and carrying his bed upon his back.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Look at it, he says. Face the facts.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And all these other miracles.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   His point is that these things proclaim plainly and clearly who he is.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And this, I say, is the supreme metaphor for us this evening.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Am I speaking to someone who does not believe in Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Have you considered the evidence of the miracles?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Have you considered the importance that is attached to them in the New Testament?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   He himself calls attention to them.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   He does so here.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   He does so in the tenth chapter, which we read together at the beginning.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Did you notice it?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   "Then came the Jews round about him and said unto him,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   How long dost thou make us to doubt?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly."
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   This is what he said.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Jesus answered them, I told you, and you would not believe.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   But he said, The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Why don't you believe them?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And then later on in the same chapter he says,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   But if I do, though ye believe not me, if you don't believe what I say,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Believe the works that ye may know, and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And you know later on, you will find in the fourteenth chapter,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   he says exactly the same thing again.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   He says, Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   or else believe me for the very works sake.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Now there he is, pointing directly to the evidence of the miracles,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   which he was working before their eyes.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And then you remember there is that other notable illustration of the same thing.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   A very exceptional one, and that's why I single it out.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   The reply he gave when John the Baptist did send his two disciples on that occasion
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   with the question, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Poor John languishing in the prison, his poor body in a bad state,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   suffering from depression.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   He sends his messengers, "Are you the coming Messiah?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I thought you were. Are you really, or must we begin to look for somebody else?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Tell us."
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And this was the reply he sent back, you remember, with John.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   With the disciples to John, he said, "Go back and tell John again
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   the things that he do see and hear."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   What are they?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   "The deaf hear, the dead are raised, and unto the poor the gospel is preached.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Go back and tell him that.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Put before him the evidence of the miracles that I am working and performing,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   and that are to be seen of all men."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Now that is our Lord's own use of the miracles.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And as you know, this gospel according to John
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   always uses the term "signs" with respect to these miracles.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You remember that he worked that miracle in Cana of Galilee
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   of turning water into wine, and John says, "This first sign did he perform."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And all the other miracles John refers to as "signs."
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Now there is our Lord's own use of them.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   But you see, the apostles made precisely the same use of these miracles.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Let me give you an illustration or two.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Look at the apostle Peter preaching the first sermon
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   that in a sense was ever preached under the auspices of the Christian church.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is the kind of thing he said.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   He said, "You men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   as you yourselves know, him being delivered by the determinate counsel,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and for knowledge of God ye have crucified, etc.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   But you notice he holds before them the miracles which they themselves had seen."
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Not only does Peter do it there, he does it when again he preaches in the house of Cornelius.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   You'll find that in the tenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostle
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   in verses 38 and 39.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   He says, "I'm telling you this, the word I say you know,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   after the baptism which John preached,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   for God was with him, and we are witnesses of all things that he did,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem."
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Now that was the essence of the apostolic preaching.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   That is what they all preached, not only Peter but Paul and all the others.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Indeed the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, for me to give you my final bit of evidence,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   puts this perfectly plainly in his second chapter when he puts it like this.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He says, "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   and was afterward confirmed unto us by them that heard him,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders and divers miracles
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his will."
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   In other words, for me to sum up this bit of evidence,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   all the reports which we are given of his miracles in the pages of the four Gospels
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   are really designed to that one end, there to show us and to prove to us who he was,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   that he is indeed the Son of God, the long expected Messiah.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   It is a part of the case of Christianity in order to establish and proclaim who he is
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and why he has come.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Very well then, there is the evidence that confronts us this evening,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and I want to use it in this way.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   I want to ask a question.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   What of you, my friend, made of that evidence?
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Do you believe it?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Have you accepted it?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Do you believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Do you really believe that this tremendous, staggering thing is literally and actually taking place,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that at that given point of time the only begotten Son of God came out of heaven
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and came into this world, was born as a babe in Bethlehem, grew up, lived as a man,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   lived as a carpenter at the age of thirty, began to preach,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   and went about doing the things that are recorded in the pages of the four Gospels?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Do you believe that that was the Son of God?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Is it to you the biggest thing and the biggest fact in your life and in the whole of history tonight
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   that God has sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law?
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Is your whole life depending upon that?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Now that is the question.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Because if it isn't, according to this book, you're lost.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   He says, "These things I say that you might be saved."
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Is this the thing you believe?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And if you don't believe it, have you considered this evidence?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Have you considered the evidence of his works, the evidence of his miracles?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   "But dear me," says someone, "wait a moment, are you holding a thing like that before us?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Are you forgetting, says someone, that you're living in the twentieth century?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Are you really going to base the case for Christianity still upon the fact of miracles?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Surely," says this man, "this has been one of the greatest difficulties about Christianity.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   No man who is rarely up to date can possibly believe in miracles."
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Now wait a minute, let me take up this question.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I'm bound to do so.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I'm driven to do so because of the prominence which our Lord himself gives them.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   He puts them in the forefront.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   He says, "Here is greater evidence than that of John."
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He says, "If you don't believe my words, believe the works."
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Very well then, let's start like this.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   What is a miracle?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   A miracle, by definition, is an effect which is produced above or beside the ordinary course of nature.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   It is an effect which is produced apart from the operation of those secondary causes
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   by which God is pleased in the ordinary course of providence to govern the physical world.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Normally, God runs this universe by means of what we call secondary causes,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   or if you like, what we call the laws of nature, cause and effect.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Something happens and it leads to something else.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Now that is how God normally runs this world, that is, the ordinary course of providence.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   What's a miracle?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Well, a miracle is God operating apart from those secondary causes, apart from those ordinary laws.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It doesn't mean that he's breaking his laws.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It means that for the time being he is acting above them.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It means and implies and presupposes an extraordinary interposition of God's divine power.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   That is what is meant by a miracle.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Normally, our diseases are healed by certain processes that go on in the body.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You suddenly get an infection into your system. What happens?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Well, God's ordinary way of dealing with that is that he stimulates certain forces in the body called antibodies.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   The white cells are mobilized, the blood rushes the white cells to the seat of infection.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   These antibodies are produced and circulate in the blood.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   That's how it normally happens, secondary causes.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   But God can act immediately and directly, not through secondary causes or agencies, but immediately, directly.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And when he does that, it's a miracle.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   The secondary causes take time. Healing is a comparatively slow process.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   But God can heal in a moment. That's a miracle.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And if it isn't immediate, if it isn't absolute, if it isn't complete, it isn't a miracle.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   But that's what is meant by a miracle, such as the miracles which our Lord worked.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Here's a man who has been crippled for 38 years.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Well, of course, a crippled man can be healed by medical science, but it'll probably take a long time.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   He'll have to have massage and electrical treatment, physiotherapy, and he gets a little bit better.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Of course, his muscles have become atrophied, and you can't suddenly make him stand up and walk.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   But our Lord looked at this man who hadn't walked for 38 years, and he just said to him,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   "Rise, take up thy bed and walk," and he did so immediately. That's a miracle.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   It means that there is this divine power operating, not secondary causes any longer,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   but this immediacy, God acting above the ordinary manner and doing a thing in all the might of his eternal power.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   That's what we mean by a miracle.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   But now, of course, you'll realize at once that there's a great deal of confusion about miracles,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   and I just want to look at two or three of the confusions. Here's one.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   There are some people who are too ready to call a thing a miracle. I start with them.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   There are people who say, at the slightest provocation, "It's a miracle," when it isn't a miracle.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   If you can explain a thing by natural causes, do so.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   A miracle is not usual, it's not ordinary, it's most extraordinary.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Don't invoke the miraculous unless it's absolutely essential. A thing may appear very wonderful to you,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   but if there is another explanation, well, give the other explanation.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I've seen many people who've told me that they've had miracles worked upon them. I've not been satisfied.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I could explain everything that's happened to them by other means and methods.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It may be very remarkable, yes, but remarkable things can happen.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   The influence of mind over matter is quite extraordinary.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And, you see, we sometimes think we are much worse than we are, and suddenly we are put right by a psychological shock.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   You've read of people, perhaps, men who in the first war suddenly became blind because a shell exploded near them.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   You've read of such cases, haven't you?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And then many years later, something exciting was happening in the company where they were sitting,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   and suddenly their eyesight came back. That's not a miracle. That can easily be explained.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   There are these temporary conditions from which we suffer, which are put right by certain natural shocks.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Don't call things like that miracles. We have a natural explanation for them.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   So let's get rid of that difficulty.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   It is a greater disservice to the Christian message to claim that things are miracles when they're not,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   as the second difficulty, which is to deny the possibility of miracles altogether.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Now, you're familiar with this. There are people who say miracles are impossible.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Matthew Arnold said it a hundred years ago.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   He said, "Miracles have never happened because miracles cannot happen."
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And there it was. There was no more to be said. Matthew Arnold had spoken.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Miracles haven't happened because miracles cannot happen.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   But that's begging the question. The question is, cannot they happen?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Is it impossible for a miracle to take place? Why did Matthew Arnold say that?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Well, Matthew Arnold said that, of course, because he lived when he lived, a hundred years ago.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   You know, anybody who says that sort of thing now is very much behind the time.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Did you know that?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Well, Matthew Arnold said that, of course, because he lived when he lived, a hundred years ago.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   You know, anybody who says that sort of thing now is very much behind the time.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Did you know that?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   If you say now that miracles cannot happen for the reason that Matthew Arnold said it,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   you're just showing that you're not up to date in your scientific reading.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Why did he say that, and everybody who said it with him in the last century?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Well, they said it because of their view of matter.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Matter, they said, is an inert substance.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   The atom was indivisible, but it was purely material.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Their conception of matter was purely material.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Their conception of things physical was material.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   And therefore they deduced that a miracle could not happen.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   But, you see, they said that sort of thing because they didn't know anything about nuclear physics,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   because they didn't know anything about the nature and the constitution of the atom.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   What is an atom? Is it inert matter? No, we are told today it's brimful of life.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   It's this terrific energy. It's vital.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   You mustn't talk about inert matter, dead matter. No, no, everything, even elements,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   even iron and things like that, they're alive.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   It's this tremendous power. It's full of life and of vast energy,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   which opens out, of course, these tremendous possibilities for us,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   for future means of heating and so on.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Just the water that's in the sea, just a little of it can heat the whole world, as it were.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You've been reading about zeta and all these things. That's the new idea.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And the moment you accept these new ideas, you must no longer say that miracles cannot happen.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   If you go on talking like that, you just show that you're still living in the 19th century instead of the 20th.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   With this new understanding, even in a scientific sense,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   we see how easily these miracles can happen,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   because of the nature of life and all that God has made.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   The God who has made all these things, oh, He just has to influence them.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And you see everything taking a different form and being changed. And that's a miracle.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   So, my dear friend, if you think that you can avoid and evade Jesus of Nazareth
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   because you say you can't believe in miracles,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and oh, how many have said that and have gone to their graves saying it,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   imagining that they've been very clever.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   They say, "Now, if these claims for miracles were not made, I could have believed in Him,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   but I've got to swallow the miracles and all, and as a scientific man, I cannot."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Oh, the tragedy, I say, of such men, that they were bound by the little bit of scientific knowledge
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   of their own day and generation, which has now been exploded,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and which has gone and is utterly outmoded. You can no longer hide behind that.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   But here is another objection, another difficulty.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   The case of these very Jews to whom our Lord was speaking.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And there are so many like this, they just won't face the evidence at all.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Though these things happened before them, they won't look at them.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And I'm sorry to have to say this has been true of the Christian church as a whole
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   for the last hundred years.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   The Christian church has been saying, "Now, we've got to remember we're living
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   in an educated, enlightened, scientific age, and if we go on talking about miracles,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   people won't listen to us and won't believe the gospel."
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   So they've said nothing about miracles.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Oh, they've been trying to explain them away.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Have you heard their explanation of the feeding of the five thousand?
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   This is the sort of thing they've been saying, to try and explain it away.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   That the boy produced the loaves and the fishes,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and that the others, seeing the readiness of the boy to give his loaves and fishes,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   they all brought out their snacks from their pockets so they were all able to eat.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Isn't it pathetic? Isn't it childish?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   That the Christian church, in our fear of some supposed scientific knowledge,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   should have been denying the faith.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   My dear friends, if these miracles are not true, there's nothing true here.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   They're a part of the testimony.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   They're a part of the apostolic preaching.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   They went round and preached that Jesus would work miracles.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   They said, "You saw them. Why didn't you believe him?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   You saw the evidence. Why didn't you accept it?"
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And it is still a part of the preaching of this gospel.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Why do you believe in Jesus at all?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   You who say that you believe in Jesus without miracles,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   what do you know about Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Why do you believe in him in any sense?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Well, you've got to answer that it's because of what you read about him in the four gospels.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   You know nothing about him apart from what you find here.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And if you are dependent upon these gospels for your knowledge of him,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   how can you honestly say that you'll accept some of it and reject the rest?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   It's all here. Jesus as he is, the teacher and the miracle worker,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   the works he says.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Look at them and believe them and accept them.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   If you don't do that, what you're really doing is this,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   is you're setting yourself up as an authority.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And you say, "What I choose to believe is right, what I choose to reject is wrong."
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Tell me, are you prepared to face eternity on that?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Do you think your opinion or the opinion of any man is sufficient for you to stand on
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   as you die and go on and meet God?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Can't you see that it's unutterable folly?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   You either take these gospels as they are or you reject them in total.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   You have no Jesus of Nazareth apart from the miracle worker,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   the works that he talks about.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   You've got to face them.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Well, let me come then to the last attitude, the right attitude towards these things.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Here is the right attitude towards the miracle.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   The attitude of Nicodemus, who went to him by night and said,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   "Rabbi, Rabbi, thou must be a teacher sent from God,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   You know it was a tremendous thing for that man who was a Pharisee
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and one of the greatest of them, one of the teachers of Israel.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   It was no small thing for that man to risk his reputation
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and to go in the night to have an interview with this carpenter from Nazareth.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Why did he do it?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   He did it because he was an honest man.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   He'd seen the miracle.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And he said, "I've come to you because,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   though I don't understand you and your claims and what you're saying,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I know this much.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   You must be a teacher come from God,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   for no man can do the miracles that thou doest except God be with him.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   You don't understand Nicodemus unless you accept the evidence of the miracles."
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   That's the right attitude.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   But come, let me give you further evidence in the seventh chapter,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   the thirty-first verse, where we read this.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   "Many of the people believed on him and said,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   'When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?'"
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   That's an argument.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   They said, "We've got to face the facts."
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And here they are.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   But take the other famous case,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   the brilliant argumentation of the men, the blind men of the ninth chapter.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   "The man was healed," you remember, "by our Lord."
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   The man who'd been born blind.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   "And yet our Lord in a moment healed him."
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And the Jewish authorities come again,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and they almost try to persuade the men that he's still blind,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   because they didn't like this, the way it had been done and so on.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And you remember they said to him, "Look here, give God the glory."
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   "This fellow we know not from whence he is."
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   But the men answered and said,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   "Why, herein is a marvellous thing that you know not from whence he is,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   and yet he hath opened mine eyes."
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   "Now we know that God heareth not sinners,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   but if any man be a worshipper of God,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   and doeth his will, him he hereth."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   "Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind?"
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   "If this man were not of God, he could do nothing."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   That's an unanswerable argument.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And then did you remember that statement at the end of that tenth chapter of John's Gospel?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   "And our Lord went back to the place where John had been baptising at the beginning,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   and many resorted to him and said,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   'John,' they said, 'did no miracle,'"
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   because John the Baptist had never worked a miracle.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   "They said, 'John,' and we believed John, they said,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   and we liked John and we followed John.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   But this man, this man's different.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   'John did no miracle.'
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   All things that John spake of this man were true,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and many believed on him there."
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   The evidence of the miracles you see.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Well now then, there are the facts.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   The miracles are facts.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   How do they tell us anything about the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Well, they do it like this.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   They are first and foremost a fulfillment of prophecy.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Go back and read your Old Testament prophets,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and you'll find that they say this,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   that when this great Messiah, this Deliverer comes,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   he will authenticate himself by working miracles.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Read the thirty-fifth chapter of Isaiah's Gospel,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   and there you'll find they talk about the blind seeing and the lame walking and leaping.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   The Messiah is going to do this.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   That's what our Lord meant, you see.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   In the reply he sent back to John the Baptist, he said,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   "Go back and tell John again the things that you have seen and heard.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Tell him that I'm doing these things, the very things the prophets said,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   the Messiah, the coming one, was going to do.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Go and tell him that you've seen them happening."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   It is a fulfillment of prophecy.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   But not only that, their own inherent testimony was surely enough in and of itself.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Look at the number of the miracles he worked.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Look at their character.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   He can still the waves and silence, the howling gale.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   He can cleanse a leper.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   He can make the deaf hear.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   He can raise the dead.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   He's the master of the universe, and he does it in his own name.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Some men in the Old Testament had been given power to work miracles,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   but they did it in the name of God and not in their own names.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   The apostles were given power, but they did it in the name of Jesus.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Do you remember Peter and John with the men at the gate of the temple?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   They said, "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk,"
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   not in their own names.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   But here is one who does it in his own name.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   He's only a carpenter.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   He's a common man.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   But without invoking the name of God, he speaks, he commends,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   and it was done, it happened.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Who is this?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   That's the question.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   I've argued all this out with you this evening not because
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   I enjoy having an argument about miracles.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Oh, there are many who've wasted a lifetime arguing.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   God knows I've done it myself. It's a very interesting question.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   You believe in miracles, and so you have a wonderful argument about miracles,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   and you end in just arguing about miracles, and you've been clever,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and you've brought out your learning, and you've talked about science.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   God forbid that anybody should go away from here
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   thinking that I've just been interested in having an argument about miracles.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   I'm only interested in these miracles for one reason,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and that is the reason that he gave himself.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Do you see through these miracles that this is the Son of God?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Do you see that this is the only begotten Son of God?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He worked his miracles in order to call attention to himself and to who he was.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   If we don't see this, nothing is of value to us at all.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   This is the value and the purpose of the miracle.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   To bring us to see that Jesus of Nazareth was the only begotten Son of God,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   that this is no mere man, that this is God-man, God in the flesh,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   the Word of God made flesh and dwelling among us.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   But why am I interested in that? I'm interested in that for this reason.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   If this is the Son of God who has been in this world,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   what was he doing in it?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Why did he ever come?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Does he just come to give us a display of God?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   No, no, he tells us.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   He has come to complete the works which the Father has given him to do.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And if you read his great prayer at the end of his life,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   which is recorded in the seventeenth chapter of this Gospel,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   this is what you'll find him saying,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   "Father, the hour has come.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   I have glorified thee on the earth.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   What was that work?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I've already told you.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   The work that the Father sent him into this world to do
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   was the work of salvation.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Why did the Son of God come into this world?
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   He came because the whole world was lost.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   "Because there is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Because the whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Because the human race has fallen in Adam
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   and is under the wrath of God and is going to hell."
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   He came because of that.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   He came to save.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   He alone could save.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   No man could save himself.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   No man can undo his past.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   No man can keep God's law.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   No man can satisfy God in and of himself.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   The Son of God came to save.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   That's the work that God gave him.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   He gave him his people to save,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and he's come to save them.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And how does he save them?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   He saves them by honoring God's law on their behalf.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Oh, that wasn't enough.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   He came to bear their sins and their guilt in his own body.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   God, being just and holy, must forgive sin.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   He said he must.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   He said he would.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   And the punishment of sin is death and separation out of God's sight.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   So before the Son of God can save,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   he must bear our sins and bear the guilt and the punishment,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   and he did so.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   "Who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   that we, being dead to sin, should live unto righteousness,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   by whose stripes we are healed."
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   I'm not interested in arguing about miracles.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I've gone through all this that you might see this,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   that the Son of God came into the world to die for you and for your sins,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   because it's the only way whereby you can be forgiven,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   be reconciled to God and become his child,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   and escape hell and go to heaven.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   It's not a theoretical question.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   It's not an academic matter.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Your whole eternal future depends upon this.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It's not the evidence of the works, he says.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   It's greater than the evidence of John believing, accepting.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   And so I ask you as I leave you,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   have you believed the evidence?
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Do you stumble at the fact that God, when he was here in the flesh,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   worked miracles?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Well, I'd be very surprised if he didn't do so.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   When this amazing thing happens,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   don't you expect something unusual that's going to call attention to it?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And here it is.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Do you mean to tell me that the great God, the Lord of the universe,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   who created the laws of nature,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   and who has implanted the operation of the secondary causes in the cosmos,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   are you asking me to believe that God is tied in by his own laws?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   That the maker is smaller than the thing he's made?
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   That he cannot act apart from them if he doesn't choose to do so?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   That's what you're asking me to believe,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   if you ask me not to believe in the possibility of miracles?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And I cannot.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I cannot be so foolish.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   I cannot be so unscientific.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   I believe in a God who's made everything,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   and who can do anything he likes.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   He normally chooses to work in the secondary way.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   But when he sends his only begotten Son into the world,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   he wants the world to know that he's done so.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   So our Lord worked the miracle,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   and said, "If you don't believe what I'm saying,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   believe the works."
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And that's not simply that you and I should say,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   "We believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God."
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   No, no.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   But that we should go on and see this,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, was in the world,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   because it was the only way whereby even God could save us.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   He died for us.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   He died for our sin.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   His body was broken, his blood was shed,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   that you and I might be reconciled to God.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Do you believe that Jesus is the Christ,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   that Jesus is the Son of God,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   and that he died in order to taste death for you?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   If you do, I pronounce to you that you are forgiven,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   that you are saved, that your sins are blotted out,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   that you are a child of God.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   But if you don't, I tell you this evening,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   that at the day of judgment,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   his miracles will rise up against you,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   and will leave you utterly speechless.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   His person has been attested beyond any doubt or question.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   And if you don't believe in him,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   it is because you won't face the facts.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   It's because you're like these Jews,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   so prejudiced with your little opinions,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   that you won't look at facts
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   that are declaring him to be the Son of God
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   and the Savior of the world.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Learn the lesson of these foolish Jews,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   and fall down at his feet,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   and say, "Yes, I believe.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Jesus, Son of God, my Lord, my God,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   the Savior of my soul.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Amen.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   [Silence]
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   [Silence]
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   [Silence]

[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   [Silence]
