[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.560]   This week we're joined by pastor and author Tim Keller,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.160]   who has written several great books
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.260]   and adding to this collection
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.520]   is a new book on prayer coming out soon.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.480]   It's titled Prayer, Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200]   and you will want this one too.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.000]   Tim joins us again to talk about prayer
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.320]   and I have two more questions for you.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.840]   Here's question number five.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.860]   Being unhappy in the presence of God.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.020]   We talked about this on Monday,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.760]   but I wanna pick this up again.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.120]   In the book, you talk about lamenting to God,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.800]   complaining to God for the way things are going on earth.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.200]   And we know God is in control of all things.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.460]   So when and how should we express lament in prayer
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.320]   like the Psalmist?
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.960]   In other words, how do good Calvinists complain?
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.680]   This seems very hazardous.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.720]   - Well, my belief is that Calvinists do understand
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260]   that though God does,
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.520]   his decree is the final reason for everything that happens,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.720]   that there's a concurrence.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.320]   That is that God's will and our responsible choices,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.760]   that they fit together,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.400]   that God predestines things through our choices.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.960]   You don't wanna flatten things
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.720]   so that basically you don't believe that our efforts
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.340]   and our crying out and our petitions
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.400]   and our actions really don't matter.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.560]   According to the scripture, they do.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.080]   I mean, that's both Don Carson's book
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.160]   on divine sovereignty and human responsibility
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.120]   and J.F. Packer's classic,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.320]   "Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God"
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   point out the fact that those are two things
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.240]   that they don't seem to be,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.340]   they seem to be intention in our mind,
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.220]   but they're not in God's understanding of things.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.040]   But we can't flatten one for the other.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   We can't say, well, you know what,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.520]   because it's all God's will anyway,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.480]   there's no reason to cry out.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.560]   There's no reason, God's gonna do what he wants to do,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.600]   so I pray.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.440]   I mean, if you take a kind of flat Calvinism
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.360]   to say God's in control of all things,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.220]   then all prayer would be kind of useless.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.280]   So if prayer is not useless, why would laments be useless?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760]   If asking God for your daily bread isn't useless,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.400]   why would crying out and complaining
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.120]   about what's going on be useless?
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960]   It wouldn't be.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.840]   So you've gotta just keep the things together, I think.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.960]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.180]   So what does this look like for you?
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.060]   I mean, can you share with us a season in your life
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.760]   when you did complain to God in prayer?
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.720]   I mean, what did lament look like in your life?
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   - Well, I think when people die,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.360]   who it sure looks like it doesn't seem
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.680]   to help the kingdom at all.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.720]   Whenever I've, and that goes back a long way with me.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   When we don't have all the greatest leaders,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.480]   and I mean, the Christian church is not,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   doesn't have great leaders growing on trees.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.880]   And when something comes along
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.160]   and takes a leader out of commission,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.240]   either through death or something else,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.640]   I can really struggle with that and say,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.040]   God, it doesn't look like you know what you're doing.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.880]   Now that's a horrible thing to say,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.800]   but unfortunately the Psalms are filled
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.320]   with that kind of thing.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.760]   Where you say, are you, do you really, is it really?
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   So there have been places like times in my life
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.520]   in which I've wrestled and struggled and said,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.000]   I will be done and you do know best,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.080]   but honestly I'm struggling.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.400]   It doesn't seem like this makes any sense to me at all.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.960]   - Yeah, that's very helpful.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.760]   All right, question number six.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.200]   Your book is drenched in God-centered joy.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.040]   I love it.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.080]   On page 68, you write this, quote,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.680]   "Prayer is our way of entering into the happiness
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.160]   "of God himself," end quote.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.720]   Wow, okay, unpack this sentence.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.560]   Prayer is our way of entering
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.720]   into the happiness of God himself.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.040]   - Well now, this is a Desiring God podcast interview,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.880]   isn't it?
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.680]   You do work for Desiring God, right?
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.640]   And you're asking me about this?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.920]   - We don't have a corner on this.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.600]   I mean, I wanna hear how you would say it.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.280]   - Oh, well actually, when I saw the question
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.200]   which you sent me ahead of time,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.680]   I actually looked into my own book
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.120]   and of course I bring that up in the place
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.840]   where I'm talking about Jonathan Edwards' great work,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   The End For Which God Created the World.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.720]   Edwards' thesis there, which of course John Piper
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.280]   has been hammering at and promoting
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.560]   in his own Piperian way for decades,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   is that God is happy because he enjoys his own glory.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.800]   I mean, part of that's Trinitarian.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.820]   The Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.380]   are glorifying each other.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.360]   But the fact is that God is infinitely happy
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.120]   because of who he is.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.320]   He's just happy in his own glory
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.160]   and he's happy with his own glory
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.640]   when you are especially glorifying him, especially.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.640]   Probably not when you're confessing your sins so much,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.400]   but when you are adoring and glorifying him, yes,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.760]   that's when you in a sense are entering into his happiness
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.820]   'cause you're doing what he does
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.000]   and you're experiencing the same joy he has.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.080]   So that's where I talk about that.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.900]   - Beautiful.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.720]   I mean, see, it's great to hear you explain this
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.440]   in your own unique way.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.480]   And we are thrilled that your book is loaded
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.520]   with God honoring joy.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.000]   I mean, that's exactly what brings us great joy
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.020]   here at DG to see.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.560]   And listener, when this new book releases,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.920]   please make sure you read and reread chapter five
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.660]   until this point makes sense.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.840]   It's absolutely critical to understand creation
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.000]   and life and prayer and joy, everything, really.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.180]   And the book by Jonathan Edwards mentioned earlier
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.200]   can be found at desiringgod.org.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.800]   You can download it right now free of charge.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.580]   Go to the site, click on books,
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.840]   and find it by the new title that we gave it,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.680]   "God's Passion for His Glory."
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.960]   All right, six questions down, four to go,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.840]   two more tomorrow.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.720]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.320]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
