[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.440]   Ryan, a listener to the podcast who is also a pastor,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.840]   writes in with a very good question.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.080]   Pastor John, how much of the news should I read?
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.840]   I'm a pastor and a very average reader in terms of speed.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.180]   I want to stay up on the news to be a good citizen
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.340]   and an informed leader.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.160]   I want to help my congregation think biblically
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.960]   about major cultural trends and issues when relevant,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.240]   but I could spend hours every morning reading
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.560]   different online newspapers and opinion pieces,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   perhaps to the neglect of my Bible and solid theology books.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840]   So my question is not whether to read the news,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.040]   but how much of it to read.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.400]   Is there any practical advice you can give from your years
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.480]   as both a Christian and as a pastor that would help discern
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.940]   how much is too much and how little is too little?
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.000]   I do have one main piece of advice from my experience,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.320]   and it might be partly owing to my own limits
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.560]   and reading slowly and things like that,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   but more important for your people, our people,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.200]   and their ability to be Christ-exalting husbands and wives
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.240]   and community participants and civic contributors
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.360]   and vocationally effective,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.160]   more important for all those things
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   than a pastor's being widely read and culturally up to date
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.920]   on lots of fronts is the way he deals in preaching
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.240]   and leading and living with a few key social issues,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.120]   like three or four or five over his ministry, say.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.900]   And the principle I have in mind here is the same one
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.940]   that drives me in understanding the aims of education
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.560]   in school, and the principle is to impart to your people
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.360]   by the way you preach and teach and the way you think,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.040]   biblically and culturally,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.180]   you impart to them a way of thinking,
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.720]   a way of dealing with issues, a way of reading their Bible,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   a way of applying their Bible on various issues
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.520]   so that you don't bear the burden of thinking
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.700]   you have to be the expert on all the issues.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.880]   You have to model for them how they become the expert
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.520]   on the issues that are facing them most immediately.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   So we go deep on a few issues,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   and we're aware, of course, of more.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.440]   Then we preach and teach on the few
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.280]   that seem urgent and major,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.680]   and we'd be sure that, we try to be sure
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.640]   that the sermons are not mainly political.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.660]   When I say deal with the issues,
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.340]   I don't mean mainly be a politician,
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.140]   but mainly aiming to show how to think and pray
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.180]   and act from the roots of things,
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.860]   and how they're rooted in human nature
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.540]   and how they're rooted in God's purposes for the world
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.240]   and rooted in Scripture.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.780]   And then we show them those roots in Scripture
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.380]   and roots in human nature,
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.380]   and we pray that certain kinds of outcomes of behavior
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.460]   will result in a kind of righteous life in the culture.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.100]   We show them how it all relates to God
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.020]   and His ways in history and in the world
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.640]   and in this city, in this situation in particular.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.700]   You don't need to be a world expert
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.100]   to address the biblical and ethical matters
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.220]   relating to the key issues.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.040]   You need to go deep with your Bible
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.440]   and with human nature.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.860]   That's your bread and butter as a pastor,
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.940]   the Bible and human nature.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.700]   That's your expertise, and that's what your people want
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.020]   and they need from you.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.240]   Another implication of this approach would be
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.960]   that we should make clear to our people,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   we think they, not we, are to become the experts
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.880]   in the fields where they endeavor.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.900]   I think there's a lot of misunderstanding here in the church
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.360]   that if a big ethical issue comes up in their vocation,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.280]   the pastor should have the answer.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.380]   (laughs)
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.020]   How in the world?
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.540]   If they're lawyers or doctors or carpenters
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.580]   or computer programmers or salesmen,
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.860]   they bear the main responsibility
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.400]   to think through how Christianity bears
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.300]   on the nitty gritty of their vocation.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.060]   That's not the pastor's job.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.940]   I think sometimes there's a blame shifting here
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.700]   that's a cloak for laziness.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.100]   Pastors should give help for sure.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.860]   Rich biblical insights week in and week out
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.660]   from the scriptures,
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.900]   but there are hundreds of issues in every line of work,
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.220]   every vocation that the pastor does not
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.620]   and cannot know about.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.260]   He's not the expert in that vocation, that business,
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.780]   that trade.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.620]   The people in those vocations bear that responsibility.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.880]   That's what it means to be a Christian where you are.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   That's what makes those jobs a place of influence for Christ.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.820]   Christians thinking and reading and studying
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.620]   and praying and talking about what it means
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.940]   to be a Christian in this job.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.700]   There are hundreds of them,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.940]   and it's naive to think that a pastor
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.380]   can be an expert in any of them.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.980]   So I'm a little disenchanted these days
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.900]   about the way some of this is talked about.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.380]   So we empower and we encourage our people
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.000]   to become the experts on how faith and work fit together,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.060]   how the issues they're dealing with in life fit together,
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.380]   all the while the pastor is pointing and encouraging
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.440]   and pointing them to the scriptures
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.020]   and feeding their souls.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.380]   And not just jobs,
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.420]   I was thinking vocation when I said all that,
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.780]   but issues as well.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.720]   Out there in our congregation,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   people should be studying healthcare and immigration issues
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.620]   and racial profiling and police reform
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.820]   and the roots of poverty in their neighborhood and so on.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.620]   I mean, there are just dozens of social, ethical,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.380]   moral, justice issues in the world
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.120]   that our people ought to be engaged with
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.120]   and that vastly outstrip the ability of the pastor
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.740]   to be up to date on all of them.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.880]   So my point is,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.860]   whatever else a pastor reads,
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.460]   whatever else you read for focus
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.860]   and for learning and for awareness,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.740]   focus on a few key issues
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.940]   and bring God's word to bear on those.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.860]   Model in preaching and teaching and leading and living
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.500]   how a Christian thinks about those issues
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.960]   and tell them, tell the people you hope
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.100]   they can take that method,
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.180]   what they see you doing with these texts and that issue
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.060]   and apply them in other issues
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.340]   where they may run into ethical conundrums
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.000]   that the pastor hasn't thought about
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.260]   and that they haven't thought about.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.420]   And let part, I want to say to this pastor,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.420]   let part of your modeling be courage,
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.100]   courage to address hard issues.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.240]   And let part of it be wisdom
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.460]   in how to relate to those who disagree with you.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.540]   Model for your people that
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.020]   as well as the right position on an issue,
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.340]   but how to deal with people who don't take that position.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.060]   And whatever you do,
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.100]   don't try to sound like you know more than you know.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.420]   And don't try to drop clever phrases
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.900]   that make you look like you're culturally informed.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.780]   That's just fluff and it's ego.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.860]   It will entertain the superficial,
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.020]   but it will disappoint the spiritually insightful.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.720]   So admit to them your limits
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.320]   and take them as deep into God's word as you can
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.880]   on a few key issues.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.720]   - Boy, that is gonna help liberate a lot of pastors.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.980]   Well, it's time for us to break for the weekend.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.080]   And we talked about weekends on Monday, by the way,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.580]   and now you have time to catch up
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.760]   on the episodes you missed this week.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.040]   And for everything you need to know about this podcast,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   to send John Piper a question, to download our apps,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.680]   anything, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohnPiper.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   And on Monday, we return to address a question
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.080]   from a listener who battles doubts and cynicism
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.140]   that prevent her from living in the victory of Christ.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.320]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
