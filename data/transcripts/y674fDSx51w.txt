[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   Gary writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, back during Tim Keller's week of APJ episodes
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.260]   on prayer, he encouraged us to take time for meditation on the Scriptures before prayer
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.200]   so as to warm our hearts to God.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.700]   Can you give some practical advice and tips on how this looks practically for you?"
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.520]   I think the best way for me to answer this is with the help of George Mueller, because
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.280]   what he taught me years ago, many years ago, is still the way I function in the morning.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.400]   And I just think it'll be significant to let Mueller talk here with me just sticking in
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.040]   a comment here and there.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.880]   George Mueller is famous for establishing orphanages and being a great man of faith.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:05.840]   He died in 1898 and in 1841, so I think he was 36 years old when he made this life-changing
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   discovery.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.200]   Here's what he wrote, "While I was staying at Nailsworth, it pleased the Lord to teach
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.760]   me a truth irrespective of human instrumentality as far as I know.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.680]   The benefit of which I have not lost now more than 40 years since that event has passed.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.400]   The point is this.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.600]   I saw more clearly than ever that the first great and primary business to which I ought
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   to attend every day was to have a happy soul in the Lord.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.360]   The first thing to be concerned about was not how much I might serve the Lord, how much
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.320]   I might glorify the Lord, but how I might get my soul into a happy state and how my
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.620]   inner man might be nourished.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.360]   Before this time, my practice had been, at least for 10 years previously, as a habitual
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.800]   thing to give myself to prayer after having dressed in the morning."
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.560]   Now notice here, this is my insertion, that's the opposite.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120]   He had been doing for years the opposite of what Keller was suggesting.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.880]   "Now," he says, "I saw that the most important thing I had to do was to give myself to the
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.400]   reading of the Word of God and to meditation on it," like Keller suggests, "that thus
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.480]   my heart might be comforted, encouraged, warned, reproved, instructed, and that thus, whilst
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   meditating, my heart might be brought into an experiential communion with the Lord.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.000]   I might begin, therefore, to meditate on the New Testament from the beginning early in
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   the morning.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.720]   The first thing I did after asking in a few words for the Lord's blessing upon His precious
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.440]   Word," now pause, notice, "He does actually begin with prayer.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.760]   A brief, short, 'God, open your Word to me.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.840]   God help me.'"
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.400]   And this has been very important to me, because even though I know Bible reading precedes
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.960]   praying in a significant way that he's explaining, I have found it important to do my little
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.640]   I-O-U-S, "Incline my heart, O God.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   Open my heart, O God.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.480]   Unite my heart, O God.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.240]   Satisfy my heart, O God.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.840]   Else I might blunder into God's Word in a spiritually self-sufficient frame of mind
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   in which I'm not at all listening to God or hearing God."
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.720]   So just a short, I'm talking about one minute, one minute, you say to God, "I'm about to
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.160]   read your Word, and I need your help."
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.600]   And then he goes on and says, "It was to begin to meditate on the Word of God, searching,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.160]   as it were, into every verse to get blessing out of it, not for the sake of public ministry"—oh,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.520]   how important that is—"not for the sake of preaching on what I had meditated on, but
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.240]   for the sake of obtaining food for my soul."
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.120]   Now, that's crucial.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.920]   This is John Piper talking again.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.480]   That's crucial.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.600]   Meditation is not a professional thing.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's a hunger thing.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.640]   I'm here to eat.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.760]   I'm not here to stockpile arguments.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.920]   I'm not here to get a lesson.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.080]   I'm hungry for you, God.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.760]   I need to eat truth here.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.840]   That's a huge difference between the way you might read to get a sermon ready.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.120]   He goes on, "The result I have found to be almost invariably this, that after a few minutes,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.620]   my soul has been led to confession or thanksgiving or to intercession or to supplication so that
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.920]   though I did not, as it were, give myself to prayer but to meditation, yet it turned
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.960]   almost immediately more or less into prayer."
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.120]   Now here's a caution.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.800]   Don't be so mechanical in responding to Keller, which he doesn't want you to be.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.440]   Don't be so mechanical or categorized that you think, "Okay, first we do a little meditation.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   Then we pray."
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.040]   That's not the way it works.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.120]   Not for Mueller, not for me.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.760]   I'm sure not for Keller either.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.360]   First we think over the Bible, then we launch into prayer.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   No, no, no.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.280]   While you're eating for your soul, you will not be able to pray.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.680]   Things will start to happen in your soul that will cause you to cry out in confession or
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.040]   in longing or in intercession for someone or in praise.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.400]   You won't be able to put that off until 10 minutes or 20 minutes later, and that's really
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   good.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.320]   He goes on, "When thus I have been for a while making confession or intercession or supplication
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:17.120]   or have given thanks, I go on to the next verse or verses, turning all as I go into
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   prayer for myself and for others as the Word may lead to it."
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.440]   But here's a crucial point.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.480]   This is what Keller was getting at, I think.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:36.800]   But still continually keeping before me that food from my soul is the object of my meditation.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   And the result of this is that there is always a good deal of confession, good deal of thanksgiving,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.120]   supplication or intercession mingled with my meditation, and that my inner man almost
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:58.280]   invariably is even sensibly nourished and strengthened, and that by breakfast time,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.840]   with rare exceptions, I am in a peaceful, if not a happy state.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.360]   And then he ends like this, "Since God has taught me this point, it is as plain to me
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.440]   as anything that the first thing the child of God has to do in the morning is obtain
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   food for his inner man."
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.000]   I would end with one last thing.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.240]   When you're done with that meditation part, and yes, all mingled with prayer, there may
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:37.360]   be serious—I mean, there probably will be—serious prayer work yet to do, because you've got
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.220]   a list of things that never came to your mind.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.360]   Some of those things are going to happen this very day.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.800]   Some are urgent for your family or for the church or for the world that's coming down
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.560]   the line, and you didn't think of them while you were praying, and you do want to pray,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.200]   but now you're in a frame of mind that it's far better to take them to the Lord than before.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Outstanding testimony.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.840]   And Gary's question was built off of a week of podcast episodes, five episodes we recorded
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.080]   with Tim Keller on prayer.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.560]   Those are in the archive, and you can find those in episodes number 459 to 463.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.820]   459 to 463.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.920]   You'll find those episodes in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive, most easily found in
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.000]   the app for the iPhone and Android.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.400]   Well, we draw nearer and nearer to Christmas, a sweet time of year, and I hope you have
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.280]   a wonderful weekend as you plan and prepare for it.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.480]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
