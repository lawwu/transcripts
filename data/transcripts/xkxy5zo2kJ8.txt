[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   After World War II, our occupations of Japan and Germany were very successful in rooting
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.580]   out the toxic ideologies and completely transforming the society and culture, whereas, you know,
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.460]   Afghanistan and Iraq, we didn't have the same effect.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.100]   What explains why those occupations are so much more successful?
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100]   Easy.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.820]   One is a case of rebuilding institutions, and the other one is building them from scratch.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.740]   You can rebuild things rapidly, and you think of after the war, how things were bombed out
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.420]   in Western Europe, and quite rapidly, they repair buildings and things.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.180]   So both Germany and Japan had had an extensive list of functioning institutions, from local
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:49.940]   police officers, offices, to educational systems, to governments, local, provincial, et cetera,
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.900]   governments, and running the train systems and businesses, and all of this had been absolutely
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.900]   functional.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.660]   So finding the expertise to recreate that is easy.
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.100]   And of course, Germans and Japanese are going to be living there, so they are very interested
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.580]   in rebuilding.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.740]   And then what the key thing the United States then did, I know more about Japan than Germany,
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.780]   is the Japanese were hemming and hawing over what their constitution was going to be like.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.240]   And so MacArthur finally got fed up, and in one week, he got his staff to write this constitution,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.620]   and they're running around Tokyo, going to bombed-out libraries or whatever, trying to
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.980]   find examples of Western constitutions so they can pull it all together, as long before
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.540]   there's an internet where you can figure these things out, and they're figuring out what
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.460]   the constitution is going to be.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.620]   And so they cook it up over the week.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.020]   And what the Japanese think, the ones who are dealing with, they think, "Well, you know,
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.060]   the Americans are going to leave, and so we'll go along with this constitution, but once
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.420]   the Americans are out, we're going to do whatever."
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.380]   And what Prime Minister Yoshida, he was the first post-war prime minister, he said, "Well,
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.500]   we thought we could change it back."
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.060]   But he realized because of the vote, universal suffrage, allowing women to vote, and there
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.180]   had been a certain amount of land reform, he said there was no going back.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.900]   It permanently changed the balance of power in Japan.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.700]   Another feature is the Imperial Japanese Army had so disgraced itself.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.060]   Their strategy had led to the firebombing of the home islands.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.640]   Talk about a total failure.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.300]   And in Germany, the same sort of thing.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.340]   You have a universal elections and things, and it took a while to get the Western zones
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.900]   united because all the fighting with the Russians over the air zone, you eventually get two
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.700]   Germanys, etc., but then you have a very competent post-war generation, both in Japan and Germany,
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.940]   who understood full well the horrors of the war, that they'd been put through as conscripts,
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.080]   and they're really intent on rebuilding their societies, and they're the miracle generations
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.140]   in both countries.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.860]   There's no parallel for that in Afghanistan and Iraq, right?
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.740]   They've never been developed countries.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.140]   Germany and Japan were developed countries.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.740]   So and then you think, well, how long does it take to become a developed country?
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.180]   Well, some people say centuries, right?
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.620]   And then there's a whole other piece, which is the Germans and the Japanese had a real
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.860]   sense of nation, right, nationalism.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.880]   So you don't have to worry about nation building because they have a sense of national identity.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.660]   You do worry about state building, so we were doing helping with state rebuilding.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.260]   Well, in Afghanistan and Iraq, there's no sense of a nation.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.180]   They have these...
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.300]   I'm no expert on these parts of the world, but my understanding is you have these very
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.980]   different ethnic groups, many of whom want to kill each other, right?
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.900]   You're just got a civil war going on there, talking about a death ground kind of civil
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.100]   war where one's in power and just ruins the others, and the other gets in power, they
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.640]   ruin the other people.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.780]   And that's what's going on in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.460]   In addition, because their internal locations right there in the middle of continents, and
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.100]   they're surrounded by a variety of neighbors.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.620]   And if you look at those neighbors, you go, "Ooh, a bunch of those people are gonna intervene."
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.540]   And they're gonna intervene in very destabilizing ways.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.540]   Very difficult.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.540]   In Japan, it's an island.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.940]   It's hard for people to intervene.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.220]   Germany, we put a lot of money into it with having troops and getting the German army
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.220]   and other things up and running.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.940]   And this will be Ukraine's future, where they will be...
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.460]   Well, they already apparently do have the finest army in Europe.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.520]   And then they're gonna make it very highly defensible before it's all over.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.600]   And Europeans, as a group, I understand that it is absolutely in their interest to have
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.080]   an impregnable border around Ukraine.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.880]   It protects them all.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.600]   And Europe doesn't threaten Russia.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.240]   They would love it if Russia would join the party.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.680]   Join the rules-based order.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.280]   You'll make money.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680]   You'll do well.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.800]   Except the oligarchs in question, this real minority of people who run Russia and Putin,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920]   they personally won't do as well.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.640]   Well, now they're war criminals, so they're out of luck.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.140]   you
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.200]   you
