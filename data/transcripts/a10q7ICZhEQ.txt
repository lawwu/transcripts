[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Medical travel is gaining popularity as a huge way to save,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.880]   but is it actually safe, cost-effective,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.160]   and worth considering?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.200]   Today I'm talking to Joseph Woodman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960]   who literally wrote the book on the topic and says,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.680]   - What people really don't know is that healthcare
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.400]   is as good or better overseas, cross borders,
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.160]   than they can get here in the United States.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.600]   - So in this episode, we're gonna break down the facts,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.240]   from cost savings up to 65%,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.600]   to the best countries for different procedures,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.640]   how to find the right doctors, avoid common pitfalls,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.400]   and even leverage travel rewards
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.440]   to make medical travel more affordable.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, if you enjoy this episode,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.200]   please share it with a friend or leave a comment or review.

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.000]   Joseph, what do you think are some of the most common myths
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.280]   about medical travel
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.560]   and how do they actually compare to reality?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.800]   - Well, I think the main myth,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.160]   especially for people who haven't traveled overseas,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.320]   is a big misconception
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.760]   that US has the very best healthcare, and we do.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.680]   But in order to take advantage of that healthcare,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.840]   a significant number of people,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.280]   mostly at the bottom of the pyramid
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.120]   or toward the middle of the pyramid economically,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.960]   can't afford it.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.240]   We've priced ourselves out of the market.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.920]   So we don't universally have great healthcare.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.040]   We're like everywhere else.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.760]   What people really don't know is that healthcare
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.200]   is as good or better overseas, cross borders,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440]   than they can get here in the United States.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.000]   And the conception there is
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.360]   anyone who hasn't traveled overseas
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.040]   can't imagine a Four Seasons or a Hilton
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.880]   or a Denny's or a J.Crew or a Costco.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.240]   All of those exist in almost every city in the world now.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.000]   And yet people who can't conceptualize that,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.800]   who can't get their arms around that,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.880]   are not gonna be able to get their arms around
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.640]   being on an operating table or a dental treatment chair
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   in a mind-blowingly advanced hygienic environment.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.040]   They just, they can't see that happening.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.720]   What they see is a mud hut, rusty scalpels,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.520]   and weird doctors that don't know English.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.840]   - And let's talk about that last one.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.080]   As I've been preparing for this,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.120]   I've been talking about medical travel to people.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   And a lot of people have told me,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.920]   "Gosh, but there's so much nuance in medical terminology.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.960]   How are we gonna get past the language barrier?"
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   Is that something anyone even needs to worry about?
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.040]   - That's a good question.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.120]   10 years ago, yes, when my father,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.960]   who really was the inspiration for this book,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.440]   some 23 years ago, traveled to Puerto Vallarta
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.600]   for a mouthful of dental care,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   very few of the sites in Mexico
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.000]   or anywhere in the world were in English.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.160]   Very few clinics were actually consciously serving
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.480]   the international patient, all right?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.760]   He was a pioneer, he always was.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.400]   And when he mentioned it to me, I didn't know any better.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.000]   And I said, "What are you doing again?"
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.840]   And he said, "Well, you wanna come join me?"
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.960]   And that's how this whole journey started.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   But at that time, none of those websites were in English.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   He had to go and find somebody and translate them.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.200]   There are language barriers,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.760]   that's part of the screening process.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.400]   If someone refers you to a clinic
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.800]   or you find a clinic online and you contact them
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.760]   and their English isn't good, move on.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.160]   The top clinics around the world
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.000]   that we've identified in our book,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.840]   all of them speak English.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.240]   That's a prerequisite because they serve
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.000]   an English speaking patient from the United States,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.600]   from Canada, from the UK.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.480]   Those are the three big markets.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.520]   So if you have trouble with the language, move on.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.880]   You'll find a clinic that caters
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.280]   to the international patient and it speaks good English
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.400]   or they have good translators.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.760]   If you're in a foreign country like South Korea or Thailand,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.240]   where English is a little more foreign
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.560]   than let's say in Mexico.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.800]   - Backing up since not everyone listening is familiar
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   with traveling for medical procedures or diagnostics,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.160]   why should someone even be considering
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.040]   this over domestic options?
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.880]   - For U.S. outbound, and I'm assuming
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.160]   that's what we're mostly talking about,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.160]   the main reason for traveling for care for U.S. is its cost.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.080]   There's a lot of people that feel
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080]   they have a false sense of security,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.920]   that they're insured, they've got a skinny plan
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.720]   with zero premiums and then they get really sick
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.600]   and there's all these exclusions and deductibles
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.840]   and co-pays and gotchas, not to mention claims denials
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.080]   and prior authorization that they have to get through.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.480]   And now it's wide open.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   The huge driver is cost.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.200]   I have personally talked with people
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.120]   who were in for a simple colonoscopy
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   and they were insured and they got charged
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   by their insurance company, something like $2,300, $2,500.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.240]   And they thought they were covered.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.840]   They can get a colonoscopy down the road in Mexico,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.120]   Costa Rica, almost anywhere, that's an easy one.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.440]   And that's five, six, $600 with the latest technology,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.640]   the latest machines, best doctors, best drugs,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.440]   which come with colonoscopies.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.200]   - That sounds like almost 75% savings.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.680]   Is that kind of a rough average
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.160]   or how does that range compare?
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.320]   And are there certain things
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.280]   where the savings is better or worse?
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.400]   - The average savings that we tell patients they can expect,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.360]   whether it's a complex dental procedure
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.160]   or an orthopedic procedure like a new knee or a new hip,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   which is very common, or IVF, is anywhere from 40 to 65%.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.680]   So if you want to just figure roughly half,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.400]   that's a good number.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.920]   People who've been goaded by advertising or social media
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.840]   where they're advertising some cost that is 80, 85% savings,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.920]   90% savings, you really want to watch out for that.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.320]   Cost shopping is one of the biggest mistakes
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   that a medical traveler can make.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.920]   Those are the people that get into trouble
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.200]   because the clinic's got to make money too.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.640]   So they can't offer a knee procedure for $800.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   They got to pay their rent,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.260]   they got to keep their equipment up,
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.880]   they got to feed their families.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.080]   So if you aren't within that 50 to 70%,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.760]   40 to 60% cost range, you want to look out.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.080]   If it's not enough of a savings
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.280]   by the time you add your travel, your accommodations,
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.440]   your dining and all that,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.400]   unless you're tacking it on to your procedure,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.520]   then you're probably not saving enough.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.200]   - Where does that savings come from?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.240]   How is it able to be so much cheaper?
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.080]   - That's interesting.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.680]   The American Dental Association just released numbers
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.440]   on what a dental specialist makes as a salary.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   That's pretty staggering, 186, 240, $250,000 a year.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.420]   And they deserve probably every penny they get,
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.760]   the cost of living in the United States is much higher.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.400]   Cost of living in places like Mexico, Costa Rica,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.200]   Thailand, even South Korea is much, much lower.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.920]   There's not quite the emphasis on high pay.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   Doctors are perceived more as technicians
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.780]   rather than deities of some kind.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.320]   And so the cost is lower.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.080]   Another thing that people don't really talk about,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.240]   not that big a deal, but it affects things,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.360]   is that companies that produce
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.040]   a lot of that expensive equipment,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.000]   like a cyber knife for cancer,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.760]   or even proton therapy for other kinds of cancer,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.720]   or a simple MRI machine or a CTI machine,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.200]   they make deals with those countries
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   that can't afford the prices of the instrumentation.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.680]   So the hospitals and the clinics that buy those instruments
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.920]   pay a much, much lower price,
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.800]   and that gets passed down to the patient.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.600]   Also, speaking of that,
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.520]   they utilize that instrumentation.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.120]   I've seen it in clinic after clinic, hospital.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.560]   I have seen MRIs just lying around
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.040]   gathering dust in US hospitals
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.320]   because one doctor in one department
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.200]   decides he wants some sexy MRI.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.120]   Another doctor in another department says,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.020]   "I want this MRI, I want that."
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.640]   And they're not utilized.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.460]   And so the expense gets really high.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.880]   You go to a hospital like, for example,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.920]   Pomograd in Thailand.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.520]   That thing is going 24/7.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.580]   And in fact, they've got two prices.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.840]   They've got a daytime price.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.040]   It's about $450 for an MRI,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.320]   as opposed to 25 to $3,200 here in the United States,
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.240]   if you're not covered.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.440]   They have a nighttime price, which I really love,
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.680]   and it's $210.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.120]   Same thing, same equipment,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.680]   the same level of radiologists
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.080]   that is giving you the scan.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.880]   And I went there just to check it out one night,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.760]   and it was a very different world.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   And it was something that really touched me.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.620]   There were a lot of farmers, peasants,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.040]   people that weren't well off,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.040]   and $215 was a month's pay for these people.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.560]   But they offered it to them
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.140]   because they knew that they couldn't afford it.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.200]   So it was kind of a little bit of a loss leader.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.720]   The margins on it were very high.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.240]   Most of it was for pediatrics,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.680]   people trying to save their kids.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.080]   It was just kind of cool to know,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.160]   but the point being is those kinds of things add up.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.240]   Cost of living is lower in other countries.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.400]   Cost of instrumentation is lower.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.760]   But I would also say that the efficiencies are much higher
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.080]   for those clinics and hospitals
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.280]   that specifically cater to the international patient
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.640]   because they got to get them in and out of there fast
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   because a lot of them only have a weekend.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.640]   They've only got four or five days to be there.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.260]   So they have implemented strategies,
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.400]   which are really interesting.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.120]   Maybe it's too much to go into here,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   but they have implemented strategies.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.240]   If you want an implant in the United States,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.720]   it's three or four appointments
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.600]   over a span of four or five months.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.680]   That doesn't have to be that way.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.380]   Your butt's in the dental chair a lot
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.480]   over that period of time,
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   and some people might not be able to handle that.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.560]   But you're in and out in three days.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.280]   If you want like a dental implant or a root canal
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.760]   or a set of veneers.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.640]   Same thing with a hip surgery.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.520]   They've really accelerated the process
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.800]   without compromising the clinical excellence.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.120]   - Yeah, I have a friend that just came back
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.960]   from Bumgarad and said,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.880]   "The facility was just out of this world."
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.280]   He didn't know what his expectations were,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.760]   but when he left, it felt better from a facility standpoint
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.720]   than many hospitals he'd been to in the US.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.760]   One thing we didn't talk about, so maybe you can tell me,
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.560]   is how much should people be concerned
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.240]   with the quality of the doctors?
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.680]   Where are a lot of these doctors getting trained?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.640]   Is that a worry for anyone?
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.360]   - Well, it can be a worry,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.680]   and it should be certainly a concern.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.320]   I mean, your doctor is the one
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.200]   that's got his or her hands on you.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.080]   You wanna look at the quality of the clinic,
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.360]   and is it accredited?
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.480]   Does it have a lot of chops?
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.400]   Does it get great reviews?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.540]   But the bottom line is you really wanna look at that doctor.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.360]   So finding the right doctors is job number one
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.040]   once you've chosen your destination.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.120]   - And are most of the doctors
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.480]   in these kind of premier facilities
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.120]   trained locally, trained abroad?
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.320]   - It's a mix.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   You get an interesting mix of doctors.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.040]   I've talked to a fair number of them,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.000]   and a lot of them are kind of refugees
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.160]   from the US healthcare system
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.040]   because they're tired of being harassed
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.060]   by the insurance companies to keep things moving along,
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.200]   to meet quotas because the reimbursement rates
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.960]   are so low, et cetera.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.120]   So at Beaumont Grad, for example,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.140]   it's the top international medical travel hospital
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.920]   in the world.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.840]   Some 45% of their patients are from other countries,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.460]   but they have 300 American board-certified
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.320]   doctors and surgeons in that hospital.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.800]   That's an anomaly.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.000]   So if you're checking on credentials,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.640]   again, you're doing your own research.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.880]   You're referring yourself.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.120]   You have to trust that the University of Birmingham
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.080]   in the UK puts out good doctors.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.120]   On the other hand, in the United States,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.680]   one out of every seven surgeons is of Indian descent.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.600]   They were trained in India,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.080]   and they're now in the United States.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.400]   And people don't really question that
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.280]   because they have a higher level of comfort
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.880]   when they're in the United States.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.680]   If they knew this exact same doctor
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.440]   was gonna treat them in Bangalore or Chennai,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   they might run 100 miles from that.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.220]   So a lot of it's a matter of perception.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.640]   I'm not taking away from the research that's necessary,
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.760]   but to answer your question, yeah, it's a mix.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.380]   There's a lot of American-trained doctors,
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.740]   especially in Mexico and Costa Rica,
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.400]   but there's a lot of doctors that have been trained
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.920]   in perfectly good, high-quality universities.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.240]   India, Thailand, Turkey, believe it or not,
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.200]   has great training.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.640]   They're one of the biggest manufacturers
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.440]   of U.S. pharmaceuticals in the world.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.960]   Chances are, if you do a lot of pharmaceuticals,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.880]   or any at all, it's coming from either Canada,
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.080]   Turkey, or two or three other sources.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.000]   So people don't appreciate the fact
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.200]   that so much of the healthcare that we receive
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.040]   originates from foreign lands.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.100]   It just happens to end up in the United States.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.640]   - This episode is brought to you by Trust & Will.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.320]   It is so easy to overcomplicate simple tasks.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   Believe me, I know.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.640]   I love doing so much research,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   but some things don't always need to be so overcomplicated.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.160]   They end up getting put off forever,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.280]   like creating a will or trust.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.520]   So check out Trust & Will
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.880]   because they make estate planning straightforward
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.520]   and so simple you can do it from your couch.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.360]   Their platform is attorney-designed,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.680]   specific to each state,
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.320]   and most important, customized by you at every step.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.720]   I can tell you firsthand how great Trust & Will is
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.960]   because we actually used it
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.920]   to set up our estate plan years ago,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.720]   long before they were a sponsor,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.040]   because it was quick, easy,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.360]   and way less intimidating than it seems.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.520]   In a few guided steps,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.280]   we had a solid plan in place to protect our family,
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.720]   and we were able to customize it
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.680]   to match all our nuanced preferences
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.320]   about what happens to our savings,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.120]   who's gonna be the guardian for our kids,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.600]   and so much more.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.940]   I can't tell you how much peace of mind we have
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.200]   knowing that we got all of this taken care of,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.400]   and it was so easy to update online
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.420]   after we had our second child.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.680]   So let Trust & Will uncomplicate the process for you.

[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.200]   This episode is brought to you by Delete.me.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.480]   And if you prefer not to have your identity stolen
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.680]   or have your phone number, home address, or email
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.160]   showing up all over the internet,
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.640]   you really need to check out Delete.me this year.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.240]   Unfortunately, there's hundreds of data brokers online
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.360]   that are constantly sharing and selling your personal info,
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.440]   and keeping track of all of them is like playing whack-a-mole.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.320]   But fortunately, if you go to them one by one,
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.600]   you can get them to remove your data.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.120]   However, that process can take hours and hours
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.200]   to do yourself.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.560]   I know, I tried it two years ago,
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.800]   and after spending more than 10 hours
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.880]   and not even getting close to finishing,
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.920]   I gave up and started using Delete.me,
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.440]   and I haven't looked back.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.840]   Since then, I've signed up my entire family,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.420]   because Delete.me will not just find
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.920]   and remove your personal info
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.000]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.240]   they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.280]   which sadly happens all the time,
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.280]   and get that removed as well.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.220]   On average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.280]   of personal info for a customer in their first two years,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.840]   and to date, they've done over 100 million
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.820]   data removals for customers.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.560]   So if you want your personal information
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.320]   removed from the web, go to chrishutchins.com/deleteme,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.000]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.800]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/deleteme,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.720]   or click the link in the description.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.200]   Okay, so obviously, cost savings, great.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.440]   Quality can be great.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.560]   What types of procedures are things
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.280]   that people should be considering,
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.420]   or maybe not considering, medical travel for?
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.000]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.720]   And that took almost a year and a half worth of research
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.640]   when we first decided to do the book,
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.160]   because we just thought, well,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.520]   just find out the hospitals and clinics
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.880]   that are offering these procedures,
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.560]   and find the great hospitals and clinics.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.120]   But it's not that easy.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.320]   So just from a procedural standpoint,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.800]   it needs to be a procedure that doesn't take
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.640]   a massive amount of treatment over a long period of time.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.880]   So the bad news first, cancer treatments are not great,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.600]   because long, drawn out, multiple sessions.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.880]   The best types of treatments are treatments
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.200]   that have quick times, short surgery times,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.920]   and short recovery times.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.200]   And oddly, those are procedures
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.040]   that you really wouldn't think about.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.180]   Like for example, an open heart procedure,
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.340]   you would think would be not a candidate.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.340]   But from a technical, it's a pretty simple procedure,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.940]   and they want you up and walking around
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.640]   within two or three days.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.400]   And 10 days, you're gonna be able
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.420]   to get on a plane and go home.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.540]   That's a good procedure.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.920]   Not a common procedure, but it's a good one.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.540]   So bad procedures are ones that take a long time
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.400]   with multiple visits to the doctor,
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.520]   long, long recovery periods.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.780]   That's one reason I don't like bariatrics
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.840]   and weight loss programs,
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.000]   even though they're heavily advertised.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.380]   And you see a lot of that appearing in the media.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.800]   But bariatrics has got all kinds of risks
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.400]   associated with it, and at least one or two visits
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.980]   to the doctor afterwards to check on complications.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.480]   And so the better procedures, the good news is,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   about 15 or 20 procedures that are most recommended
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.440]   by doctors and most used by patients.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.360]   So almost all dental procedures with the caveat
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.520]   that implants, as you may know,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.280]   sometimes take a second visit.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   That's just the nature of an implant.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   They put the abutment in,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.000]   your bone has to go around the abutment,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.840]   then you have to come back.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.640]   That's true in the United States
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.940]   and anywhere else in the globe.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.640]   But it's got short recovery periods,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.120]   and you go home after your first treatment,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.680]   you come back three months later,
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   you go home after your second treatment.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.200]   Orthopedics is good.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.640]   The surgeries have improved to the point
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   where they want you up and walking around
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.280]   almost the next day.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.120]   - Wow.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.240]   - IVF is good if you're willing to travel
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.160]   a couple of times, because not every IVF is successful.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.540]   So you get a failure rate.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.160]   So you might have to go back a couple of times.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.200]   So somebody from New York isn't gonna wanna go to Bangkok
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.640]   for IVF, it's expensive to travel.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   - One follow-up on that.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.080]   My wife happened to go through IVF,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.480]   and part of the process was egg retrieval, implantation,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.680]   but also there were a lot of drugs,
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.920]   she had to administer shots.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.040]   With some of these treatments that might require
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.960]   medication, prescriptions,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   do they provide all of those abroad?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.600]   Do they work with your doctor at home
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.060]   to kind of help get all the medications you need?
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.620]   I know some of those medications
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.120]   often need to be refrigerated,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.760]   so maybe you couldn't take home a full supply
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.800]   from your trip to Thailand.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.120]   How does a lot of that work?
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.960]   - It's a good question.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.360]   The prescriptions that I've had written for me,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.700]   as long as they're in English,
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.400]   and they're on a doctor's stationery,
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.040]   can be filled in the United States.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   If it's not in that language,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.280]   you wanna make sure that you've gone
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.840]   to a really great hospital that has their own pharmacy.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.680]   Most of these big hospitals have their own pharmacies,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.120]   and they don't mess around with the quality of prescriptions.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.880]   So they're a lot like the US,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   they've got a lot of screening for counterfeit prescriptions
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.200]   for prescriptions made by poor manufacturers.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.000]   And what you wanna do is also focus on the brand name,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.280]   don't get the generic.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.120]   - Okay.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.840]   - Unless it's just prohibitively expensive.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.580]   - So it sounds like for the prescriptions you might need
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.760]   that you can get at the time of the procedure,
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.840]   you can get them there.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.600]   And if you need them later,
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.160]   they can actually write prescriptions.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.760]   Do doctors ever do follow-ups virtually?
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   - Not so much.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.320]   A lot of people who are trying to save money
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.380]   on medical travel are ashamed to talk to their specialist,
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.800]   or they don't wanna let them know that they're traveling.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.480]   It's really important to give your doctor a heads up.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.540]   And there's no shame in saying, "Doc, I can't afford you.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.840]   "And I found a great clinic, it's JCI accredited.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.240]   "This is where I wanna go."
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.040]   It may or may not be that your doctor and your destination
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.320]   and your foreign country would follow up.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.140]   But the fact that you've given your doc notice,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.000]   and you've brought back all of your paperwork,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.960]   that's another big mistake people make
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.160]   is they toss their paperwork,
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   they leave it in the hotel room.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.440]   You gotta bring back your screening, your blood tests,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.240]   your consultation notes, all of that.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.200]   And then a doc is gonna be able to pick up
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.160]   where your other doc left off if a complication develops,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.200]   or if they need to go in and do something else
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.000]   or have some follow-up.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.520]   - Yeah, the friend of mine who went to Bumrungrad
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.360]   in Thailand told me that the hospital has an app
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.940]   that has all of your medical records there.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.140]   And he was just amazed when he came home.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.420]   He took his father as well.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.500]   And the access to the records of everything that happened,
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.220]   he thought were better than the access
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.220]   that he gets going to see a doctor in the US.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.460]   - Oh, it's so frustrating.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.140]   I'm at an age where I'm seeing a doctor
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.740]   a little more these days.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.460]   And even at Duke Medical, which is one of the top,
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.640]   it was voted in Time Magazine many years ago
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.980]   the top medical facility in the United States.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.380]   And they still haven't got
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.740]   your universal healthcare record together.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.860]   They still, every time I come in,
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.460]   they have to ask me a series of questions,
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.700]   including, do you have black lung disease?
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.740]   No, I have not been in a coal mine
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.380]   in the last two weeks since I saw it,
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.620]   'cause the technology for universal healthcare records
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.980]   is 20 years old.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.420]   And yet, it just isn't centralized.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.060]   I know they know everything about you,
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.340]   they just aren't making it available to the consumer
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.100]   and in many cases to the institution.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.600]   The reasons for that are a mystery to me,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.360]   but it is true that they have better healthcare records
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.340]   and a better bead on your health.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.880]   And the notes, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.660]   in other institutions that I've been to overseas.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.500]   - Are there any treatments that someone listening
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.220]   might think, oh, wow, that seems like an obvious candidate
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.180]   for medical travel, but for some reason
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.460]   that maybe isn't obvious is actually
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.140]   really not a good candidate?
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.180]   - You mentioned before, what's the main reason
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.900]   people travel for care?
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.700]   And I said, cost, cost, and cost.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.940]   And that is about 95% of it.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.640]   But a lot of people travel
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.620]   because they wanna get access to care
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.660]   that isn't allowed in the United States.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.680]   Like for example, stem cell treatments, right?
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.300]   So that's one that is dicey
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.100]   and that people need to really watch out for
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.660]   because stem cell is good for some joint stuff,
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.780]   but it's not a cure-all
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.660]   and it doesn't do a whole lot for cancer.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.220]   So you wanna watch out
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.820]   for some of those experimental treatments
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.820]   that look like they might be a good deal
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.100]   or it might be a good thing to go for,
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.740]   or it's heavily advertised.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.060]   So stem cell treatments are heavily advertised.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.380]   If you search for stem cell Mexico,
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.340]   stem cell Thailand, stem cell Singapore,
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.700]   which is a lot of legitimate stem cell work,
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.060]   mostly for orthopedics, you're gonna get a lot of ads.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.900]   You're gonna get a lot of sponsored stuff.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.220]   And those are people that are trying to lure Americans
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.360]   and UK people and other folks to an experimental treatment
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.340]   that may or may not be a good idea.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.660]   It's another one that's got a lot of prep work
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.500]   has to be done.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.060]   There's a lot of post-analysis that has to be done
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.100]   that often can't be done remotely.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.740]   So yeah, there are treatments like that,
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.340]   but the top treatments
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.260]   and the treatments that are the most sought after
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.460]   are the ones that are elective
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.660]   that aren't covered by insurance anyway.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.660]   So dentistry, cosmetic surgery, a lot of orthopedics,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.380]   especially if you're pre-Medicare
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.820]   and your insurance company
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.260]   is giving you trouble covering it, right?
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.560]   IVF for younger folks, that's really expensive.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.040]   It's 40, 50 and $60,000 and up.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.940]   You can get that in a JCI accredited clinic in Barbados.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.560]   And they've got actually statistics that show
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.660]   that the less stress you're under
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.140]   when you undergo an IVF treatment,
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.460]   the higher your success rates.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.340]   And why not chill out on a beach?
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.680]   It's not a surgery and contemplate having a baby.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.580]   And this is one of the few JCI accredited
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.500]   fertility clinics in the world.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.700]   You know, it's a plane flight away.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.900]   - Now you mentioned JCI a bunch of times.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.420]   What is JCI accreditation mean
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.080]   and how important is that when doing research?
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.700]   - Well, short answer to your first question is
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.420]   JCI stands for Joint Commission International.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.620]   The Joint Commission is an accreditation agency
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.800]   that puts their seal of approval
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.900]   on hospitals throughout the United States.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.300]   And it's so important that if you're a hospital
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.000]   that's trying to accept Medicare or Medicaid,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.540]   you have to be JC accredited.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.820]   About 25 years ago, hospitals began to export
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.940]   some of their services like Cleveland Clinic
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.900]   had plans to build in Abu Dhabi.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.580]   John Hopkins went to Singapore
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.980]   and established a cancer institute.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.580]   And JC, Joint Commission saw the writing on the wall
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.900]   and said, "Oh, we better go international."
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.340]   And what they did was they applied all the principles
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.500]   and all of the criteria.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.580]   They have 3000 criteria that a hospital has to meet
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.340]   in order to be JCI accredited.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.260]   And full survey, they do a full scan
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.180]   of the hospital physically.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.220]   And then they accredit the hospital
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.660]   and survey it once every three years.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.180]   So it's kind of a gold standard.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.100]   Just to let you know, when we started researching the book,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.280]   there were 27 JCI hospitals around the world.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.940]   Today, there are over a thousand.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.860]   So that gives you an idea of how much this industry
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.340]   has grown and how the quality of healthcare
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.740]   has improved in countries that used to be considered
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.220]   third world countries or industrializing nations.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.220]   And their healthcare has improved dramatically.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.740]   And they've got state-of-the-art equipment,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.100]   state-of-the-art doctors,
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.620]   state-of-the-art strategies and procedures
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.120]   that we don't often have in the United States.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.880]   That said, just because a hospital or clinic
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.300]   is not JCI accredited,
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.000]   doesn't mean it's not a great hospital.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.180]   So you have to look for other sources of accreditation,
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.140]   like are they members of the Ministry of Health,
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.180]   is it as a Ministry of Health of Malaysia
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.580]   or Thailand or Mexico?
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.180]   Are they certified?
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.280]   Are they registered as a Ministry of Health?
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.260]   What's their ratings?
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.600]   That's why medical travel just isn't for everybody.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.860]   It's for people that can do their own research
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.260]   and have the confidence that they can land on a hospital
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.760]   or a clinic that they believe is a quality clinic.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.780]   And a lot of people don't really do research.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.300]   They can't even research their own healthcare
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.880]   here in the United States
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.020]   and figure out whether a doctor is a good doctor.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.940]   Many of them just blindly take the referral
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.020]   from their general practitioner,
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.520]   walk into the specialist's office,
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.220]   don't ask anything about the background
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.940]   and lay down on the operating table.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.660]   I don't think that's a good idea in the US
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.820]   and I certainly don't think it's a good idea abroad.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.900]   - Funny enough, this reminds me of something
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.460]   related to airline points and miles.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.340]   And that is that to get the most value
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.080]   from your credit card or airline points,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.260]   you really need to find the right flights
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.420]   on the right dates and you can make those points
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.420]   worth sometimes five, 10 times as much as they would be
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.680]   if you just log in and book the flight you were looking for.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.700]   And I know a lot of people
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.660]   that just don't have the time to do that,
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.000]   but the savings is so great that there's a whole industry
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.460]   of what's called award booking services
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.620]   where you might pay them $200 and tell them,
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.580]   "Here's how many points I have with this bank
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.580]   "and this credit card."
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.120]   And they'll go out and find you the flight to Japan
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.580]   that might save you $5,000.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.620]   And so does something like that exist in this world
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.820]   where if I know that I have a treatment
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.900]   or a surgery that's $20,000,
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.540]   I know I can save a significant sum of money.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.160]   Are there people I could hire with some of that savings
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.860]   to help me through this process and say,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.940]   "Hey, I need a hip replacement.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.660]   "It's not gonna be covered.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.020]   "Can you help me find a good facility overseas
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.180]   "to make this easier?"
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.580]   - Yes, there are medical travel agencies
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.580]   that help patients in need identify the best destination,
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.060]   the best hospitals, the best clinics.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.460]   It's online, it's transactional,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.260]   but yes, it's kind of a mom and pop business
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.060]   that really is often started by well-meaning patients
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.100]   that has a relationship with a hospital.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.100]   There are very few agents that have a full-blown network
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.060]   that you can choose from
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.780]   and that you can contact patient services representative
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.660]   and get a little bit of help.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.060]   We've worked closely in the past
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.700]   with a group called Medical Departures.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.980]   They started out as a dental departures.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.060]   Actually, it was a former Expedia executive
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.900]   that decided he was going to establish
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.660]   TripAdvisor for medical tourism.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.020]   - Okay.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.420]   - Hired his family off to Mexico, found 200 clinics,
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.940]   started to do really well.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.420]   They were really good quality clinics,
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.940]   and then the cartels kind of got in the way,
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.940]   and he fled to Thailand
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.500]   thinking everything was gonna crash.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.700]   His business did not crash.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.460]   Mexico still is the largest go-to destination
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.500]   for Americans seeking health care.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.460]   He went off to Thailand to serve the Australia,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:20.460]   Oceania, Southeast Asia market and did really well there,
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.700]   and they've got a network of around 3,000 clinics
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.220]   and some 27 countries,
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.620]   and they're probably the largest
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.140]   medical travel agency serving Americans.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.020]   There's a lot of agencies like Medigo.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.340]   There's another one in Ireland.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.500]   It's called what clinic?
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.900]   And they also serve patients who are in need,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.140]   don't trust themselves enough to do their own research.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.580]   These agencies do the research, vet the clinics,
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.420]   vet the doctors, keep the profiles up to date,
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.340]   make sure the certifications are up to date,
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.580]   and recommend clinics and doctors.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.420]   - Okay.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.820]   - And they often work by taking a commission
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.220]   out of the treatment, so usually the services are free.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.220]   - And so if someone listening thinks,
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.060]   "Gosh, I have the procedure,"
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.020]   whether it's any of the ones you listed
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.060]   that's a good candidate for this,
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.140]   what's kind of a framework for how they might think
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.060]   about the steps between do I wanna do this
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.620]   to I've found the facility and I'm going?
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.460]   What's the first thing someone should do?
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.220]   - It really depends on the patient.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.020]   It's individual, but for me,
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.060]   the first thing you wanna do is figure out
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.100]   which destination is best for your treatment.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.940]   Some destinations are better
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.180]   for some treatments than others.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.860]   Oddly enough, India is great
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.620]   for hips and knees orthopedics.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.700]   But in general, you wanna choose your destination first.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.940]   And some people have a preference.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.020]   They might have a family member in Istanbul.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.660]   They might have a friend.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.460]   They might wanna travel to a particular destination
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.060]   for a procedure that doesn't demand
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.820]   more than eight or nine days of recovery,
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.420]   and they'd wanna recover in that particular country.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.180]   So choose the destination first.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.540]   The destinations that we outlined
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.660]   in "Patients Beyond Borders,"
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.100]   there's some 15 or 20 of them.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.100]   Took us a year and a half to eliminate
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.460]   a lot of the destinations that might have good healthcare,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.460]   but bad travel ability.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.140]   Can't get there in less than two hops.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.900]   So it's complex, but if you do your research,
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.820]   you're naturally gonna find those destinations
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.100]   from those service companies
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.380]   or from a book like "Patients Beyond Borders,"
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.460]   and that'll be a screen right there.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.260]   We're not gonna recommend Cyprus.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.020]   It's too hard to get to.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.540]   They've got great healthcare, too hard to get to.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.140]   We're not gonna recommend the Philippines.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.300]   The quality of care isn't great,
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.800]   even though they've got a lot of care.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.780]   That said, if you're looking for a hair transplant,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.820]   you wanna look at Turkey,
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.300]   because they're the top dog for hair transplants
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.540]   for one reason or another.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.180]   If you're looking for dental work,
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.620]   there's plenty of great dental work
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.620]   along the border in Mexico or in Cancun or in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.580]   Or in Mexico City.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.340]   And at least 100 clinics that are just top quality
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.420]   can match any clinic in the United States.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.100]   - Mexico is to the US and how cheap it is to travel there,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.360]   even some parts of Central America.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.620]   Are there other procedures like dental
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.740]   that are worth looking closer to home early on
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.100]   that aren't as far away as Thailand and Turkey?
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.740]   - Well, money's always gonna be an issue.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.860]   So the further away a destination is,
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.980]   the more it's gonna cost in travel.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.760]   Now that might be offset by Thailand,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.860]   which once you get there is incredibly inexpensive.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.260]   But there are a lot of other issues.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.100]   So if you're morbidly obese
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.320]   and you're going in for a hip procedure,
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.220]   it's a little tougher to get on a plane and fly out there.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.260]   So we think of medical travel in concentric circles
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.260]   of four-hour time slots around the globe.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.580]   And so generally, as a rule of thumb,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.740]   if you have to travel more than four hours for your care,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.220]   you wanna make sure that you're doing it
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.740]   for the right reasons.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.940]   So for the United States, it's Mexico,
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.280]   Costa Rica, and Colombia are the best destinations.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.540]   So it may not be sexy to talk about,
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.980]   but some 80% of outbound US travel
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.020]   is in fact for complex dental care.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.580]   Wherever you go, that's the number.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.940]   And some 70 or 80% of that is to Mexico.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.420]   So Mexico, and I know the media loves to talk about,
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.080]   you know, heroic heart procedures and cancer treatments
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.440]   that saves the life of a medical travel,
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.820]   but that's not really the reality.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.540]   It's usually pretty mundane,
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.700]   but it saves people their lives in some cases.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.860]   There was a guy in Iowa
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.940]   that was literally on the verge of selling his farm.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.740]   And he ended up getting a hip procedure
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.580]   in India, in Chennai, and it was a great success.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.380]   And he saved a boatload of money.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.060]   As far as proximity goes, yeah,
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:59.060]   Mexico for dental, for orthopedics,
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:04.060]   for some IVF, IVF is coming up in Mexico,
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.380]   for wellness checks.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.980]   They're beginning to offer a lot of wellness checks.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.140]   Simple scans, an MRI, a CT.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:16.580]   When I blew my shoulder out and I was pre-Medicare,
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.300]   I couldn't get the price of an MRI
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.060]   and they didn't wanna authorize it.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.220]   I can't remember exactly what the circumstances,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.740]   but Duke wasn't going to write the code
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.140]   to authorize that MRI.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.340]   And so I nosed around,
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.300]   finally went into the accounting department
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.940]   and some dusty accountant said,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.320]   ah, he's flipping through receipts.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.860]   2,500, 31, I don't know, it's about $3,200
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.940]   for an MRI, out of pocket.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.020]   I ended up at Bumengrad and it was $416.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.980]   So it was worth the trip to Thailand.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.020]   Now I'm in the unusual position of doing a lot of travel.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.500]   A lot of people don't have that luxury,
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.740]   so it's gonna be more important for them
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.900]   to wanna look at places closer to home
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.060]   and see if that procedure is offered in a Mexico
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.060]   or a Costa Rica or a Colombia.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.180]   Colombia has great heart work.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.060]   Costa Rica has two or three JCI accredited hospitals
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.980]   in San Jose and Escazú.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.940]   Escazú, there's a hospital, CIMA, C-I-M-A,
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.460]   that is JCI accredited.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.380]   They're in a town, a suburb of San Jose,
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.300]   which is kind of seedy,
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.580]   but the suburb looks like any American town.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.700]   It's got a Ritz Carlton right next to it
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.740]   and right next to that is a Hampton Inn.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.900]   So you can go budget, you can go luxury
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.260]   and end up at a hospital that's a multi-specialty hospital
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.380]   and get almost any kind of normal procedure
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.620]   that you're looking for.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.300]   - And for your MRI example, is this,
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.200]   you mentioned you should tell your doctors at home
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.580]   what's happening, but is this something
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.340]   you could plan with them in advance?
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.220]   One of the procedures that I looked at
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.660]   when I got a positive calcium score
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.780]   was to get a CT angiogram
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.900]   and somehow insurance covered it,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.680]   but even though I don't think they were supposed to,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.080]   which is not a typical situation,
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.320]   but it was gonna be thousands of dollars.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.700]   Could I work with my doctor and say,
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.860]   hey, could I go get this somewhere else
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.780]   where it's $400 and have the results sent over to you
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.660]   and kind of do it in partnership?
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.700]   Have you seen doctors be receptive
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.960]   to doing the imaging work in other countries
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.540]   where the MRIs or the CT scans are a lot less expensive?
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.140]   - That's a good question.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.140]   I don't know that doctors would have predispositions
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.740]   about going overseas.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.820]   They haven't been overseas themselves a lot of times.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.680]   They're not big travelers sometimes,
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.100]   and so they cast a jaundiced eye
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.780]   on medical tourism in general.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.940]   Also, they feel somewhat competitive.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.000]   It's one of the reasons why cosmetic surgery costs
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.420]   in the United States have been held down
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.540]   because so many people in the 20th century
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.740]   traveled for cosmetic surgery work
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.240]   to the point where it was actually cutting in
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.460]   to the care that was being offered in the United States.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.900]   What I would say, though, for something like a scan,
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.380]   like an MRI or a CT, just go ahead and get it.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.380]   They're all the same.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.260]   They have exactly the same results.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.940]   They're recorded by the same machines.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.020]   Just make them make sure they're in English
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.340]   and then bring the results home,
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.060]   which is exactly what I did
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.820]   when I went to Bumgarad with my MRI.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.300]   - And you had no issue with your doctor saying,
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.420]   "Here are my results," and they were like,
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.180]   "Oh, they look just like the results I would get here."
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.020]   - Yeah, exactly, yeah,
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.420]   and they're done by qualified radiologists, et cetera,
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.700]   so the doctor doesn't have much to argue with there,
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.780]   and that's why you wanna form your doctor first
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.180]   before you leave because if you do have complications
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.020]   when you come back, your doc at least has been informed,
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.620]   and they can dig in using your paperwork
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.780]   or your X-rays, your blood work,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.340]   all the aftercare stuff, all the notes,
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.940]   and then pick up where the doctor left off.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.300]   After all, healthcare is becoming
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.540]   more and more plug and play.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.580]   I know a lot of people that in later stage cancer,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.380]   they wanna take their wives to Israel
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.820]   'cause they've never been to Israel
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.380]   or never been to Turkey,
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.180]   and they can get their chemo there if they schedule it,
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.340]   and they got the right prescription for chemo.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.940]   They can just drop into the hospital, arrange it,
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.420]   get their chemo or their radiation done in a foreign country.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.940]   The reason we don't like cancer is because
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.340]   if you've adopted that country for all of your cancer care,
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.620]   you're gonna end up going back all the time
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.420]   for what, six, eight, 10 treatments,
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.420]   whatever the chemo prescription is,
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.660]   whatever the regimen is.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.860]   But healthcare has become more plug and play.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.340]   So for scans, if you have an executive checkup,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.060]   like Malaysia is really great
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.140]   with executive medical checkups.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.540]   South Korea is really good.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.620]   So if you brought that back in English,
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.100]   that should satisfy any specialist or any GP.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.980]   - Yeah, the procedure that the friend of mine
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.260]   who went to Bumrungrad got
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.420]   was actually an executive checkup for himself and his father.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.220]   And this actually became the subject
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.540]   of a dinner conversation last night
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.220]   because my in-laws are here,
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.420]   and they just never even heard of this idea
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.460]   of going to get an executive physical.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.220]   And we talked a lot about
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.420]   concierge medical practices in the U.S.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.420]   where you might spend 10, 15, $20,000 a year
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.340]   and have a doctor who's going to do all the diagnostics.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.460]   They're gonna do all the blood work,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.540]   all the ultrasound, the MRI, all the scans,
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.580]   and sit down for hours with you
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.020]   to talk about all the results
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.740]   to make sure that there's not anything important
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.620]   to follow up on.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.180]   For some people, they can afford that.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.980]   For some people, there are enough new companies,
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.100]   and I'm actually gonna probably do an episode on them,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.340]   where you could just go do the blood work, right?
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.020]   You could spend $300 to $700
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.860]   and get a bunch of biomarkers tested,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.820]   or you can schedule a DEXA scan or a VO2 max.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.460]   But I was looking at this list,
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.540]   and for hundreds of dollars, less than $1,000,
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.860]   you can get the full suite of executive physical things,
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.380]   stress tests, EKGs, ultrasounds, CT scans,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.100]   and all the blood tests,
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.460]   you know, urine tests, stool tests,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.340]   all of it in a day
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.220]   with a couple hours with doctors
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.580]   to be able to talk about the results for under $1,000.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.980]   And my father-in-law was like,
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.300]   "When are we going to Thailand?"
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.380]   This is amazing.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.300]   And the friend of mine who went
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.780]   is now gonna just make it part of his annual thing.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.820]   Every year, he's gonna fly to Thailand
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.660]   to go to this hospital.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.140]   They've got all his records,
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.540]   and he can get everything checked up and follow up.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.340]   And yes, you can do that in the U.S.,
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.660]   either by piecing it together yourself
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.900]   or spending probably tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.820]   But viewing this not just from the lens of I need treatment,
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.260]   but I wanna be preventative with my healthcare.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.940]   I wanna diagnose, you know,
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.460]   anything that I need to be worried about.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.500]   I wanna understand any of my deficiencies.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.260]   Even I, you know, until researching this episode
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.820]   and talking with a friend of mine, didn't realize
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.100]   that this is not just an option for I need to replace a hip,
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.980]   I need to do IVF, I need to do this thing,
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.460]   but I just wanna stay ahead of my health.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.260]   And it costs a fraction of what it would cost
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.860]   to do those things here.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.140]   And so, yes, it's great that there are a bunch
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.620]   of new companies launching a lot of these tests
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.900]   to make it cheaper in the U.S.,
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.220]   but it's not even close.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.100]   A full blood panel with a lot of companies in the U.S.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.780]   is not that different from an entire day onsite
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.860]   with a doctor who focuses on interpreting these results
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.380]   and thinking about longevity
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.860]   and a bunch of other much more expensive tests.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.460]   So that's one, I'm glad you re-brought up
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.620]   executive physicals, 'cause I'm not sure
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.340]   if everyone knows what the term executive physical is,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.900]   but it's really a lot more than height, weight,
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.500]   cholesterol panel, and blood panel.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.980]   It's very thorough.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.940]   - Yeah, kind of what you get in the United States.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.900]   When I was in South Korea getting a physical,
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.980]   I finally had to stop when they wanted to do
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.700]   an endoscopy and a colonoscopy.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.740]   I was like, "Enough, enough.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.540]   "I've had the CT, I've had the MRI."
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.660]   I think it was around $1,100 for the whole thing.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.220]   - Yeah. - It was crazy low.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.180]   And again, top hospitals, super clean,
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.220]   all the right equipment.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.060]   Those are the kinds of things
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.500]   that you almost have to see to believe.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.700]   - Yeah, and so now I'm a promoter for a hospital
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.940]   I have no affiliation with,
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.420]   and I'm sure there are other hospitals
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.660]   that do just as great a job.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.100]   You did it in South Korea.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.180]   So that's just something I'll encourage people
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.860]   to take a look at if they wanna be more proactive
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.420]   about their health and don't wanna spend the cost it takes
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.260]   to be that proactive in the US.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.060]   So that's really helpful.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.780]   - This episode is brought to you by Green Chef.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.660]   I'm excited to kick this year off right.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.060]   And if you wanna start creating better eating habits
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.260]   that last, you should be looking at Green Chef
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.580]   because they make it easy.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.940]   With so many dietician developed recipes
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.820]   that feature fresh organic produce
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.540]   and quality whole foods delivered to your door each week.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.060]   We've been cooking with Green Chef for almost two years.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.340]   We absolutely love it.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.820]   It's like a cheat code for eating healthy and clean
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.460]   because ingredients are pre-portioned,
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.900]   sauces are pre-made,
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.340]   which means there's less prep and less mess
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.460]   and more time to eat a delicious meal.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.500]   Even better, they make it easy to eat right
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.580]   for your lifestyle or dietary needs,
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.340]   whether that's Mediterranean, keto,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.580]   plant-based, gluten-free and more.
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.060]   And if you wanna stay on track during your busiest days,
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.700]   they have salads that are ready in five minutes or less,
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.900]   ready to blend smoothies
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.740]   and grab and go protein packed breakfasts.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.580]   So go to allthehacks.com/greenchef
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.700]   and use the code ALLTHEHACKSFREE
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.540]   to get started with free salads for two months,
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.980]   plus 50% off your first box.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.700]   That's code ALLTHEHACKSFREE
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.740]   at allthehacks.com/greenchef
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.700]   to get 50% off your first box,
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.340]   plus two months of salads for free.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.780]   This episode is brought to you by NetSuite.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.740]   What does the future hold for business?
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.660]   Ask nine experts and you'll get 10 answers.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.100]   Bull market, bear market, inflation up or down,
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.300]   it would be amazing if we had a crystal ball.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.180]   But until then, over 38,000 businesses
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.340]   have future-proofed their business with NetSuite by Oracle,
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.420]   the number one cloud ERP,
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.740]   bringing accounting, financial management, inventory, HR,
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.900]   all into one fluid platform.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.780]   With one unified business management suite,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.340]   there is one source of truth,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.500]   giving you the visibility and control you need
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.020]   to make quick decisions.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.740]   And when you're closing the books in days, not weeks,
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.820]   you're spending less time looking backwards
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.500]   and more time planning for the future with actionable data,
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.100]   which is exactly what I'd want as a CEO.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.220]   Speaking of opportunity,
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.340]   you can download the NetSuite CFO's guide
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.300]   to AI and machine learning at chrishutchins.com/netsuite.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.460]   The guide is free.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.900]   You can go to chrishutchins.com/netsuite
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.620]   or click the link in the description.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.940]   Different topic, but something we didn't talk on
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:18.780]   in that checklist.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.460]   You said, start with where you're gonna go.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.380]   Do some research, find the right facility.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.140]   We talked about accreditation.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.860]   You know, your book has a ton of resources.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.660]   In fact, the reason we're talking
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.620]   is because I tried to find a person
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.340]   who's researched more than one destination,
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.220]   and you were clearly the standout.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.740]   Everyone else I looked for was like,
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.340]   I know a lot about Turkey or Thailand or a region.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.460]   What do you suggest people look for
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.500]   when they're picking the actual doctor
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.060]   they would work with overseas?
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.180]   We outline that in detail in the book,
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.300]   but in short, you look for doctors
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.940]   that have been board-certified in their country.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.300]   You look for doctors that have been registered
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.380]   in their home country.
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.220]   You know, if you can find an American board-certified doctor
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.820]   or surgeon, all the better.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.740]   Reviews are becoming really important.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.380]   I know they get gamed, and sooner or later,
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.660]   Google's gonna start gaming their reviews,
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.300]   but for now, they're pretty straight up.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.620]   If you look up a doctor or you look up a clinic,
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.020]   the reviews are pretty straight up,
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.580]   and they haven't been tampered with,
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.100]   and reviews are becoming more and more important
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.300]   in the healthcare community,
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.380]   just like they're important on Amazon
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.620]   or TripAdvisor or Airbnb or whatever.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.620]   Healthcare is becoming commoditized in that way,
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.780]   and I put a lot of weight on reviews
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.620]   when I research clinics and hospitals.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.900]   I put a weight on the number of reviews
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.020]   and, of course, the rating.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.500]   If it's 20 reviews, not so much.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   If it's 1,000 reviews with a 4.6 or 4.7 rating, that's great.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.700]   - One thing we didn't talk about,
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.380]   how far in advance do people need to plan
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.980]   for a lot of medical travel?
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.700]   I know in the U.S., I waited three, four months
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.900]   to see a cardiologist, so is this something
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.020]   that you plan incredibly long out,
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.900]   or can you plan it as late as I'm in Thailand,
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.580]   right now, listening to this podcast,
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.100]   maybe I should go get this executive physical tomorrow?
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.460]   - That might be a stretch, but you wouldn't have
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.080]   to wait more than a couple or three days,
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.580]   and often, they will find a way to fit you in.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.260]   How they do that, I don't really know,
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.440]   because they don't sacrifice the quality,
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.420]   so it's kind of a bifurcated question.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.340]   The wait times are much, much shorter
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.100]   in clinics and hospitals that serve international patients,
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.340]   because they know that they have to do things very rapidly.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.440]   However, as far as your planning goes,
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.140]   you should be planning your trip four to six months out,
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.800]   so that you can get the very best plane fares,
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.660]   you can get the very best deals on your hotel.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.860]   You wanna get a hotel that's close to your hospitals,
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:46.740]   'cause you don't wanna get caught
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.340]   in some of the amazing, snarly traffic
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.860]   in Bangkok, or Kuala Lumpur, or even in Cancun.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.880]   So, you wanna do your actual planning,
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.500]   once you've decided on a doctor or a facility, further out.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.980]   That said, if you're in-country,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.020]   and you wanna go to a top-quality dentist,
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.660]   they can almost always schedule the next day,
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.180]   these people work 24/7, they're maniacs.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.860]   It's not a good idea to have your son meet you in Bangkok,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.020]   when he's like 22 years old.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.820]   But, he gets off the plane,
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.820]   and I said, "Well, let's go get a massage."
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:26.020]   And he said, "You know, Dan, I thought we got,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:30.140]   "you had really good, cheap healthcare here in Bangkok."
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.540]   And I said, "Yeah, you do, you wanna go to a dentist?"
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.780]   And he said, "Yeah, I've got a toothache."
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.280]   So, we scheduled the next day,
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   and really high-quality clinic in a gorgeous shopping mall,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.040]   four stories of shopping,
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.180]   across from a foreign car company.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.160]   I don't know how they got those cars on the fourth floor,
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.920]   Lamborghinis and Bugattis, and all BMWs,
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.840]   and all kinds of stuff.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.700]   And the clinic was right across from that.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.720]   And he got his teeth done, and when he was walking out,
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.660]   he was begging the dentist,
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.880]   when he got the bill, to go do more work.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.440]   And the guy says, "You don't need more work,
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.440]   "I'm not gonna do more work on you."
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.540]   But the whole bill was like $180 for all kinds of work.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:17.820]   So, yeah, the wait times can be very, very, very short
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.000]   for a lot of the traditional stuff.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   If you need a heart procedure,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.640]   yeah, it might take a week or two to work that in.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.480]   Speaking of which, transplant, that's a no-no.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.680]   People ask me a lot about transplants,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.740]   because transplants are so incredibly expensive.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.840]   But we don't even deal with transplants.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.240]   It's just too much red tape.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.520]   - You don't mean hair transplants,
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.880]   you mean like organ transplants.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.120]   - Liver transplants, heart transplants, you know.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.000]   People are on waiting lists, and they're desperate.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.760]   - And to your point about wait times,
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.440]   my friend was at Bummergard with this executive physical,
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.660]   and the doctor came to him and said,
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.000]   "Hey, you know, there's a few spots on your back.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.060]   "I'd love a dermatologist to look at it,
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.580]   "and if they need to do anything, they can do it,
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.940]   "but it's gonna be a wait."
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.000]   And he goes, "Oh, do I need to come back tomorrow?"
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.800]   He goes, "No, no, no, no, maybe 20, 30 minutes."
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.640]   You know, like, and he was just dying that like,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.360]   they were so apologetic that seeing a dermatologist
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.160]   to do a check and a procedure last minute
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.240]   would take 20 or 30 minutes,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.720]   and he added $100 to the visit.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.920]   - I always bring my laptop with me to a hospital
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.680]   because I like to work
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.200]   rather than just sit around and twiddle my thumbs.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.420]   And the third time that I sat down at Bummergard,
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.340]   and was greeted by a nurse, three minutes later,
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.280]   I looked up and I said,
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.220]   "How do you get any work done around here?"
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.120]   You know?
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.880]   And it was hilarious because, yeah,
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.920]   I don't wanna oversell it,
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.800]   but it's a really different experience.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.360]   And people that go to the right hospitals
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.040]   and the right clinics for the right reasons
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.280]   come back glowing.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.720]   And that's one of the big reasons
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.560]   why medical travel is growing so rapidly
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.440]   is number one, the inventory is growing
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.360]   of quality clinics around the world
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.680]   that wasn't there 15 and 20 years ago.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.080]   And that leads to more and more patients
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.900]   having patient experiences,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.260]   which leads to word of mouth,
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.980]   which leads to a growing industry,
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.780]   not to mention the fact that healthcare costs
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:15.140]   rose another 8% last year out of pocket.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.260]   - Do you recommend people get kind of a more beefed up
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:21.300]   travel insurance policy or anything like that
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.560]   when they're doing medical travel?
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.400]   - Not really.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.300]   I mean, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.580]   I don't wanna be liable for it,
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.420]   but I would say you're probably at less risk
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.280]   because you're in a very protected environment.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.980]   In most medical travel experiences,
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.420]   a shuttle or even a limousine picks you up at the airport,
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.180]   takes you to your hotel or takes you to your hospital.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.940]   You're in a very sheltered environment
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.980]   and you're not gonna be out there partying
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.420]   and wandering around the streets,
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.660]   drinking and having a ball.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.020]   So your chances of actually coming to some kind of harm
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.460]   and needing travel insurance
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.620]   are probably lower as a medical traveler,
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.940]   but it all depends on your appetite for risk.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.380]   So if you want travel insurance, fine.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.400]   If you don't, that's fine,
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.520]   but don't confuse travel insurance
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.320]   with medical travel insurance
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.040]   because travel insurance has nothing to do
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.440]   with premeditated planned medical travel.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.000]   - And is there anything that people should be thinking about
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.320]   on that front if they're kind of worried
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.080]   something could go wrong and they wanna be protected?
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.360]   - There just isn't enough.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.080]   I mean, it's still basically a very large cottage business.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.440]   If you're asking is there some kind of an insurance
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.640]   that covers the medical traveler,
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.240]   there is, but it's too expensive.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.400]   - Okay, and last, what are some common mistakes
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.840]   or things that kind of a first timer might overlook
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.660]   or kind of your list of don'ts
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.140]   when someone's looking to go do some medical travel?
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.040]   - The main thing, and I can't emphasize it enough,
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.900]   don't cost shop.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.440]   Once you've done your research,
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.940]   don't try to get the best price.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.700]   Don't try to get the greatest discount
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.080]   'cause that's what gets so many patients in trouble.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.180]   Don't fail to do your research.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.360]   Don't fail to really thoroughly research your doctor
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.740]   or your clinic.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.840]   I would also say don't scrimp on lodging
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.880]   and accommodations.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.940]   You don't need to go to the Ritz or Four Seasons,
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.440]   but don't go to some guest house
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.880]   that doesn't have a lot of facilities.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.760]   You wanna spend quality time recovering
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.260]   from the shock of a complex dental treatment or a surgery.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:29.620]   I would say don't settle for second best.
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:34.300]   You wanna get a clinic that's really, really
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.500]   well-accredited, looks good, feels good,
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.620]   and don't fail to walk away.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.380]   If you've done all your homework and you get there
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.980]   and you've had a great customer experience
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.880]   and you see the doctor and you actually get to the clinic
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.780]   and somehow you don't like it, walk away.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.840]   Even in country, while you're there,
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.460]   you might be able to find a clinic that's even better.
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.180]   But trust your instinct, and they're most often right.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.620]   I mentioned cuisine.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.420]   Watch out for the local cuisine.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.540]   Don't be too adventurous.
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.380]   Save that for a little later after you're fully recovered.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.640]   And once again, I can't emphasize it enough,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.940]   don't cost shop.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.060]   That's what gets most of our people in trouble.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.300]   - And you said, if you don't be too adventurous
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.620]   right before your procedure, two things.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.540]   One, how much buffer time do you like to put
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.920]   around your medical travel, and how appropriate is it
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.540]   to combine it with a vacation?
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.300]   - That depends on the depth of the procedure.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.840]   If you're just going for a teeth cleaning
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.740]   or a veneers or a whitening or something like that,
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.080]   and there's not a lot of invasive activity,
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.920]   you can plan a vacation around it.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.520]   The other choice is to take your vacation first.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.680]   A lot of people don't like doing that
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.220]   because, ah, I've got this dental procedure ahead of me,
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.980]   or I've got this medical procedure, it makes me nervous.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.460]   But you could always take it first
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.660]   and then go in for your treatment.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.340]   Most doctors want eight to 10 days
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.460]   for you to stay in country,
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:56.040]   and they often make you sign paperwork
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.460]   that commits you to staying eight to 10 days.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.140]   Because if you don't have a complication
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.220]   eight to 10 days out,
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.580]   then chances are you're not gonna have a complication.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.260]   The wound management is gonna be behind you.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:12.080]   The antibiotics regimen will be largely behind you,
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.320]   and they want you to stay in country to protect you.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.380]   So if you've got the time, and most people don't,
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.580]   10 days after your procedure,
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.660]   knock your lights out, party on.
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.040]   But don't do what I did.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.900]   I got an implant in Costa Rica.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.800]   The next day, got on a bus for Dominical on the coast,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.940]   and literally fell out of the bus halfway
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.940]   because the roads were so bumpy that it was killing me,
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.060]   and I was swelling by the hour.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.340]   I should have never left my hotel room.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:43.020]   This was my first medical travel experience
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.200]   early in the research stages of the book.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.480]   So the mistakes that you see that I list in the book
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.400]   are mostly mistakes that I and colleagues of mine
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.120]   have made in their journeys.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.680]   - Yeah, the book's fantastic.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.880]   Anyone that wants to go deep should check it out.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.000]   You mentioned you're working on a new version.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.160]   When does it come out?
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.820]   - It comes out in the late summer, early fall.
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.520]   It's taken even more time for us to do the research
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.160]   'cause the data took so long to rebuild after the pandemic
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.480]   where everything went to zero.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   Clinics weren't open, borders weren't open,
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.960]   medical travel dropped to zero.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.520]   As far as the general information,
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.760]   there's some updated stuff in there for technology.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.320]   The introduction is gonna be a little more political
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:24.820]   because of some of the recent occurrences.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.200]   A wound has been lanced, a boil has been lanced
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.520]   with some of the recent events,
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:35.040]   and the shortcomings of U.S. healthcare
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.680]   are now very much out in the open,
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.300]   and people like me are no longer lone voices
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.140]   in the wilderness.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.920]   And I do believe that medical travel's gonna become
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.120]   more and more of an option, especially for younger folk,
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.300]   40s and 50s, I'm an old geezer,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:51.640]   but they're gonna be much more prone to looking for options
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.600]   because a lot of people right now are really pissed off
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.040]   and they want to find options.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.440]   And the options, unlike 15 and 20 years ago,
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.220]   are now out there for almost every reasonable procedure
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.320]   that you can think of.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.640]   - For the people listening to this show,
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.760]   I think they're probably well-versed
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.700]   in the game of points and miles,
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.040]   which can take the travel cost of medical travel
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.600]   down to almost nothing.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.240]   And so if you figure the right credit card signup bonus
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.480]   might cover your entire trip
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.240]   to whatever country you're going to,
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.360]   and that just makes it an even more valuable proposition
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.040]   to consider medical travel.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.920]   - There are some larger companies
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.280]   that are actually very close to carving out partnerships
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.040]   with some of these medical travel providers
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.960]   to provide a loyalty card strictly for medical travel.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.440]   So watch out for that.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.400]   We covered a lot.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.880]   Where can people find you and the book
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.880]   and any other resources you've put together?
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.720]   - Patientsbeyondborders.com.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.240]   And you can find the book anywhere.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.960]   It's in digital form, it's in book form.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.520]   But I hate to say it,
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.560]   but I'd advise people to wait a few months
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.300]   until the fifth edition comes out.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.760]   But the general information in the fourth edition,
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.360]   how to plan your trip, what to do when you get there,
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.600]   how to keep yourself safe when you get back
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.440]   is all remains current
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.920]   'cause healthcare doesn't really change that much.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.960]   How to take care of yourself pre-surgery and post-op
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.320]   has not changed very much in the last five years.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.160]   - Great.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.240]   We'll put links to everything you mentioned
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.360]   in the show notes.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.400]   Joseph, thank you so much for being here.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.360]   - Well, thank you.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.600]   And I appreciate your time.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.200]   And I wish anyone who is influenced by this show
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.240]   a safe and healthy medical journey.
