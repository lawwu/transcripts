[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Desiring God is your signature book, Pastor John. It was first published in 1986, and of course
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.160]   Desiring God is the name of the ministry, too, but it's also the title of this foundational
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.840]   400-page book, and in the last podcast you talked a little bit about how and why Chapter 10 on
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.960]   suffering came about as an added chapter to the second edition of the book released in 1996.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.640]   Explain this a little bit more for us. Why did you add the chapter on suffering and sacrifice?
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.880]   We were talking about how to prevent Christian hedonism, which basically says,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.640]   "Pursue your joy in God." How to prevent joy from being our God instead of God being our God. And
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.720]   I gave about, what, four or five or six ways that Christian hedonism avoids that mistake,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.120]   and I was talking there about an experience early on where I don't think I felt as fully
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.880]   as I should how this would land on people. And here's the example I had in mind. I published
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:15.160]   the book Desiring God, and a review of it was written by a missionary. Actually, it was a
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.520]   mission advocate, you might say. I can't even remember his name now, but it was a pretty
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:29.080]   scathing review in a mission journal or somewhere. And basically it said, "Piper's view is just
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.480]   warmed over middle-class American," he didn't use the term "prosperity gospel," but, you know,
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.640]   "feel-good Christianity." And I just, I thought to myself, "Did he read this?" And I thought,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:54.720]   "You know, in order to avoid that misunderstanding, I'm gonna have to hammer a lot more clearly on a
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.320]   robust doctrine of suffering and a robust doctrine of self-denial." Because all he heard there was,
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.280]   "Be happy anyway, and if you're not happy, you must be sinning." And he just heard it as so
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.600]   superficial, and there was none...in those days I hadn't used the term from 2 Corinthians 6:10,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.280]   "Sorrowful yet always rejoicing." That's become a mantra for me now, because life, I think,
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.520]   lived by John Piper for 40 years, has taught me that while the book is titled Desiring God,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.160]   it's not titled Having Arrived at Perfect Constant Pleasure in God. There is sorrow
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.520]   at every turn of the road in this fallen life, not only because things go hard for us, but now
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.880]   in this modern world we can watch people suffer everywhere all the time. Anytime anything happens
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.800]   in the world of a painful kind, it makes its way to our eyes. And therefore, if we weep with those
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   who weep, like Paul said, there's always reason to weep, which means if we can't have a theology,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.920]   if Christian hedonism can't create a people who can cry and rejoice at the same time,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.600]   let's just close up shop. Because you should always be crying, and you should always be
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.960]   rejoicing, and there's always reason to do both in your life. And so you will be oscillating in
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.840]   and out with what you present to the people in front of you, but inside there's always going
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.520]   to be this burden that you carry for pain of the people that you know or the people you don't know,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.800]   and the joy that you have in God, who's the triumphant lover of your soul, and will work
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   everything together for good. So the upshot, Tony, of that discovery from that encounter,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.040]   back whenever that was, '80, '86, I published the book, I guess, or '87, I have tried to put
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.920]   a chapter on suffering or an article on suffering or a sermon on suffering or an illustration of
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.760]   suffering in almost every presentation I make about Christian hedonism, lest anybody make
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.400]   that observation that, "Oh, this is just another one of those American middle-class feel-good
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:34.160]   theologies," when in fact, my whole purpose was to destroy and attack a comfortable settling in
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.760]   with the American way, which I think finds its pleasure in stuff, not God.
