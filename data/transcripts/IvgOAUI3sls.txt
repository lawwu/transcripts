[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]   For me, today is, in some sense, the first day of summer. I'm a college professor and my final
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.600]   grades were submitted last week. I hosted the lunch for the graduating seniors. Commencement
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.720]   was on Saturday. The campus has just shut down for the summer season. Unlike most professors at
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.340]   most research universities, however, I don't take summer salary. As soon as the spring semester ends,
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.360]   I am officially off the clock until the fall comes. I've received no paycheck from the university.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.300]   I received no paycheck from the grant agencies during the summer. There is no expectations from
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.920]   anyone else. My time is my own. Here is the schedule that I more or less try to run
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.640]   during these summers of no external obligations. I try, if possible, to have no professional
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.700]   appointments, meetings, or calls on Mondays or Fridays. I want to begin and end my week with
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.680]   quiet and depth. So the transition into the weekend and from the weekend back into the
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.580]   week is one that is much more gradual and subtle and cognitively rewarding. You're not going from
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.020]   a quiet Sunday to a crazy Monday. I try, when possible, to make one of those days, Monday or
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.520]   Friday, an adventure-thinking day where I'll spend at least three or four hours, usually somewhere
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.900]   outside in nature, being way too hot because I do live in Washington, D.C., but maybe going to
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.800]   like the Pactuxic Wildlife Refuge right outside of the Beltway or to Wheaton Regional Park or to the,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   the, the, I like the, the Rachel Carson Greenway, to a trail, go for a hike, spend a couple hours
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.920]   outside, go to Rock Creek Park, bring my notebooks and try to really work through ideas. For Tuesday,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.560]   Wednesday, and Thursday, those days start with deep work. I don't look at an email or a computer until
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.260]   midday. Then in the afternoon, I have an admin block. What I try to do is have 30 minutes on my calendar
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.320]   midday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, where like a, a, a furious, a furious task
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.620]   completing machine. I go through small logistical things that have piled up and try to make as much
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.880]   progress as possible. In the afternoons on those three days is when I'll have calls, I'll have
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.860]   interviews, I'll have, you know, professional related, uh, appointments. And I try to end those days
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.220]   by four. That is my summer schedule and I love it and I can get away with it because I, I have these
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.940]   really slow summers, but it is a vital part of my success. It is a step away from the frantic demands
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.560]   of the school year. I get my best thinking done during the summer. I produce on my best right in
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.000]   the summer. It's when I recharge for the year ahead. So I want to talk to you today about this general
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.080]   strategy of seasonality. I'm going to argue that it's important for basically everyone, especially if
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.220]   you have some sort of knowledge or office work job, you might not be able to push your summer schedule
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.880]   to the same extreme as mine, but I think it should be different. I'll argue why. And then I'll give you
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.860]   some ideas about how you can do that. Even if you have less flexibility than myself. All right, let's
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.500]   start with the case for the seasonality, taking one season to be different and less intense than other
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.160]   seasons. When it comes to your work, I'm going to read something from my, uh, my book here, the Bible
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.020]   for the show, slow productivity. I wrote about this idea, did some good research on this. So I'm going
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.560]   to take a second to take advantage of the research I already did. All right. I'm going to read here.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.160]   The side-by-side comparison underscores the degree to which our experience of work has transformed during
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.420]   the recent past of our species. Our shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture, the Neolithic
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.960]   revolution only really picked up speed somewhere around 12,000 years ago. By the time of the Roman
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.920]   empire foraging had almost completely disappeared from the human story, this reorientation towards
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   agriculture through most of humanity into a state similar to that of the rice farming Agta, grappling
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.000]   with something new, the continuous monotony of unvarying work all day long, day after day. All right. So I'm
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.320]   arguing here. I, I, so I, I do a, before this, I went through a treatment of what the foraging and hunting
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.280]   and gathering life was like in which we spent most of our species existence. Drawing
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.040]   on some more recent research from the Agta people in the Philippines, where you have the same people
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.400]   that divided half of the group, went to rice farming and the other half stayed with foraging. There's
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   interesting research from the 2000s where they compared the lifestyle between these two groups. They were
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.120]   otherwise very much controlled to be the same people in the same type of geographical region. And they found that,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.360]   oh, the, the hunting and gathering foraging group has way more variation in their days.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.080]   Busy periods, non-busy periods, busy seasons, non-busy periods. So what I'm arguing here is
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.240]   that change with agriculture, our days when we were working became uniformly hard days. However,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.280]   I'm going back to reading here, the one saving grace in this scenario is that agriculture didn't demand
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.680]   this homogenized effort the entire year as the busy sowing and gathering of crops is offset by the quiet
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.880]   of winter. So we went from hunting and gathering and foraging where even within a given day,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.280]   there's huge variation in intensity. This hour is really locked in because we're in the middle of a
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.360]   hunt, but the next two hours we're taking a nap during the midday sun. Then we get agriculture.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.120]   I said, no, no, when you work, we have this new idea of like working sun rise to sun set of equal
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.560]   intensity. Our paleolithic for bearers did not have such uniform intensity, but at a bigger scale,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.320]   you had busy seasons and less busy seasons. The fall was very busy. The winter was not.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.520]   Moving forward in the human story, and I'm reading again here, the industrial revolution stripped away
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.960]   those last vestiges of variation in our work efforts. The powered mill followed by the factory
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.200]   made every day a harvest day. Continuous monotonous labor that never alters. Gone were the seasonal
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.240]   changes and since making rituals. Marks for all his flaws and overreach hit on something deep with his
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.440]   theory of entrefundung. I said that perfectly, Jesse, by the way. Estrangement, which argued
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.720]   that the industrial order alienated us from our business, our basic human nature. The workers
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.120]   eventually inevitably fought back against this grim situation. They pushed for reform legislation like
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.160]   the Fair Labor Standards Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 1938, which fixed 40 hours as a standard
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.560]   work week, limiting the fraction of the day that could be snared a monotonous effort without extra pay.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.600]   They also formed labor unions as a counterbalance to the more dehumanizing aspects of industrialization.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.440]   All right. So what happens next is the factory in the mill is a brand new thing where we said,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.920]   not only are you going to work all day long at equal intensity, there are no seasons anymore.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:34.880]   The textile mill doesn't care if it's January versus June. Now, all year round, there's not going to be
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.760]   a change. What I'm arguing here in the book is that this was deranging for people. This was like
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.600]   really difficult. It's not what our species evolved to do, to hard work all day long without change all
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   year round. Very unnatural. And so we had to, at least to make it bearable, get things like reform
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.520]   legislation and labor unions to at least try to have like some pushback there. Finally, we get the
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.960]   knowledge work, which brings us to what us as our audience, you know, to our world. So let me read
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.320]   here briefly. Then knowledge work entered the scene as a major economic sector. The managerial class
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.800]   didn't know how to handle the autonomy and variety of jobs of this new sector. Their stopgap response
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.160]   was pseudo productivity, which used visible activity as a proxy for usefulness. Under this new configuration,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.960]   we took another step backward. As in the industrial sector, we continued to work all day, every day,
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.480]   without seasonal changes, as any such variation would now be received as non-productiveness. But unlike in the
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   industrial sector, in this invisible factory, we'd constructed for ourselves, we didn't have reformed
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.840]   legislation or unions to identify the most draining aspects of the setup and fight for limits. Knowledge
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.200]   work was free to totalize our existence, colonizing as much of our time from evenings to weekends to
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.800]   vacations as we could bear, and leaving little recourse beyond burnout or demotion or quitting when it became
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.520]   too much. Our estrangement from the rhythms of work that dominated the first 280,000 years of our species
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.840]   existence was now complete. So the argument I'm making there is that we've sort of invented, when it comes
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.080]   to knowledge work, the most unnatural possible way of approaching work. It is as far as we have ever
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   been as a species away from how we spent most of our time as a species. Kind of had this steady march away
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.840]   from the way we were wired to exist for the Paleolithic. Agriculture made it a little farther
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   from that. The Industrial Revolution was even farther from that, and we had to bring in protection so that
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   at least it didn't overwhelm us, and at least we recognized, "Hey, this is really unnatural, so you
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.800]   better pay us well and extra pay, and we're going to push back." And then knowledge work got rid of all
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.760]   that and just left with the really unnatural pace, and everyone now pretended like this was good though,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.320]   and this was somehow like what it meant to be productive. So seasonality pushes back against that.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.120]   It goes back towards our agricultural roots and even farther back to our forager roots where it says we
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.360]   have busier periods and less busier periods, a busy time of year and a less busy time of year.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.320]   When you better match the natural rhythms for which we're wired, your life becomes more tolerable and
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.400]   sustainable, and over time you produce better quality work because when you're in this unnatural
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.880]   edifice of continuous, invisible factory labor, you just burn out. And then it just becomes activity
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.200]   for the sake of activity. And yeah, you're working all day long, but what does that work? Well, a lot
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.360]   of it's going to be moving emails back and forth, taking on those unnecessary meetings because at least
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.240]   it's something that's not too taxing and looks like you have activity. It's not a good way of producing
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.400]   results, and it's a great way of burning out the human psyche. So I am a big believer in having
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   variation. I will say as an aside, by the way, Jesse, that whole,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.680]   I won't name names, but that whole sequence in this book, which came out of a New Yorker piece
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.480]   that came out before the book, starting with the hunting and gatherers, moving through agriculture
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   into the industrial revolution, how we got alienated from our rhythms, quoting Marx and Marx's theory of
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:02.080]   estrangement to talk about what happened when we finally separated so much from what we were wired for.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:10.640]   A book that came out not too recently had that exact same arc with the same example, citing some of the
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.320]   same studies, ending up with Marx and the theory of estrangement or whatever. I don't think the
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.720]   author like was stealing it. I think his research assistant just like came across my New Yorker piece
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.240]   at some point, or like, great, here's some ideas. They went into their system. And this is kind of the
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.520]   problem of the modern way that a lot of these nonfiction writers write, where they just have a research
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.680]   to have a research assistant gather a bunch of stuff on a bunch of topics. And then the writer
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.920]   has a bunch of examples to pull from to make their points. I think they just, he just digested my New
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.840]   Yorker piece, broke it into its pieces. And then the author was like, oh, these are good research parts
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.680]   and reconstructed my exact arc basically in his book.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.960]   Did you read the book?
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.600]   Have you reviewed it on your monthly books?
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.160]   You're trying to get me to, you're trying to get me to identify who this is. I will, I will not identify
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:03.440]   who this is. But yes, it was the baseball book of why. It was a weird tangent that author went on. I don't
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   know what Marxist theory of estrangement had to do with baseball trivia, but you know, damn him. I'm on,
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.960]   I'm on to him. Hey, it's Cal. I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   then you need to check out my new book, Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.240]   Without Burnout. This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.920]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.600]   I know you're going to like it. Check it out. Now let's get back to the video.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   All right. Seasonality. So how do we do this? Well, what I do with my summer schedule is one
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.000]   example, but that's pretty specific to be, I mean, it's like why I became a professor and writer was
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.160]   exactly to be able to do that. Flexibility and schedule and, and the job, like the writing that
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.800]   could sort of support me to take time off like that and give me like an activity to do. There's a lot of
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.280]   ideas you can do that are smaller. That'll give you a taste of seasonality. I have a few to suggest
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.520]   here as you think about the summer ahead. One, consider having one day each week, maybe a Monday
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.840]   or Friday, where for the most part, you don't schedule appointments. Don't make a big deal about
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.440]   this. Don't announce it. Don't tell people when they ask you when you're available that you're not
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.640]   available on Mondays. Have plenty of options to suggest like, yeah, I have this day, this day. How
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.440]   about here, here, here? Just don't happen to suggest days on this day that you have secretly
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.960]   marked for yourself as a no meeting day each week. It won't always work, but many weeks it will. And to
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.000]   have one day a week or two days a week where especially connected to a weekend where you can
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.760]   get into your work and get caught up and see what's going on at a more of a leisurely entry pace and not
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.720]   have to jump into a thousand meetings really makes a big difference, makes the season seem slower.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.280]   If possible, try to make one of those days into more of an adventure day. Get out of your normal
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.240]   workspace if you can, especially if you were able to work remote, go into nature, go to a museum,
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.640]   go to the mall in DC. It's what I used to do. Make it feel different. Now,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.200]   still work, work on your notebook, bring your laptop with you, still get things done,
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.240]   but in a completely different location. It just makes the pace of work seem different.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.560]   I would also suggest, oh, I lost a page here.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.640]   Where did I put? Oh, I see what I did here, Jesse. I put my ads in the wrong place.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.080]   Okay. So no meeting days. Yes. All right. Another thing you should think about doing is pushing new
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.040]   project start times. Again, you don't need to make a big deal about this, but you can wind down
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.960]   your projects as the summer starts. And as you take on new projects, be like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.400]   finishing up some things now, but like late August, I'll get that ramped up. That's close enough in the
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.640]   future that people are like, yeah, fine. That's reasonable. But what you've done is created a bit
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.560]   of a lacuna in your schedule here. There's going to be this period where you're not really starting or in
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.160]   the middle of any big projects. Now you can't do this all the time because eventually the projects
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.040]   have to get done. So you can't keep pushing them into the future. But once a year, you can start
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.800]   saying for a little while when new projects are coming to you, like, yeah, I'm finishing up a
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.200]   bunch of stuff now, but what if like in mid August, I'll take this on? And the reality is you're not
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.040]   really finishing up that much stuff, but it does buy you some space. Put your hand down more. And what I
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.520]   mean by that is when it comes to volunteer activities within your work, especially what researchers call
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.480]   non-promotable activities, like organizing the internal office birthday parties or this or that,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.520]   maybe you're that reliable go-to person that likes to help out and people like that about you.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.820]   That's great, but put your hand down for a couple months. Just don't volunteer or say, I don't know,
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.700]   I'm a little busy right now. Again, if you do this all the time, then people might be like, oh man,
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:46.360]   he or she looks never useful. It's kind of annoying. You do it for a month or so for six weeks. No one notices
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.160]   then because like you're mainly volunteering a lot. They won't notice, but it makes these periods feel
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   different. You just have less of this extra work on your plate. This is a strategy I talked about in my
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.280]   slow productivity book. The idea of like a highly autonomous blocker project. You take on a project
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:09.220]   for the summer that you can keep referring to to try to push away other type of work. Like, well,
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.280]   yeah, I can do that, but I'm working on the Maguire report, right? And like, that's where my head's down on
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.460]   this, but after I finished the Maguire report, like I can work on these other types of things.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.420]   Choose that proverbial Maguire report to be something that's highly autonomous that you can,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:30.540]   in reality, do like an hour every day and stay on top of it. It is a extremely effective strategy.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.460]   People don't know how long work takes. Most people are like pretty inefficient. You take something where
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.140]   you have a lot of flexibility. It doesn't generate a lot of meetings. It doesn't make you have to be on
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.900]   other people's schedule. Be efficient and effective and then use that thing to push everything else off
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.160]   your plate for a little while. You can only get away with that so long, but really we're just looking for
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:54.680]   a month or two of respite. Start your day slowly. Apologize only if people notice. Like, start your day in
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.940]   the coffee shop. Like, get a little breakfast and coffee. Work there for a while. Just change the rhythm
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:05.060]   of the day. So, it just feels slower. It's not as frantic as other times of years. Like, this is
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:12.880]   psychological, but these type of psychological differences really can add up. Finally, this idea that people keep
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.820]   getting upset about this. I'm not sure why. Just, you know, every other week, go do something midday
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.100]   some day that you don't normally do during the weekday. You go see a movie or something.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.700]   It's two and a half hours. It's not some big deal. People go to doctor's appointments and stuff all
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:31.700]   the time, but it's going to give you a completely different feel for your week. When you're in a
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:38.180]   movie theater at two o'clock and you know it's a weekday, it makes you feel like you're not just in
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.180]   like the normal invisible factory clock and clock out. This is what I do every day. It just gives you
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.340]   a sense of autonomy and slowness and control. And in the summer, do this more often. Go see some dumb
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.220]   movies, right? Especially if you're in a situation where you don't have to account for every minute of your
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.040]   time. Again, if you go to movies every day, if you stop work at two every day all the time, people
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.980]   will notice. But if once or twice a month, you're gone in the afternoon, you're back a little bit
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.520]   late. No one knows. No one notices. So you can use these smaller tips if you don't have a huge amount
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:13.600]   of autonomy to introduce some seasonality. Summer is a great time for seasonality. So hopefully a lot
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.820]   of you in the audience are going to join me in slowing down for the months ahead.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.600]   Do you ever need more than 30 minutes to do admin work?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.100]   Probably. Yeah. Sometimes it extends more. But like I try to just have this mindset of when I get in
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.460]   there, especially for like Georgetown stuff, which there's not much in the summer, but queries come up
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:41.480]   and a dean needs this or that. Just try to be like really focused and work through. The opposite
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:47.120]   problem is what I'm trying to solve more often than not, which is there's not a lot of stuff in my
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.060]   inbox right now. But try to do 30 full minutes of useful admin work, even if there's not just messages
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.540]   to answer. Like fill in the rest of the time to get ahead of things or to organize things or to
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:03.440]   preemptively like step out or prod things along. So it goes both ways. Try not to work beyond that 30
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.120]   minutes too far, but also make sure you use the full 30 minutes. This is not going to work for
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:14.180]   most jobs. It wouldn't work for my job in September, but in July, because it's an academic institution
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.620]   that's technically shut down and I'm not on salary, it's much more plausible. I also have to deal with
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.920]   writer and admin as well. But there I'm just really good at all the various teams in my life sort of
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.660]   know in the summer. Like, yeah, Cal's not, that's not his super accessible time. I guess I thought you
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.080]   were also handling your personal admin. No, that takes a, yeah, that's different.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.160]   Okay. That's different. Yeah. But that's fine. That's summertime. Yeah. You have to like mow your
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.840]   yard and work on your budgets. I got to do my taxes next week. I'm doing my budget today. Yeah. But that
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.380]   stuff's fine. That's like you're at home and I don't mind that as much. And that does take a while.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.660]   All right. Well, we got a bunch of good lister questions coming up. But first here, a quick word
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:04.340]   from some of our sponsors. I want to talk about my friends at Cozy Earth. I love Cozy Earth. This is
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.120]   one of these products or companies where I use a lot of their products. I absolutely swear by them. In
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.560]   particular, their sheets are a must have in our family. We have multiple pairs of these sheets so
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.620]   that when one is being washed, we can switch them into the bed. We have other multiple pairs for the
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.200]   guest bedroom. We travel with these if we're going to be somewhere for more than a week or two. They
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.260]   are very comfortable sheets and they're cooling. And we, my wife and I really have a hard time now
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.560]   sleeping on almost anything else. We have other things as well. We have the duvet cover. We have
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.720]   the towels. My wife has the PJs. I have one of the sweatshirts, which somehow has like a cooling
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.520]   effect, just like the sheets, which is really pretty cool. It kind of like cools you down when you're
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.720]   hot. I am a fan of Cozy Earth. I swear by them and I think you will enjoy them as well. Like
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.140]   their mission is to transform your five to nine, the time that matters most into the most comfortable
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.980]   part of your day. All right. And you're going to get that with Cozy Earth. Start with the sheets,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:05.460]   but check out the other products as well. We gave these away at least twice. We've given these away
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:14.200]   as gifts. I think I gave some to my mom and then Julie gave some. We, we, we like, so we like these
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.620]   things. We like, we like Cozy Earth. All right. They have a hundred day sleep, a hundred night sleep
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.080]   trial rather. Enjoy over three months to experience the unmatched comfort of Cozy Earth. If you're not
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.340]   completely in love with your bedding, you can return it hassle-free, but guess what? You're not going to do
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:35.100]   that. They also have a decade long warranty on their bedding products. This means years of luxurious,
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.540]   worry-free sleep, knowing that your investment is protected. Luxury shouldn't be out of reach.

[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.080]   work well. This is where Shopify enters the scene. If you're going to be selling things,

[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:46.840]   let's move on to some questions. First questions from Quiz. I'm a teacher in Texas who usually spends
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.020]   summers on long backtracking trips, which helps me recharge while walking, listening to good content,
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:57.200]   praying, and reflecting. Because of a knee injury, I can't do my usually trip this year and don't enjoy
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.560]   too much unstructured time at home. How would you suggest I structure my eight-week summer break and
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.520]   daily schedule to get similar benefits without being able to leave home or walk all day?
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:16.120]   I'm thinking maybe take up drinking. Good old-fashioned Texas moonshine or whiskey, like an old-fashioned
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   Texas cowboy. That'll get you through the eight weeks pretty well. Okay, so you can't walk all day,
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:28.260]   but I want to push on this a little more. You say you can't leave home. I don't think he means he
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.340]   can't literally leave his house. He means just like on longer trips, I guess, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.900]   Because I was going to say, you know, a few things I was going to say, but my overarching advice here
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:46.240]   is have a schedule, have a plan, right? Don't go into your day saying like, ah, whatever. The day is
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.000]   kind of awful. Just see how it unfolds. There's not much I can do because of my knee. It's that type of
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.860]   slow, uh, slow through the mud. Like I'm just sort of wasting time. I'm on my phone for three hours this
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.160]   morning. I don't even know where that when I'm going to watch some TV and see what's going on. Like that
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:11.580]   type of, uh, stuck in the mud, mired in time mentality can really be relaxing for a day, but over
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.660]   eight weeks, I think is really going to be a bummer. So you want to have some notion of a
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.460]   schedule or plan, whatever those details are. This is what I'm doing this summer. And this should
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.780]   probably involve some sort of project or projects you're working on. And these might be more intellectual,
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:29.400]   cognitive than physical, preferably things you can work on outside of your house. I mean,
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.900]   you say you can't leave your house, but you can leave your house and go different places. Start
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.260]   your morning with the paper at the coffee shop. Then you're going to the woodshed because you're
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:42.020]   working on mastering some sort of new woodworking tool, you know? Uh, yeah, your knee is hurt. You
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.020]   can't walk all day, but it's not going to be something where you can't walk on it. I mean, even
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.980]   people with knee replacements, they want you up and around. So I want you up and around working on some
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.320]   sort of projects that is not just in your house. It could be cognitive. It could be physical. Some
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.680]   mix of the two have some initiatives you're going on. I'm going to read all these books. I'm going to
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:06.740]   watch every movie that, uh, you know, every Ford movie between this 10 year period and like read
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:12.140]   books about or whatever it is, but have things to do that feels like they're rewarding. That's what
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.000]   the long hikes were. So you want something that's similarly ambitious, but just not something that
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.680]   makes such a big demand on your knee. And there needs to be a plan here. I think we tell ourselves,
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.840]   this was kind of my pushback against the sort of Ginny O'Dell hypothesis about doing nothing.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:34.280]   We tell ourselves that some sort of Rousseauian platonic ideal that doing things is a internalization
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.940]   of capitalist narratives and doing nothing is a brave resistance. And that's where we're going
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:45.160]   to rediscover ourselves. But there's only so much of literally doing nothing that we can put up with
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.880]   before we get antsy. And then what happens is, is we have all these highly polished attention economy
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.140]   tools that are very much happy to solve our problem for us. Like you're antsy about doing nothing.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.020]   look at this screen. Your eyeballs bleed. We can give you something to do. And then time just
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.080]   disappears and you come out of it feeling depressed. I was just looking at a study that was featured on
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:12.520]   NPR clip a couple months ago that was showing these connections between looking at algorithmic content
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:18.140]   and your mood. And as they, in an experiment, took people off of their phones, essentially, they found
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:25.240]   this steady increase in their actual psychological wellbeing. So it's, you know, doing nothing.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:31.220]   It's not at, we think it is very appealing, but really what we don't like is being overloaded,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:37.820]   burnt out, overworked, but we're not looking for the opposite of that. Or if we are, the opposite of
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:51.580]   grueling efforts that feel meaningless and, and pointless is efforts that are meaningful and have a
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:57.440]   point, right? So the, the, the, the, the opposite of these things that wear us out is not sitting there
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.380]   on your phone doing nothing all day. It's doing less things and doing those things better, more meaningful
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:07.260]   things. So just keep that in mind quiz and then keep, keep active, get that knee healed. Maybe PT is a big
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.700]   part of the something you're doing this summer and then get back to those hikes as soon as you
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.860]   can. All right. Who do we have next?
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.440]   Next is from Martin. In episode 352, you answered the question, am I working hard enough to get
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:25.080]   tenure? I'm a postdoc myself in computer science, but not at an R1 university. A few faculty members here at the,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.660]   are at the top of their respective fields, but we do not learn the same toolbox to publish
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:34.300]   consistently as a top venues. How do I discover these secrets if the faculty don't even know my name?
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   I mean, honestly, Martin, like if that's what you want to do, right? You want to publish, uh,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:46.700]   at the top of your field and gun for top academic positions, you need to work for those people. So if
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.340]   there's a few of those people at your school, like you want to find a way to actually collaborate with
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.300]   them. Now you might not be able to change your postdoc advisor this far into game, but if you can
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.280]   find a way to collaborate with them, Hey, I'm making your life useful. I'm writing a paper with you and
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.780]   doing a lot of the work. That's what you have to do. I mean, it's an apprenticeship system.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.380]   High-end academia is an apprenticeship system. You have to find an apprenticeship. It is very hard
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.940]   otherwise to make your way into this sort of metaphorical guild. So see if there's a way you
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.480]   can write a paper with these top of the line faculties. I mean, good for you for noticing based
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.520]   on last week's answer, that's who you need to be allied with. If you have this very narrow goal
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.980]   of publishing the top places and getting access to these types of jobs. So you got to find a way to
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:33.460]   actually work with them. It's very difficult to learn these things from afar. All right, who do we got
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:39.680]   next? Next question is from Will. Even if the short form content topics are still relatively deep,
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.360]   do you still caution against short form content creation and encourage long form writing as a way
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.340]   to sustainably build an audience? Or do you think today's attention economy is too focused on social
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:54.480]   media to the point where the barrier to entry is too high for a new successful blog or sub stack?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.900]   So I was questioning a little bit his use of the word short and long. Maybe you have a better sense
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.920]   here, Jesse. When he's saying short form versus long form, is long form books?
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.700]   No, long forms is a blog or a sub stack and short form is like a YouTube short or something like that.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:19.220]   Oh, I see. So he's saying, is it, is it too hard to the long form stuff that I talked about before?
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.700]   Is it too hard now to start with that?
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.860]   Yeah. Like to start your website and stuff like that.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:30.060]   Um, okay. So it's always been hard. Here's what I think has happened. And I don't know this,
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:38.620]   this is maybe a curmudgeonly way of looking at the media landscape. But if you look back 30 years ago,
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:44.700]   where what's dominating the, in the printed word media landscape is going to be, you know, books and
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:52.020]   the, the big glossy Conde Nast magazines that you, you find on the newsstand, there wasn't a lot of
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.200]   people who were like, Hey, I kind of want to be in that game, right? Like you didn't have to sort of
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.340]   like the average person being like, yeah, I want to be one of the authors on the shelf there at Barnes and
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.220]   Noble or in the van, you know, with my articles and vanity fair, you had like a relatively narrow group of
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.900]   people who wanted to be professional writers. And that was a vocation. It was kind of competitive,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:15.080]   but sort of cool if you could get there. But the average person was content to be like, yeah,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.980]   I read that stuff. I think a lot of this changed with web two. And then particularly after web two
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:27.560]   gave way to social media where a big part of the pitch of phase one, social media, and I'll tell you
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:36.700]   what phase one means in a second was you can try on, you can cause play producing content for an
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:42.860]   audience. I'm convinced that this was the original sales pitch of phase one. Social media was that
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.820]   Facebook, which was the first big player, uh, they emerged in, in, in Oh four and they're generally
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.980]   public in Oh six. You have to remember at this point, web two, which had been around since like the
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:59.340]   early two thousands, which was blogs basically was pretty brutal. This technology came along is that,
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:04.920]   Hey, anyone now can publish something. You don't have to, there's not a gatekeeper at a magazine or
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.760]   a newspaper or like a web developer. You need this sort of put content. Uh, you can set up an account
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.880]   and publish something and it's on the web and anyone can read it. And what happened is a lot of people
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.000]   tried it and no one cared because it's really hard to write things as it always has been that people
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.480]   care about. And so a lot of people were disillusioned by blogs. It was, it was embarrassing.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:32.620]   It was, um, uh, it was whatever it was demotivating. I, I, I wrote and no one came.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:38.180]   Then Facebook came along and said, okay, here's our deal. You write on here, people will come.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.640]   Here's the social contact. You're going to go through the contract. You're going to go through
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.620]   and you're going to indicate all these other Facebook users who know you, and we're going to
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.700]   tell them about stuff when you publish it. And yeah, the stuff doesn't matter, but there's going to be
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.180]   a social contract that they'll come over and they'll click like and poke and write comments
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.720]   and you'll do the same for them. And we can all sort of, uh, feel what it's like
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:03.460]   to be producing, you know, ideas and commentary and have an audience that cares about it.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.900]   So we all can kind of cosplay in a lightweight way what it would feel like to actually be
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.960]   Michael Lewis writing these pieces for Vanity Fair, right? Or Malcolm Gladwell producing these
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.500]   books that are getting all, you know, these readers. And that was a big appeal of phase one
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:21.800]   social media. Now that changed, we got the phase two, TikTok brought us into the phase
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.260]   two where we said, you know, forget publishing your own stuff. What really matters is just
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:30.620]   like put it right into my veins, algorithmic distraction. And we kind of gave up caring
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:35.440]   about posting stuff and what people thought about us and was just like, put it right in my veins
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.200]   until my eyes bleed. That's phase two where we are now. I think that was the original pitch
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:47.260]   of phase one social media. And so it really traded on this idea that like, yeah, not only is the ability
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.940]   to publish words accessible to a lot of people now, but like, it's, it's really like kind of right
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.900]   there. You get a couple of right breaks and some stuff goes viral and, and, and you just feels like
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.360]   you're right there. You're posting stuff and people, you know, you have this built-in audience that'll
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   look at it a little bit and anything could go viral at any time. And you hear stories about it.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:09.920]   And suddenly now this became something that it was like running triathlons or something that like a
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.680]   lot of people could do. And I think it changed our, our approach to things like professional content
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.020]   production to like, Hey, maybe I should do this, which again, you don't hear a lot of people in
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.840]   1985, just casually be like, walk by and see someone reading, you know, the New Yorker and be like, Hey,
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.240]   I should write for that. That might be fun. Like I can start doing that because there was just like
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.120]   less venues and they're really hard. So this has been curmudgeonly, but I'm coming back to this and
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.560]   saying, well, what content are you producing? Like, do you want to be a professional writer?
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.780]   Then like, you should go down the path of becoming a professional writer. Don't be seduced into this
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.540]   idea that there's some sort of shortcut into that that requires a lot less effort and a lot less
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:54.420]   hard hoops to make it through where I'm posting short-term content and something takes off. And,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.180]   and, you know, next thing you know, I'm a writer on SNL or whatever, like, yeah, that happens,
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:06.200]   but really not that often. So, um, is the media attention economy too focused for things like a
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.240]   successful blog or sub stack or a podcast or books? No, I think it's like, it's always been. It's very
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.700]   hard. It's, it's, it's no easier, no harder than it's always been. If you want people to read your
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.820]   articles or books or listen to your podcast, which is kind of like an audio version of like long
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.380]   articles, it's like, like it was 30 years ago. It's hard. You have to have like an extra expertise and a
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.300]   voice and, and, and like find, you know, your audience and what you offer and have a couple
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.280]   swings that finally connect and then build on those as the same thing that professional writers have
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.180]   been doing all the time. And I don't think it's any harder, any easier than it's been before.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:42.460]   We just have this other thing over here, which is the, the, the cause plane that you get in
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:47.420]   attention economy, social media, where everyone feels like they're pretty good. And there are,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.780]   there are one lucky break away from being the next Kim Kardashian that I think has warped how we
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.860]   think about content creation, but I'm a big believer in writing professionally.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:04.540]   I just put these reality checks on it that it's like very hard, right? There's the digital technology
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.080]   did not make this something that is easier for like a huge number of more people to succeed at.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.760]   It changed the forms in which you can do it. It changed the economic for the people who are good
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.380]   at it. Now you have more control over how you reach and get to your audience, but it doesn't
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.760]   actually give you a big audience that is still earned. I think the ways that it always was.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.980]   So I don't know. I feel like I'm going on a rant here, Jesse, but it's something I've been thinking
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:32.580]   about recently is that again, 30, 40 years ago, it would be more rare that someone just be like,
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.060]   I want to be publishing stuff that people read. It was like the people who really want to be a writer.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:44.000]   And now I think it feels more accessible in a way in part because social media like plays on this idea
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.200]   of like people are listening to you and like you're, you're like one or two good quips away from like a
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:55.360]   retweet storm that's going to make you famous. And so I guess my answer is like the entry, the entry
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:00.640]   level is not too high. It's as high as it's always been, which is pretty high. It is hard. I was having
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.780]   this conversation with someone recently, like, well, how do you succeed with a podcast? It's like,
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.820]   it's hard. Like typically you have to have something else going that's already big.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.120]   All these things. It's like sub stack. It really helps if you're already well-known. You're already
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.840]   a journalist who's well-known. Then like you could maybe build a successful sub stack.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.780]   Do you read a lot of people's sub stacks?
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.380]   Um, some.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.400]   Do you get the email notifications?
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.940]   I just look at my inbox. Yeah. Yeah. I don't use the app or sometimes it takes me over to the app,
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.400]   but I just look for my email inbox. I like that form. I mean, email newsletters,
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.360]   I think is a great form. Podcast is a great form.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.900]   Um, I like these forms cause they're independent and you're not beholden. You're not beholden to
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.420]   like a super large companies that are using your content. I mean, sub stack does a little bit of
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.940]   this, but like email newsletters and podcasts, I think it's like a golden age of content production,
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.480]   but the people succeeding in these, it's the same people that were succeeding in like the
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.820]   magazine industry in the 1990s. It's like kind of the same number of people and some of the actual
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:04.000]   very same people, you know, like Gladwell and Lewis podcast. Uh, so the forms are different,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.380]   but I don't think this is like the misnomer about media revolutions is they don't make it easier to
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.760]   be successful. They just sort of change the terms of success. That's kind of my growing theory.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.820]   Now that we'll have our new weekly, our newsletter every week, it's going to be good. It's going to
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.860]   have a logo. It's going to have some good links. Got some good links in it. We're going to have
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.600]   links every week. I might eventually bring in a, from an archive piece at the end where just sort of
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.560]   pull out some classic stuff from the decade or so I've been writing about this stuff. It'll be good.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:37.400]   Got to hone in on my topics though. Oh, the video for the podcast. Uh, there is going to be like
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:43.260]   featuring the, that week's podcast episode will be right there. So like people who are email
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.160]   subscribing will always hear like, Oh, here's what's going on in the podcast this week.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.740]   Should be good. Yeah. And then on the podcast, what I'm going to do is in a monotone,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:57.260]   read the entire newsletter word to word every week, just all the way through page break. Uh, I'll,
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.400]   I'll read the punctuation as well because yeah, how else is I going to know? Semicolon space.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.840]   Just be like that. And that's really what the podcast is going to become. Uh, instead of me,
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.980]   I'm going to have a 1980s era Macintosh. Remember how they could talk with that robot voice,
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:17.240]   just reading out my newsletter. I think it'll be just as successful with an occasional throwing of
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.900]   your, uh, French accent with the pipe. Yeah. And then I'll come in and do a bad French accent.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:27.340]   Yeah. I think we've got this all clued in. I think, I think we are about to explode. This world is so
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:31.160]   hard by the way. It's so hard to grow podcasts and newsletters speaking to which, I mean, that would
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.500]   grow it, but what a hard world. All right. What else do we have here? All right. We have Mark.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.780]   Mark. I'm an actuary with a job that leads to adversarial interactions with regulators who are
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.960]   often challenging our assumptions in rejecting proposals. Since filings are infrequent and
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.120]   mistakes are highly visible, it's tough to design a deliberate practice routine to reduce pushback.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.100]   Well, Mark, you're actually in a situation that's really right for deliberate practice because you're
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:02.800]   getting super clear feedback. We are really mad because of X. That's great feedback on like, okay,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:09.000]   how do I never do X again? So you, you probably are in a cycle of deliberate practice here that is
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.160]   making you better. It's not fast in the sense of you're doing 20 reps a day, but like, you know,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:22.480]   each year you're getting probably a dozen or two great pushbacks, right? So great teaching signals
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.100]   about what's working and what's not working. And the rate at which you are improving at writing these
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:31.920]   types of reports that you're filing is probably impressive. If you're looking at the right time
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.400]   scale, I will throw in, however, if this job is stressing you out and it sounds like it might be,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.780]   I mean, it was stress me out. Like you're just constantly being yelled at by people who are mad
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:47.980]   with by default are mad about what you're going to send them. You might think about getting another job.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:53.640]   The key, however, is if doing so, take your career capital with you. Don't quit this job to become
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.240]   a yoga instructor, quit this job to become an actuary somewhere else, but in a non-adversarial
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.000]   environment, right? So if there's something that's emotionally draining about a position,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.460]   see if you can pick up your skills and take them somewhere else that removes that thing that is
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.400]   emotionally draining. Cause I'm suspecting that might actually be the real problem here.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.420]   You know, the sparring, I wouldn't like that either. All right, who do we got next?
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.700]   Next up is Kayla. As someone who excelled in humanities and liberal arts, I appreciated
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.640]   your suggestions to read books with opposing views to grapple with different theories and
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.420]   perspectives. However, I'm curious if you have any recommendations for how to improve
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.300]   quantitative and technical skills as a way to get smarter in a dumb world.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:38.900]   I would focus on specific projects that require you to master a new technical or quantitative skill
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.060]   to make progress. The two types of projects that you'll actually return to is either one that has
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.860]   a professional salient. So you volunteered to do this thing and your organization's like,
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.300]   yeah, that's good. Do this thing. And now they're waiting for an answer. And to get them an answer,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:58.280]   you have to pick up the new skills. That'll focus your mind or something that's really fun. I think
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.540]   there'll be really fun to, you know, build this thing that's going to require me to learn circuit
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.160]   design or I'm going to have to learn computer programming. Maybe I'm doing it with my kids,
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.660]   but have a project that you either are interested in for professional financial reasons or for fun
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:17.680]   sort of like family connection reasons and let that drive you to have to pick up new quantitative
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.920]   skills. Don't just sit with a textbook and say, all right, guys, it's coming to Torx day and just like
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.060]   sit there and try to memorize theorems. Like that's not going to be very fun, but having a project is going
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.240]   to make that easier. I like, by the way, that you brought up my suggestion from before because I always
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.540]   like to underscore that read two books that have, that are very smart and have the opposite view on
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:44.020]   something. Even independent of the content, the dialectical clash of two opposing opinions on something
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:49.300]   adds like just a new layer of nuance to your mind. It just makes you smarter. It makes you see the world
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:54.680]   in more interesting shades of gray and not black and white. It's a really interesting experience. Even if you
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:00.720]   don't care about the topic, seeing that clash just adds like a more sophisticated layer to your brain. And if it's a
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.460]   topic you really care about, then you extra sure want to read the opposing view as well because that's where you're
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.760]   really going to figure out why you care about it. It's going to strengthen your conviction. It's going to make you a
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:16.880]   better advocate for that. Do not try to avoid stuff that you think is going to be contradicting stuff that you care about
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:25.420]   because that's not a belief, right? If it's I'm avoiding contradictory information, that's not a belief acquired in good
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:30.000]   faith. It's a, an idol that you're worshiping. It's you, you like the idea of being a part of that cult.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.420]   So it's great. The challenge ideas, it's going to make them stronger. It's also great just to make you a smarter
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:41.500]   thinker to see what it looks like when you read two very opposing views. All right. Ooh, we got a case study
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.640]   this week. It's where people send in their accounts of applying the type of things we talked about on this
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.420]   show in their own life. If you have a case study, you can send it to Jesse at calnewport.com.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:57.800]   do we have a name for this week? I guess not. We'll just call this Peter. All right. Peter said
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:03.320]   at the end of 2022, my life reached a turning point. I had just become a father, father for the first
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.860]   time, released my own music after years of supporting other artists and was deeply involved in serving my
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.540]   local Baha'i community. On paper, I had achieved, his name is probably not Peter. On paper, I achieved
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:19.880]   many of my life goals, but something still felt off. I realized after talking with my wife that I was
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.960]   constantly distracted thinking about music and work while at home and feeling guilty for not being
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:31.120]   fully present with my family or in my community service. Social media, I suspected was a big part
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:38.920]   of the problem. It'd be funny here if the case study said, so I got rid of my family and now have many,
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.780]   much more time for my social media and I've never looked back.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:42.700]   His name is Cyril.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:47.560]   Cyril. Okay. Social media, I suspected, was a big part of the problem. Discovering your TED Talk and
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:52.080]   then diving into your books, especially deep work, was a revelation. It helped me see that my habits
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:57.340]   needed to change if I wanted to be truly present and effective in all areas of my life. Over the past
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.880]   two years, I've worked hard to put your ideas into practice. I've become much more intentional about
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.360]   how I organize my days, treating my music career like a knowledge work job with clear boundaries.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:11.160]   Deep work sessions are now a priority, allowing me to focus on improving my core musical skills,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.460]   which are composing, producing, singing, and playing instruments. I'm also more disciplined
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.560]   with my time. I keep social media off my phone, stick to fixed work hours, and reserve evenings
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.180]   and weekends for my family. This structure has actually made me more flexible, letting me step
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.880]   away from work when needed for family or community projects. I've also picked up new habits like boxing
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:35.480]   and reading more books, which have brought a steady sense of well-being. All right. What I really like
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.780]   about this case study is this sometimes paradoxical sounding idea that having some more structured
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:46.000]   intentionality and control of your time makes your life slower and more full and more meaningful.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.220]   There is sometimes this idea that's out there that once you begin to think more intentionally about
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.500]   your time, that necessarily means what you're doing is internalizing capitalist narratives and you're
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.120]   building your life into like a stressful scramble of trying to produce, produce, produce. But that's not
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.440]   always what's going on. An unstructured life can be busy and exhausting. An unstructured life can be
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.400]   intentional and more relaxed. And I think that's what we see in Surreal's story here.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.900]   I'm going to go back and show you a couple of things that I think are important here.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:18.380]   His job was flexible, right? It's a music production. He's not at an office working for a boss.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:23.160]   Adding clear boundaries made it much better. Here's when I work and here's when I'm done. Without that,
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:30.600]   it just bled over into the rest of his life and it was causing real distress and problems. He makes deep
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.120]   work a priority. There's lots of stuff he could be doing that's probably more fun and maybe I should
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.060]   be working on the social media pages of the bands that I'm repping and try to make sure that they're
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:44.300]   getting attention. But he says, no, on a regular basis, I want a deep work on getting better at music.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:50.140]   Long-term is probably making it much more successful. Short-term is giving him a lot more
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.980]   psychological satisfaction out of his job because it continually connects him back to the core
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:00.520]   artistic element of what he's doing and why he values it. He keeps social media off his phone
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:07.300]   and weekends and evenings are just for family. That really helps. I'm not working. I'm not on my phone.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.540]   You're going to connect to your family much more. So these seem like simple ideas, but these little
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:16.500]   rules and structures made a really big difference in Surreal's life. And so I think it is a fantastic case
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.820]   study. All right, let's do a call.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:28.360]   Hey, Alex Sorto here. I'm a commercial real estate appraiser. And my question has to do with
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:36.640]   the topic of side hustles. So there's a lot of random and conflicting advice on the internet about
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:43.240]   side hustles. And maybe some of it is unrealistic and some of it is not. But I would love it if I
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:49.620]   could create and develop a side hustle this year to keep me up float during downtimes. And I could be
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:56.300]   something that I actually particularly enjoy, like fashion or something along that line where it could
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:03.820]   be a passion as well. So I just wanted to see what were some of your ideas or best practices for
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:08.720]   creating a side hustle and implementing it into your regular schedule.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.460]   seem to be like Alex referred to me as Al. Yeah, but I think he knows your name's Cal.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:21.460]   You think it's because his name, he was queued up to say Alex. Yeah. And then, yeah. He definitely
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:27.480]   knows your name's Cal. Yeah. All right. I was going to say Alex. I'll see you in hell, buddy. But I'm
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.900]   going to, I'm going to assume that was a, that was a runtime error. I was somewhere where I was
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:38.320]   recently where I was continually introduced as Kyle. So would you rather be introduced by Al?
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.360]   Well, the weird thing is my wife who was misintroducing me. I think she just forgot.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:49.760]   No, I made that up. Uh, side hustles. All right. Uh, three things to keep in mind.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:56.220]   One, I typically would say, be wary of a side hustle where ultimately what you'll be doing is
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:03.920]   trading your hours for time. So basically wage labor side hustles, they don't scale well. Uh,
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.500]   you're typically getting less money for your time than you could get just putting those hours into
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:13.860]   your primary job. And I, it's not what you're really looking for with a side hustle, which is
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:18.780]   like a flexible and stable and potentially scalable source of side income. So it's tempting because
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.740]   they're easier to get into, it's easier to give, get people right off the bat to pay you for your
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:29.220]   time. But if you're effectively just, if I spend five hours versus 10, I'm going to get half as much
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:35.940]   money is not where you want to be in a side hustle. That's not a good side hustle. Um, two, I would say
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:41.260]   care about your existing career capital. The more that you're leveraging rare and valuable skills that
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:46.600]   you've earned, the more value you can get. And the more likely it is you can have like a really
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:52.460]   effective side hustle. So if you like something, but you don't have demonstrably rare and valuable
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:58.740]   skills in that area, the, the possibility that you are going to get sort of scalable time,
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.540]   independent income from that direction is very low. That type of low hanging fruit just gets
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.460]   washed out in efficient markets, right? If there's some like relatively easy way that you can make
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.900]   like a lot of money on some topic you're interested in and don't know much about anyone who doesn't know
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.240]   much about it could make money on that topic and they would start trying it. And then that would drive
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.940]   down the price and that market would go away. So the inefficiencies that produce good side
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.620]   hustles usually take advantage of skill. The more rare and valuable skill that you're deploying,
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.780]   the better chance you have of finding a real inefficiency and getting a really actually
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.240]   attractive side hustle. So don't ignore your career capital. You mentioned fashion,
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.460]   like you would really need some sort of career capital and fashion before you think that's going
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:40.900]   to necessarily be a good side hustle. Finally, there's an idea from Derek Sivers that I featured in my
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:46.320]   book so good. They can't ignore you when evaluating your current side hustle and whether you want,
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.940]   if it's successful or not successful, or whether you want it to become more of a full-time thing,
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:57.860]   I'm quoting them here, use money as a neutral indicator of value. All right. Are people paying
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.860]   me for this? People will tell you your idea is good. People will tell you your idea is interesting.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:07.500]   People will for free, like, yeah, I would love for you to give me a tarot card reading or whatever,
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.280]   but they don't like to give away their money. And people only give away their money if they feel
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.320]   like they're actually getting a proportional amount of value for that money. So Derek Sivers had this
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.820]   idea with the side hustles that he transformed in the full-time roles on multiple occasions throughout
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:27.380]   his interesting career is that he would use money as a neutral indicator of value. If this is generating
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.780]   money, it's valuable. If it's not, it's not. Should I make this my full-time job? Well, here's the
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.980]   question. Is it generating enough money to be my full-time job? That seems like it's really simple,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.640]   but people often ignore that. They want to sort of assign other sources of value to their idea. Like,
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.300]   well, it's really cool. I know someone else who did really well with this. My friends tell me it's
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:50.880]   awesome. It's not really a reliable indicator of value. Get people to give you money. And if they're
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:56.780]   not, the idea is not that successful. The hustle is not going to be that successful. All right.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.400]   Alex, I hope you enjoyed that advice. Jesse, I sort of reversed it back on him there.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.600]   Added a C to his name. All right. Do we have another call? Yeah, we do. All right.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:14.120]   Hi, Cal. I enjoyed your recent podcast, looking at how to become a straight A student as I am a college
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:21.360]   student. And that was my initial introduction to you. My question is, you talked for a second that
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:27.700]   if you were going to rewrite that, that you would have a section on focus. And I know that you said
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:32.520]   that you'd probably never rewrite it, but I was curious what principles you would go over in a
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:37.700]   section like that. That's something that I really struggle with and I'm trying to figure out how to
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:46.240]   implement that as a college student. So my basic framework about focus is in the book and when it
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.080]   changed. So there's a core idea in that book, how to become a straight A student from 2006. It's an
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:52:01.200]   equation that says work accomplished equals total hours spent times intensity of focus. And my point
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:07.520]   there, like why I made that argument was one of the easiest ways or most effective ways to get
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:14.100]   more work done is to not just increase the hours piece of that equation, but to increase the focused
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:18.740]   piece of that equation. They're multiplied by each other. Double your focus, you can double your output
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:25.300]   in the same number of hours. And back then I was saying what I saw is too many people would study in
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:30.160]   a low intensity of focus. So sort of at the library with their friends and reading instead of doing
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.440]   more difficult, like passive consumption instead of active recall. And they would just try to increase
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.340]   the hours component to get the amount of work that needed to be accomplished done.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:42.460]   But that's a hard game. Like you got to spend long amounts of time doing that work. And I would say,
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.200]   no, no, increase that intensity of focus. Come at this thing with laser light focus and you can
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   drastically reduce the hours needed to get the work done. And that's actually more sustainable in the
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.660]   long run because you're not spending all your time studying. That central equation still stands.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:00.880]   What's different is the obstacles to intensity of focus today versus 20 years ago.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:08.900]   You have way worse obstacles in particular in your hand, in that phone that's next to you while you
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:15.420]   study. That is a much bigger obstacle than we had to deal with in 2006. I was worried about
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:19.700]   conversations with people at the same table. I was worried about you just using low intensity
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:24.060]   techniques. So using study techniques that weren't very mentally taxing. Therefore, they didn't require
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:30.200]   much focus, but required a lot more time. And like walking over to public email terminals to like check your
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.100]   messages. Like that's the type of stuff I worried about. So you have obstacles to boosting that
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:41.600]   intensity of focus now that are way more accessible and appealing and disastrous than what we were facing
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:51.280]   back in, in 2026. But I would have one rule, one extra rule that I think translates most of the value of that
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:58.020]   equation to today. Never have your phone with you when you study. That would be the rule I would add.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:05.860]   And don't look at this like this is crazy. You're not an ER surgical attending. You're not the Pope.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:10.240]   People will be okay if they can't get in touch with you for 90 minutes. It's okay. You're not that
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:15.260]   important. Don't bring your phone with when you study. Go to a library to study. Go to a non-popular
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:22.040]   library to study. Don't have your phone with you. Now you just don't have access to those distractions,
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:27.400]   right? That's going to make it. Now you can just apply the advice as written in my 2006 book. Now
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.940]   still you have to use high intensity study tactics. They're going to get you to focus more. Use active
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.780]   recall instead of passive recall. You know, go to places where you don't have a lot of distractions.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:42.640]   There's like all the stuff I talk about now, now applies equally as well in 2026 as it was in 2006,
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:48.480]   as long as you don't have that phone with you. So it would be like my number one advice. You would want to
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:56.320]   put a giant sign over every library or public study space that, you know, says, um, abandon all ye phones,
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:03.260]   ye who enter here. A little Dante reference right there. And that, that puts you back on a level playing
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:08.420]   field. And then you actually have a chance of succeeding with focused high intensity studying.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:15.940]   Let me tell you the effect of this. It will feel like a superpower. You will, and I'm not exaggerating,
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.180]   study a third of the time of the other people in your class and you'll get good grades.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:26.040]   If you study without your phone and you use smart study techniques, like the type I talked about in
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   my book that actually work, they're hard, but actually work and not what's easier. And you boost
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:34.960]   up that intensity, you focus part of the equation and you do the time management stuff. We talked about
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.840]   a couple of weeks ago on the podcast that's in that book. You're gonna get really good grades.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.740]   You're not going to work late into the night. You're not gonna do all nighters. You're gonna
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:47.300]   have a lot of free time. So that's it. That would be the number one thing I would add. You just, just
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:52.880]   don't, don't have screen time rules. Don't get cute about it. It is just not allowed to come with me
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.940]   when I go to study. That'll make all the difference.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.940]   For the newer students in the audience, can you, in a couple sentences, explain to them what active
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.540]   recall is?
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.840]   The only way to learn new information that actually works with any sort of effectiveness is trying to
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.180]   produce the information out loud from your own brain as if lecturing a class without looking at notes.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:15.700]   That's how you learn things. The opposite of that is passive recall, which is where you read your
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:23.060]   highlighted notes. That is an incredibly inefficient way of learning stuff. I'm going to give you an
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:30.660]   analogy. Let's make the analogy trying to get like muscles larger. Passive recall is, uh, I'm going
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:35.120]   to hold a shake weight. Have you seen the shake weight, Jesse? They used to sell these in infomercials.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:40.520]   You hold, it's like a dumbbell where the two ends go and they shake back and forth, like powered by
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.400]   batteries or whatever. And like, it's shaking your muscles and like, it's going to kind of make it
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.540]   stronger. I guess you're like kind of holding it up or something. Active recall is like, I'm getting,
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.580]   I'm doing curls with heavy weights and it's kind of sucks because it's like, it's burning.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.780]   But I'm doing them, you know, on a really good schedule. Like your muscles actually get easier.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.400]   It's harder, but your muscles are going to get bigger. You can stand around with the shake weight as
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:06.580]   much as you want, but, uh, maybe get a little bit stronger. So there you go. Active recall is the only
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.620]   thing that matters. It sucks in the sense that it's really hard, but you have to think of that hardness
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:16.980]   as like the, it's not literally this, but like the feeling of your neurons reforming. You're forcing
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:21.680]   your brain into a new configuration where that information is accessible. Lecturing out loud as if
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.860]   lecture in a class. I, I preach this to my students like five or six times a semester. I even wrote, like
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.240]   I'm teaching discrete math or I was teaching discrete math, uh, to a hundred kids this semester.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.560]   Is that what all those exams are?
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.040]   That's what the, yeah. Do you see those?
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.260]   I looked at the first question.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.300]   Yeah. Not so bad.
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.180]   I don't know.
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:37.740]   Discrete probability.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:43.500]   So I have a, uh, this feels like a FERPA violation, but I was grading this weekend. And so I have all
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:49.640]   my exams, uh, in the, in the HQ cause I was grading the HQ, um, the other day, but I always tell them,
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:55.620]   I wrote an article about this when I was in grad school because I did well, uh, I got the highest
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.380]   grade. I've talked about it before, but like, that's when I realized I might have some math
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.760]   ability when I took this large discrete math classes on the ground and got the highest grade
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.480]   in the class. And so I wrote an article about, here's how I studied in that discrete math
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.800]   class. And I'm always telling my students, I wrote an art, do this, do this. Maybe they
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:17.000]   do. They do. Uh, what's a pretty good grades. That wasn't a hard exam. I don't think it was
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:23.280]   very reasonable exam. Um, so there you go. Active recall. All right. Let's, uh, what we got here?
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.340]   We got a final segment coming up. I'm going to react to something on the internet you should
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:33.600]   know about, but first let's briefly hear from another sponsor. One of the longest sponsors
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:38.100]   of this show and for good reason is our friends at Grammarly. That's because from emails to reports
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.260]   and project proposals, it's more challenging than ever to meet the demands of today's competing
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:48.300]   priorities without some help. Grammarly is the essential AI communication assistant that boost
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:53.980]   productivity. So you can get more of what you need to get done faster, no matter what it is
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:59:00.520]   you're writing or what tool it is that you're doing the writing in. I have watched Grammarly over the
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:07.700]   years embrace AI enabled features that have continued to grow its utility and producing professional and
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:15.760]   effective communication in your job. It'll produce drafts. If you want like, Hey, I got to do a quick
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.340]   draft of this. It can take a bunch of notes. You paste in there and it can put them into a better
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.200]   summary. It can look at your tone. Hey, what is the tone of this email I sent? Why don't you double
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.520]   check that for me? Um, and maybe I want to change it to like a more friendly tone or more professional
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.460]   tone. Maybe this is, you know, you worry about how you're coming across. It's there. It can help you
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:38.880]   with that. Maybe you're trying to come up with some ideas or of course the stuff that Grammarly has
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.700]   always done really well. Just check to make sure that like your, your grammar is good. And this is coming
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:47.880]   across as professional. I think of having Grammarly, like having a, uh, editor who looks over your
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.480]   shoulder with a bunch of ideas and to help you make your writing even better. Like you could hire
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:55.120]   someone to be like, let me help you with this email before you send it. Just think about how those
[00:59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.600]   advantages aggregate when you have like help with clarity and effectiveness in your communication
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.120]   and all the communication you're doing in your job, that's going to add up to you just being seen as
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.680]   like a much more capable and effective employee. So it's a fantastic, I think focused deployment of AI,
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.420]   not some grandiose, you know, this is going to take over the world. Like this is a specific
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:20.000]   thing that people need to do better in their jobs. And we're going to help you do it.

[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:05.780]   Jesse, let's do our final segment. I want to talk briefly about an article that's important and you
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:11.360]   might not realize how important it is. I'll bring this on the screen here for people who are watching
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.780]   instead of just listening. It's from the Wall Street Journal. It came out on May 15th. Here's the title.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:20.980]   Meta is delaying the rollout of its flagship AI model. The company's struggle to improve the
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:27.780]   capabilities of latest AI model mirrors issues at some top AI companies. So what's going on here is
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:36.900]   that Llama 4, which they're nicknaming Behemoth, had been the long-awaited next big large language model
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:44.560]   from Meta. They were greatly increasing the amount of compute and data, but when they finished,
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.300]   they realized this thing wasn't that much better. It wasn't better enough versus their last model
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:54.400]   to justify yet releasing it. Now, there's an important quote in here. I'm looking through the
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.420]   article now where other companies have been having similar problems. All right, let me read from the
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:04.680]   article. Meta's recent challenges mere stumbles or delays at other top AI companies that are trying
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.400]   to release their next big state-of-the-art models. Some researchers see the pattern as evidence that future
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.020]   advances in AI models could come at a far slower pace than in the past and at tremendous cost.
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:19.540]   Right now, the progress is quite small across all labs, all the models, said Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:24.500]   an assistant professor and faculty fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:30.980]   GPT-5, one of OpenAI's next big technological leaps forwards, was initially expected around mid-2024,
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.900]   the Wall Street Journal previously reported. In December, the journal reported that development
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:41.120]   of the model was running behind schedule. All right, and they give some more examples. All right,
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.740]   we can take this off the screen now, Jesse. This is pointing towards a very, very important trend in
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:51.460]   AI, but the details are a little berky, and I think most people don't know it, and I want to make it as
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:59.600]   clear as possible. Here's the best way I can explain this. There was, in the aftermath of OpenAI,
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.000]   starting to make their moves with their GPT family of models, so in particular, GPT-2 and 3.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:13.160]   There was this idea, they're called the scaling laws. There is this idea that as you continue to
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.800]   increase the amount of computation and the amount of data that you use to train these language models,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:25.260]   their skills would keep massively jumping forward, and in fact, the chart that showed this relationship
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:33.260]   between resources and ability was exponential, and for a while, it was fitting that. GPT-3 was like this huge
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:40.900]   improvement over GPT-2. GPT-4 was a huge improvement over GPT-3. It was better at like everything. It was doing
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:49.440]   it better. The visions you heard about a year or more ago about like artificial general intelligence,
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:58.500]   for example, about all work being essentially automated, was people looking forward on this curve
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:04.220]   and saying, this was so much better than that model, this model, so much better than this model. As we
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:10.480]   continue to build out the compute and get more and more data, eventually, these models will just
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:17.000]   become so capable that we can just build software agents around them to actually execute the stuff
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.520]   they say. We can just say like, hey, here's a job. Tell me how you're going to do it and have a software
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.820]   agent actually execute it. And basically, we can automate everything. It will just be able to understand so
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.260]   much about the world that we can just ask it, describe how you do this or that, and it'll be a
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.880]   general intelligence that can basically do anything that a human can do. This is going to completely
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.620]   change the world. This was the scaling vision was the vision for what was going to happen.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   The reality, however, is that the benefits of scaling are starting to give massively diminished
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:54.480]   returns. It turns out that like this exponential doesn't keep going. Hundreds of billions have been
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:01.080]   invested in building out compute and in building out the biggest possible data sets to train these
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:06.100]   things. But after roughly that GPT-4 point, the improvements begin to become diminishing. That's
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.580]   why GPT-5 hasn't come out yet. It's not good enough. It's not that much better. It's why
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:17.120]   Llama 4B myth project, they haven't released it yet. It's not that much better. And in the cases where
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:22.820]   they have put this in, you look at like Grok, I guess it's three now versus Grok two, massively more
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:29.840]   compute. It's a little bit better. So the scaling laws are kind of trailing off. So we're not going
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.660]   to, this dream of like, if we keep building bigger and bigger data centers, we don't have to do anything
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.620]   else but get bigger. And we're going to have like AGI. That's not happening. I don't think everyone's
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:43.320]   caught up to that yet. There's still so many of these sort of non-technical articles about like,
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.680]   hey, what are we going to do in a future? We're going to have no jobs. They're still looking up
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.500]   this curve. Well, look at how much better this model was in that model. If we just do that five
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.780]   more times, it's the danger of exponentials, the seduction of exponentials. We do that type of
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.900]   doubling inability five more times and like all work will be done this way. But that's starting to level
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:04.180]   out. So where is all the energy shifted? Because they still need to make improvements, right? You've
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:12.820]   noticed OpenAI has now released all these models that have weird names. It's GPT-4-0 and GT-4-0-3 and
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.380]   all these different types of weird names. Well, they're having to put their energy into much more
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.340]   narrow development. So a lot of what's happening now is they'll take what they call a foundational
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:26.060]   model, which will just be an existing model like GPT-4. And then what they're going to do is they
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:31.920]   get a particular data set about a particular type of task they care about where they can have a lot
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.360]   of examples of questions and write answers. So computer programming is a fantastic example of this is
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.460]   because you can have a question saying write a computer program that does this and then you can
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:47.480]   compile the answer and test it and see if it actually does it. Math is another area where they
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.880]   could do this because you can write math problems and have the right answer, right? And so they take
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.940]   an already trained foundational model like GPT-4 and they do a tuning step with these type of synthetic
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:02.580]   data sets with right answers where they ask it these questions. And if they give the wrong answer,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.580]   they use reinforcement learning to kind of move its weights away from that. And if it gives a
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:11.120]   right answer, then they use reinforcement learning to make its weights more solidified towards that.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.960]   And they can tune the base language model to be better at these specific tasks for which they
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:22.040]   have big synthetic data sets with examples of right answers. That's what they've been doing since the
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   scaling is not working as well. So they're like, look, this model is good at computer programming.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.340]   Why? They built a huge synthetic data set of computer programming examples. Over here, we have a program
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:37.420]   that's getting really good at math. Why? Well, because we're hiring a bunch of math PhDs and paying them $100 an
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.240]   hour to write all these problems where here's a problem, here's the answer. We're using that to tune
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:47.080]   foundational language model. The reasoning quote unquote advances that came recently was they worked through
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.220]   built out these big synthetic data sets of questions that require reasoning and then step-by-step
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:58.060]   answers. And then they could use that with reinforcement learning to train certain models to be better at like
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.040]   doing something that looked like that type of step-by-step reasoning. So that's
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.980]   what's really going on now. We're not just getting this like massive general increases in
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.200]   overall capability by just scaling compute and data. So instead, the companies are saying,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.940]   we're looking for these like specific applications where we can have these really good synthetic data
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:20.200]   sets. And then we'll build bespoke models that are like better at that particular thing.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:27.120]   And maybe they get worse at other things. So like the latest reasoning tune engine of open AI better
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.440]   match this step-by-step reasoning. They trained it with reinforcement learning, but it hallucinates a lot
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:38.020]   more. Whoops. Because in trying to actually like match that, it like it helps to make things up more
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:44.800]   because you can better like get a logical seeming chain of answer. So the wrong thing to do now is that
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:50.640]   this is not now a general extrapolation. You can't say like, now it's good at math and now it's good at
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.060]   reasoning and now it's good at computer programming. So tomorrow it's going to be good at X. It's like,
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:59.880]   no, no, no. These aren't additive or aggregate. GPT-4 is kind of like their state-of-the-art base
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.440]   model. If you're looking at open AI and they're looking for specific applications where you can get
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.140]   good data sets for reinforcement learning on particular tasks. Now this is producing and will produce
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:14.020]   cool bespoke tools. It's going to be a long product development cycle. You got to figure out places
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:17.860]   where you can build these type of tuned models and then build good software agents around them and
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:22.560]   integrate them into the workflows where people use them. But it's a far cry from the vision that we
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.780]   people had two years ago of like, no, no, just GPT-6 will be anything you ask it. It'll do at a human
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.820]   level. In fact, it can write its own code to make agents around it and we won't even have to like work
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:38.240]   anymore. That is not the trajectory we're on at the moment anymore. Without the scaling laws,
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:43.440]   we have to sort of hand build bespoke models that can do specific tasks where we happen to have data
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.600]   for it. There's many things that we do in our lives where there's not going to be good data sets for,
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.500]   but where there are, I think they're going to eventually have really cool tools. This is a cool
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:58.160]   technology, but it is not on one of these, I have to write an article about the end of business
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.760]   type of trajectories. So anyways, this is like a really important thing that's going on. This is being
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.280]   discussed a lot among like the high executives in these companies, the death of the scaling laws,
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:14.400]   trying to build out these bespoke skills. I mean, so I'll just say real briefly. So why then did we
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:22.960]   have like the AI 2027 report come out last month saying, no, by 2027, these AIs are going to be in
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.420]   charge of everything. And by 2030, humanity might be dead. Well, I look closer at like what was really
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:34.220]   going on there because they know the scaling laws aren't working, right? So what's their tech story for
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:39.200]   for how AI is going to kill humanity in the next like three years, right? If you look closer,
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.840]   it all comes down to a single assumption, which I think is specious. The tuning we're doing for
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.660]   producing computer programs is getting better, which is true like that. We have good data sets for that
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:54.520]   and computer programs are text and we can produce a reasonable size, good computer code.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:01.400]   the foundational assumption of AI 2027 is, well, we're better at computer programming with models
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:06.380]   now than we were before. So maybe if we keep getting better at that in the next year or so,
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:10.720]   the models will just be able to build their own. They'll solve the problem of how to build a more
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.440]   technically advanced AI. Yeah, we can't just scale language models. We don't know the tech story for
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.620]   what type of models would be super powerful or super intelligent, but maybe if we just make them
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:22.520]   better at programming, they'll figure it out in the year 2026 and then we'll be in trouble.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:27.680]   That's a crazy assumption. Anyone who's actually working with the tuning of language models to
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:33.640]   produce computer code to think like, yeah, that's going to lead to giant breakthroughs and architectures
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:41.580]   for artificial intelligence. It's a, it's a crazy claim. It's like saying the Wright brothers being
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:48.000]   like, we've, we just found the new type of propeller and now we can, we can get powered flight. Now it used
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.880]   to just be for a little bit on Kitty Hawk beach. Now we can actually go up and circle the field and come
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.220]   down and do like 10 minute flights. So like, I don't think we're that far away from interstellar
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:01.900]   travel. It's like different. I mean, they're both flying, but it was like completely different levels
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:08.260]   of complexity and challenges. So anyways, this is an important story. I, you know, I'm, I'm increasingly
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:13.280]   believing there's this like weird temperature raising on AI that is becoming more disassociated
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.620]   from the tech story. And so not to talk about AI too much, but this I think is an important story
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:24.100]   understanding that the scaling laws seem to be faltering for language models puts us into a much
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:29.160]   more traditional business innovation cycle landscape for, for AI tools right now.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.900]   All right, there we go. I'm writing a massive, actually it might be out by the time this, this
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.680]   comes out on my newsletter. I'm writing a big AI and work article where I'm just dumping a lot of
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.520]   this stuff I've learned in the one article that I can point people towards. So check that out at
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.240]   newport.com. It should be live when you hear this podcast episode. Nice. I've just been deep on this
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.080]   in a while. I was like, I don't want to keep talking about all the time. Let me just put down like,
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.620]   Hey, here's what I think is going on. And it's an article, at least in the draft that is now,
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.260]   here's the places where like AI is really affecting the world of work. Here's the places where I think
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.320]   it will soon. It hasn't been developed yet, but we'll soon here's some places where it's like a
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.900]   little more hazy, like how exactly is it going to play out, but there could be some cool stuff.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.880]   And here's the stuff that's crazy town. I try to cite a lot of things and make the tech story a little bit
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.120]   clear. So look for that article, calendlyport.com. It should be up. All right. Speaking of which,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.540]   I should probably go work some more on that. So let's call this episode to a close. Thank you all
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:26.920]   for listening back next week with another episode. And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, if you
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.960]   like today's discussion about slowing down in the summer, I think you might also like episode 343,
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:37.820]   where I present a minimal protocol for taking control of your life. It's a great compliment to today's
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:43.120]   discussion. Check it out. I think you'll like it. So one of the conflicts we've confronted here
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.440]   is the one between having too little productivity and too much.
