[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   to our 24th meeting of Intermediate Biblical Counseling.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.080]   And just a joy to be able to gather tonight
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.080]   in this online format and in this online meeting
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.400]   and to continue our study of the word of God.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   We're looking at tonight, theology exam number 24,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.120]   which deals with the subject of the church
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.580]   and the counseling process.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.320]   And so a great topic for us to end our study this year on.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260]   It's been a wonderful time
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.640]   studying the word of God with you
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.680]   these last number of months.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.760]   And by God's grace,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600]   we've made it to the end of the theology exam questions.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.240]   And in January, we will be doing another class
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.480]   dealing with the 20 questions on the counseling exams,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.640]   but that's for 2021.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.000]   I'm just happy to get to the end of the theology exams
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.880]   with all of you.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.660]   And just again, want to thank you for your faithfulness
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.800]   and for your perseverance through this year.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.960]   And thank you for your diligent study of the word of God.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.600]   And it's just been a joy to study these topics with you.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.680]   Well, as I mentioned tonight,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.240]   we're looking at the 24th theology exam question,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   which has to do with the church and the counseling process.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.140]   You'll remember last week,
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.360]   we looked at the doctrine of the church
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.440]   and did a broad survey of what the church is
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.440]   and how the church is spoken of in scripture.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.520]   We saw the different descriptions of the local church
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.880]   in scripture,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.840]   that the church is the very bride and the body of Christ.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.280]   The church is the flock of Christ.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.240]   The church is the family of God.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.680]   And also that the church is the very dwelling place of God,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.600]   the New Testament temple
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.740]   as revealed in the New Testament scriptures.
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.740]   And just a wonderful look at the descriptions of the church
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.220]   as found in the New Testament.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.960]   That was more of a general theological question.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.580]   Describe what the church is
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.240]   and in this question,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.800]   we're going to be looking at
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.920]   how does that relate to actual counseling ministry?
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.080]   How does our view of the local church,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.840]   our ecclesiology, if you will,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   relate to our view of biblical counseling ministry?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.000]   How should we view counseling ministry
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.920]   in light of the doctrine of the local church?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.860]   And you have heard me,
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.820]   if you were in year one of ACBC training with me,
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.140]   year one training,
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.500]   then you have heard me say that counseling
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.460]   is a ministry of the local church
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.500]   and that the best counseling ministry
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.740]   occurs in the local church
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.660]   as an expression of the local church's ministry.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.060]   The best counseling ministry occurs in accountability
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.900]   to the governance structure of the local church.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.840]   The best counseling ministry occurs
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.560]   as the counseling ministry integrates
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.880]   into the life of the local church,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.560]   into the preaching and the teaching ministries of the church
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.600]   as well as into the body life,
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.480]   the one another ministry of the local church.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.300]   And so all of that is really the expression
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.300]   of the core conviction that underlies ACBC's ministry.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.060]   We believe that counseling is a ministry of the local church
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.540]   and that the best counseling that occurs in this world
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.540]   occurs in the context of the local church's ministry.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.580]   That is why I love ACBC as an organization.
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.220]   That is why I am committed to ACBC
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.940]   as a parish church organization
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.780]   that has come alongside the local church
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.900]   and to be a support to the local church.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.580]   ACBC is very clear on its mission
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.940]   and also its core conviction
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.540]   that counseling ministry is to occur
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.300]   as an expression of the local church's ministry.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.340]   So I love ACBC because of its commitment
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.940]   to the sufficiency of scripture for counseling ministry
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.940]   and also for the organization's robust ecclesiology,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.020]   how the ministry of ACBC sees counseling ministry
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.980]   as a ministry of the church.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.500]   So what we're asking you to do in theology exam number 24
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.020]   is to apply the doctrine of the local church
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.980]   that you have studied and articulated in the last exam
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.980]   and apply it to the actual practice of counseling ministry.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.420]   So how does your doctrine of the local church
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.020]   shape and inform how you do counseling?
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.940]   Jesus said in Matthew 16, verse 18,
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.260]   "I will build my church
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.000]   "and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.300]   So we wanna build our counseling ministry
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.680]   not only upon the doctrine of the sufficiency of scripture,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.420]   but also upon the doctrine of the church.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.420]   And so this is a fitting end to a wonderful year of study.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.500]   And I just wanna devote our time of study to the Lord.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.380]   Let's pray together and let's ask the Lord
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.700]   to bless our time.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.860]   Well, Father, we thank you for our time tonight
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.580]   and this hour that we can look at
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.540]   some very precious truths in scripture.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.100]   And we thank you, Father,
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.080]   that tonight we are looking at a topic
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.440]   that is really near and dear to the heart of Christ.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.860]   Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.060]   The church is the very bride in the body of Christ
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.700]   bought with the blood of Christ.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.300]   And it is the church that is the organization,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.020]   the organism that is being built into a spiritual temple
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.900]   in this, the New Testament era.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.980]   And we thank you for the promise
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.740]   that Christ will build his church
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.960]   and the gates of hell shall not stand against it.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.700]   We thank you for the ministry of the church.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.620]   We thank you for the preaching
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.180]   and the teaching ministry of the church.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.300]   We thank you for the fellowship of the church.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.860]   We thank you for the ordinances of the church,
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.140]   the Lord's table and baptism.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.740]   We thank you for the mission of the church,
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.820]   which is to make disciples of all the nations,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.660]   baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.860]   and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.420]   And we just thank you for the privilege
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.100]   of not only belonging to Christ,
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.320]   but also the privilege of belonging to the church.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.860]   We pray that you would make us men and women
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.860]   who love the church, who are committed to the church
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.980]   and who express our counseling ministry
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.460]   as an extension of the local church's ministry.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.560]   Help us to be committed to the churches
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.520]   that we are a part of.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.760]   And we pray that Father, you would use this session
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   to help us to think through the practical implications
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.060]   of this truth, that counseling ministry
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.380]   is a ministry of the church.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.620]   And so we just thank you for this time,
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.400]   we commit it to you in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.860]   - Amen, well, let's read together Theology Exam number 24.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.880]   And the question is, what role should the church play
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.300]   in the counseling process?
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.780]   And so a number of good resources that I've listed for you
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.040]   on page one of your handout, the works by Wayne Grudem,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.480]   Paul Toczkis and Heath Lambert,
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.560]   as well as David Powelson's article
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.040]   in the Journal of Biblical Counseling.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.600]   All of those are very good resources
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.900]   that will help you think through this topic
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.640]   of how a counseling is a ministry of the local church.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.220]   I also wanna commend to you the additional resources
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.640]   that I've placed on your handout
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.520]   and a really good blog post on this topic
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.560]   was written by Dr. Robert Jones,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.800]   who was my professor at Southern Seminary.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.360]   He has thought through this topic of church-based
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.120]   and church-centered biblical counseling ministry
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.540]   in some detail.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.320]   And there's a part one as well as a part two
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.920]   to that blog post that's found
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   at the Biblical Counseling Coalition website.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   A very helpful work.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.960]   And I'm gonna go over some of his comments
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.200]   through the course of this session,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.920]   but I did want to quote from his blog post for a moment.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.400]   This isn't on your handout,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.200]   but I'll just put it on the screen here.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.700]   And he writes, "I love church-based counseling.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.960]   Having done it for 30 years now,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   19 as a lead pastor and the past 11 as an associate,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.980]   I can assure you that there is nothing better
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.920]   than counseling in the context of a healthy local church.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.000]   By church-based counseling, I mean, Christ-centered,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.380]   biblical counseling provided for the members
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.960]   and visitors of a local church
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.080]   done by the trained leaders and members of that church
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.000]   with the goal of helping those members
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.520]   and visitors follow Christ
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   and function as growing members of that congregation."
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.020]   And I love his definition of church-based counseling.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.020]   It is Christ-centered biblical counseling
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   provided for the members and visitors of a local church.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.980]   Dr. Jones continues that,
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.220]   "While I thank the Lord for my brothers and sisters
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.340]   who counsel biblically as much as they're permitted to
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.620]   in para-church settings, private practice offices,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.820]   and institutional settings,
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.300]   and I recognize their place in God's kingdom,
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.800]   none of those scenarios offers the depth and breadth of care
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   that a sound biblical counseling church can provide."
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.380]   And I would agree with that assessment.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.380]   He talks about how counseling ministry
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.340]   as an expression of the local church
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.760]   is able to integrate its ministry
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.300]   into all of the different ministries of the local church
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.020]   and therefore offers to a counselee
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.800]   what no standalone practice could offer.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.820]   And I think as you'll see by the end of this session,
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.860]   I hope you will see how that is practically true.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.040]   And I like the balance in this.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.060]   We're not against para-church settings
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.940]   or private practice offices.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.640]   We're not against institutional settings.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.800]   We are not known for what we are against
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.380]   so much as what we are for.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.920]   We are for a high view of the local church
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.420]   and a high view of the sufficiency of scripture.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.440]   So that's just a very helpful blog
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.860]   that I would encourage you to read
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.260]   and think through on your own.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.640]   I would encourage you for your essay purposes
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.560]   that if you were to take three or four
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.080]   of the 13 statements there,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.680]   the 13 benefits of church-based biblical counseling
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.520]   and do your own reflection on that topic
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.560]   and even think through some benefits on your own
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.080]   and incorporate that into your theology exam,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.680]   that would very much enrich your theology exam
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.160]   and really provide some material
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.800]   to write on this essay topic.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.040]   Just a very helpful resource.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.640]   And then on your handout there,
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.800]   I would highly recommend to you
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.360]   Milton Vincent's seminar,
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.640]   "Abounding in Hope and Able to Counsel."
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.320]   That was recorded at the IBCD conference
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.520]   and I had the privilege of sitting in on that seminar
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.480]   and just one of the best one-hour seminars
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.280]   that I have heard on the topic
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.200]   of church-based biblical counseling
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.840]   and how the believer is able to counsel
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   because he or she has the full revelation of the gospel
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.280]   as recorded in the book of Romans
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.960]   as well as in the Old Testament
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.320]   and New Testament scriptures.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.680]   So please get your hands on that seminar
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.000]   and refer to those notes.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.280]   That is a very helpful work
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.320]   that will help you think through this topic.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.200]   And then a couple of blog posts there,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.760]   Ed Welch and Paul Toshkis have some good material
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.080]   on counseling one another
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.000]   as a ministry of the local church
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   and the ministry of church discipline in the local church,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.840]   which is, as we shall see,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   related to the counseling ministry in some degree.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.260]   So let me move to page two of your handout
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.040]   and let's talk through the role of the church
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.840]   in counseling ministry.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.640]   What do we mean by the church being central
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.960]   in counseling ministry?
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.080]   And what do we mean by church-based
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.440]   and church-centered counseling ministry?
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.740]   Well, the main idea that we're communicating
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.300]   in this session is simply this,
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.540]   that biblical counseling is a ministry of the local church.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.040]   Biblical counseling is a ministry of the local church.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   And at the risk of overstating the obvious,
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.640]   we want to promote a church-centered view
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.160]   of biblical counseling.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.880]   It was back in 1970 when Jay Adams published
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.260]   his landmark work entitled "Competent to Counsel."
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.440]   And in that day, Adams was responding to this idea
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.020]   that the church has a lot to offer
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.540]   in terms of biblical teaching
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.560]   and the church is tasked to evangelize the world.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.400]   But when it comes to life's problems
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.360]   and helping people with the issues of life,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.200]   the church did not have the resources to do that ministry
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.020]   and needed to refer their members outside of the church
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.700]   into the secular world.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.000]   And the church needed to tell its members
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.560]   to receive help from secular psychologists.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.100]   That was the prominent idea in Adams' day.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.280]   And he wrote this landmark work, "Competent to Counsel."
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.060]   The fundamental conviction that Adams promoted in his book
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.960]   was that the church was indeed able to counsel
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.320]   and had the resources to help people with their problems.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.880]   And Adams based his conviction
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.140]   off the teaching of Romans 15, verse 14,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.120]   where Paul says, "I myself am satisfied about you,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.180]   "my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness,
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.460]   "filled with all knowledge,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.280]   "and able or competent to instruct."
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.320]   The Greek word is nutheteo, to admonish.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.840]   It could be translated to counsel.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.460]   You are able to instruct one another.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.800]   And that term, nutheteo, became the basis
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   for the counseling movement, nuthetic counseling.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.840]   That term is derived from the Greek term
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.120]   used in Romans 15, verse 14.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   The term nutheteo is used in Colossians 3, verse 16,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.520]   where Paul says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.720]   "richly, teaching," and nutheteo, admonishing,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.960]   "one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.780]   "and spiritual songs with thankfulness
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.160]   "in your hearts to God."
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.380]   And Adams said in that work
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.380]   that the task of nutheteo belongs to those members
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.480]   in the local church.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.840]   He wrote that the thesis of this book
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.800]   is that qualified Christian counselors,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.480]   properly trained in the scriptures,
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.240]   are competent to counsel,
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   more competent than psychiatrists or anyone else.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.300]   And that is the fundamental conviction
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.660]   that launched the biblical counseling movement.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.520]   It was a radical idea back in 1970,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.520]   and it continues to be a radical idea even today.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.240]   Believers are able to counsel.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.360]   The problems that are addressed by secular psychology
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.960]   are the very same problems
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.280]   that are addressed by the scriptures.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.960]   And this ministry of admonishing one another,
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.920]   speaking the truth to one another,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.560]   belongs as a ministry of the church.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   The term nutheteo comes from the Greek words
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.940]   nous, meaning mind, and tithimi, meaning to place.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.640]   It literally can be translated to place in the mind.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.320]   And the idea there is to lay it on the mind
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.840]   or the heart of a person
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.920]   with a view towards a change in conduct.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.040]   Nutheteo could be described as the ministry
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.700]   of putting sense into someone's head.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.760]   So that's what we do in counseling ministry.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.120]   We speak the truth in love,
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.600]   and we seek to bring biblical truth
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.320]   to bear upon people's lives
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.260]   through helpful conversations
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.260]   with a view towards a change of belief and conduct.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.180]   You'll note there that Paul simply includes
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.440]   that ministry of admonishing one another
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   as the one-anothering that occurs in the local church.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.400]   There are 59 one-anothers in the scripture,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.540]   59 commands that call us into the fellowship
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.200]   of the local church and call us to build relationships
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.800]   in the local church.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.120]   A sampling on your hand out there,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.720]   love one another, live in harmony with one another,
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.240]   welcome one another, care for one another,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.000]   greet one another, through love serve one another,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.440]   bear one another's burdens
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.240]   and so fulfill the law of Christ,
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.000]   encourage one another, build one another up,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.960]   pray for one another, exhort one another,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.680]   and you can add to that list,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.480]   newt the tale or admonish one another,
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   speak truth into one another's lives.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.920]   All of those commands taken together
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.320]   bring to bear upon our lives
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.740]   and our understanding of the Christian life
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.960]   that we cannot live our Christian lives
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   in isolation from relationships in the local church.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.160]   And so counseling ministry is meant to work in conjunction
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.280]   with all of the other one-another commands in scripture.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.320]   We counsel one another as we pray for one another.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.040]   We counsel one another as we care for one another.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.120]   We counsel one another as we greet one another.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.340]   There's been many times in my own counseling ministry
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.520]   where I have the joy of meeting with a counselee
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.920]   in a counseling room on a Thursday morning
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.160]   or a Thursday evening,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.280]   and then have the opportunity to greet that counselee
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.520]   on a Sunday morning at the counseling
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.840]   during the worship service.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   We operate in conjunction with the ministry
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.760]   of the local church.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.360]   And so we counsel one another as we exhort one another
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.040]   and as we encourage one another.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.880]   So this is why we wanna encourage you
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.120]   to have a broad view of counseling ministry
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.960]   as well as a narrow view of counseling ministry.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.920]   The broad view of counseling ministry
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.920]   is that counseling happens all the time.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.800]   Counseling happens in coffee shops.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.120]   It happens in living rooms.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.500]   It happens at breakfast at Denny's or at Flappy Jacks.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   It happens as you text or as you call one another
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.960]   or FaceTime one another.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.640]   It happens in small group meetings.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.080]   It happens after a worship service
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.160]   at as you eat donuts with other believers in Christ.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   Counseling happens all the time in the conversations
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.920]   that you and I have on a weekly daily basis
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.960]   where we share life together with other believers in Christ.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.720]   That's the broad view of counseling ministry.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.560]   And then there is a narrow aspect of counseling ministry
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.760]   where counseling happens in structured counseling sessions
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.160]   that are in an office or in a counseling room
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.400]   in which you organize 12 to 15 sessions
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   and walk through a very specific issue of life.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.040]   There is a broad aspect and there is a narrow aspect.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.880]   And one of the benefits of the certification process
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.560]   is you get better at the narrow aspect
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.240]   of counseling ministry.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.080]   And guess what?
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.600]   That makes you better at the broader aspects
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.720]   of counseling ministry.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.520]   If you can do 12 to 15 sessions with a counselee
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.320]   dealing with an intense issue of life,
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.800]   then you will be able to handle that conversation
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.920]   at Flappy Jacks or at Starbucks or wherever you may be.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   And so counseling ministry is the ministry of the church
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.620]   happening all the time in the church.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.120]   So Adams asked this question.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.900]   Why would we go outside the church
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.680]   when addressing the real problems and issues of life?
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.360]   I'll just reason theologically for a moment.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.600]   If the church is the very body and the bride of Christ,
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.880]   if the church is the very flock
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.240]   that belongs to the shepherd who is Christ,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.200]   if the flock is the family of God,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.140]   if it is the dwelling place of God
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.420]   in which the spirit of God dwells
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.320]   and empowers effective ministry,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.800]   then why would you forfeit all of the benefits
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.920]   and the blessings that belong to the church
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.040]   and send your people outside of the church
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.240]   to address the problems and the issues of life?
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.080]   We're not against the idea of medication.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.920]   We're not against the idea of,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.280]   at some point, partnering with a physician.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.040]   We're not against some of the insights
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.220]   that secular psychology has to offer
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.840]   in terms of how people behave.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.920]   Even J. Adams noted that secular psychology
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   makes good and helpful observations about human behavior.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.300]   And so we wanna be balanced with this,
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:59.180]   and we're not anti all of these other things
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.540]   that go on in the world.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.680]   What we are saying as we are affirming
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.220]   the sufficiency of scripture
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.600]   and the centrality of the church
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.440]   and the plan and program of God
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   is that ministry belongs to the church,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.660]   that lives are changed as the scriptures
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.840]   are brought to bear upon people's lives,
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.480]   and that the counseling issues
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.560]   that you and I face in the world today
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.040]   are issues that are addressed by the scriptures
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.440]   and can be addressed in the local church.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.600]   And so this was Adam's statement
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.760]   and the one that launched the biblical counseling movement.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.800]   Now, with that said,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.520]   let me move to page three of your handout
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.600]   and just talk through some practical implications of this.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.320]   The key passage, as we noted,
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   that Adams entitled his landmark work after
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.200]   is Romans 15, verse 14, where Paul says,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.640]   "I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers,"
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.560]   that means Christians,
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.280]   "that you yourselves are full of goodness,"
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.800]   and that word talks about practical help
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.820]   or practical benefit,
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.800]   "that you are filled with all knowledge,"
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.280]   which refers to the knowledge of the gospel,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.200]   the knowledge of Christ,
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.900]   the knowledge of all the doctrines
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.000]   that he has spoken of in the book of Romans,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.360]   the knowledge of the truths of justification by faith alone,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.440]   the knowledge of the truth of glorification,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.320]   which will occur at some time in the future.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.720]   You are filled with all of this spiritual knowledge,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.960]   the knowledge of Christ,
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.400]   the knowledge of the truth of God.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.200]   You're full of goodness
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.120]   because you are filled with practical help
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   based upon your knowledge of Christ and his word.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.600]   And therefore, Paul says,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.920]   "I'm satisfied about you,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   and you are able to newt the tale to instruct one another."
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.040]   And he just makes the statement
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.000]   that the believer is competent to counsel,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.560]   that we should not be intimidated
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   by those who have some professional certification.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.520]   We should understand that
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.300]   if we have been given the scriptures
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.000]   and given the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.840]   that we are able to give instruction from God's word.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.760]   And this statement is expounded upon
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.360]   by Milton Vincent in his excellent seminar,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.060]   "Abounding in Hope and Able to Counsel."
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.440]   And what Pastor Milton does in that seminar
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.160]   is he notes that it appears
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.440]   that even in the realm of secular psychology,
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.360]   that different models of secular psychology,
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.060]   different methods of psychotherapy
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.060]   do have some limited temporal benefit.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.400]   He notes there that there seems to be,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.440]   and this is just kind of a broad observation,
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.120]   that when a person, even an unbeliever,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.280]   goes to see a secular psychologist or a secular therapist,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   there is some limited benefit of a temporal nature.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.960]   And he also notes there that it appears
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.760]   that it doesn't seem to matter
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   what the content of that therapy
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:52.160]   is in the actual delivery of a theory
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.240]   that addresses the person's issues.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.080]   It doesn't seem to matter what the content is,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.760]   what the common thread that surrounds the limited benefit
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.280]   that people receive from secular psychology
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   seems to be a live person who seems to care
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.700]   or expresses some kind of care
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.700]   that devotes a certain amount of time to a specific person,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.840]   that the common denominator
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   behind how people receive help from secular psychology
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.760]   doesn't seem to be the exact model
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.560]   or the exact theories being espoused
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.680]   in the counseling delivery,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.640]   but it is just, there's a person to talk to,
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.200]   and that person appears to care,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.620]   and that person gives attention,
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.760]   and that person, for at least a structured amount of time,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   devotes himself or herself to addressing your problems.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:01.240]   After doing this survey of secular psychology,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.040]   Vincent makes this statement
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.640]   that I think is very helpful for us to think through.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   He says, "If the common ingredient
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.160]   that makes all models of psychotherapy
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.360]   at least somewhat helpful is a caring human being
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.600]   who is willing to listen and talk and help,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.120]   then the church should be a dynamic place
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.800]   that is bristling with power to help people.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.920]   Those of us who have been saved by Christ
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.180]   are called to be quick to listen and slow to talk,
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.480]   and when we talk, we speak the truth in love,
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.520]   and the truth we speak is the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.780]   which is the power of God into salvation
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.920]   to everyone who believes."
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.080]   Just a balanced view there of secular psychology
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.520]   and how it would contrast
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.780]   with the church's counseling ministry.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.240]   Vincent knows that it seems that even secular psychology
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   can be somewhat helpful in some limited temporal sense
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.100]   because there is a live person
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.660]   who is caring for another person,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.240]   and if that is true under common grace,
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.200]   then how much more under saving grace
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.160]   should the church be a dynamic place
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.200]   that is bristling with power to help other people?
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.640]   For we offer not only a caring person
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.840]   who is devoted to help another person,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.040]   but we also offer the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.480]   and the truth of the scriptures
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.440]   and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.360]   How much more ought the church to be a place
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.020]   that is abounding in hope
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.060]   and is filled with believers
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.000]   who are equipped to counsel others
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.920]   and to give them the life-changing truths of scripture?
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:03.000]   If the world can produce a minimal level of helpfulness
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.400]   under common grace,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.680]   how much more ought the church to be a place
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.720]   that is filled with life-changing counsel
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.480]   under saving grace?
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.240]   For we offer people not only a caring human being,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.820]   but a Christ-like spirit-filled counseling ministry
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.560]   that is empowered by the scriptures
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.320]   and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.640]   And so Paul says here,
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.320]   you are able to instruct one another.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.740]   William Henderson has made this comment,
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.940]   "Today the word counseling is heard again and again.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.720]   Ever so many books and articles
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.900]   have been written about it.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.260]   The apostle here reveals
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.900]   that there was a mutual counseling already in his day.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.260]   And it was of a high character.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.500]   By and large, the members of the Roman church
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   were competent to admonish one another."
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.340]   And I love Ed Welch's statement
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.660]   in towards the middle of page three.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.860]   He says, "No longer do people need a special anointing
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.060]   to offer a prophetic word of direction and wisdom.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.020]   Now we are part of the new covenant
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.940]   in which the spirit has been given to all
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.580]   who have put their faith in Jesus.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.780]   God is pleased to have the church mature
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.480]   through the ministry of weak people
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.820]   who seem unqualified in the world's eyes.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.220]   Most likely this is already happening in your church.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.900]   People share their struggles with each other.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.940]   People pray with each other.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.340]   This is certainly happening with the women in the church.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.020]   Sometimes it is happening with the men.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.620]   We want it to happen more and with growing love and wisdom."
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.140]   And here is Welch's definition of biblical counseling.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.140]   He says, "Counseling is wise and helpful conversations."
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.580]   That is counseling.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.220]   I like that definition.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.260]   Wise and helpful conversations in surrounding God's word
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.420]   and relating it to life.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.420]   He says, "We all need this and need to give it."
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.620]   This is a view of counseling ministry that is,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.860]   again, was radical in 1970 and that is still radical today.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   So with that said, let me move to page four of your handout.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.580]   And what I wanna do is actually segue a little bit
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.540]   into a brief overview of Robert Jones's blog,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.580]   his "13 Benefits of Church-Based Biblical Counseling."
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.060]   As I thought about this subject,
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.260]   I thought that Jones does a fantastic job
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.660]   of just giving an overview or a big picture
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.180]   of what does church-based counseling ministry look like.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.340]   And I wanna do a brief overview of that here
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.420]   and then come back to page four of your handout
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.820]   and then highlight a few of these benefits
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.200]   in greater detail.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.700]   But as I mentioned, you would do well to reflect
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.340]   on these benefits on your own and perhaps use them
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.340]   as a prompt to write your own thoughts on this issue.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.140]   But the question would be,
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.020]   what are the benefits of church-based counseling
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.380]   as opposed to counseling,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.580]   which is done outside of the local church
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.580]   or even counseling that is done as a standalone ministry?
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.140]   And just run through these.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.500]   I think you'll get the big picture
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.320]   and this will be helpful to think through this topic.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.780]   But number one would be the direct oversight
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.700]   of God-ordained shepherds.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.580]   And he's referring there to the elders
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.900]   and the pastors of the local church.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.980]   Here at Kindred Church,
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.180]   our counseling ministries operates underneath the authority
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.980]   of the elders and pastors of the church.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.460]   We are accountable to the governance structure
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.540]   of the local church.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.380]   And that is a healthy accountability that I rejoice in
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.020]   and I thank God for.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.060]   We have tremendous benefits that flow
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.380]   out of this accountability to the elders
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.180]   and the pastors of the local church.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.940]   This keeps us as a ministry theologically grounded.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.860]   We are accountable to the doctrinal statement of our church.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   We are accountable to the bylaws of our local church.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.900]   And it not only keeps our counseling ministry accountable,
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.540]   it keeps our counselors accountable
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.380]   that they must be accountable as to their doctrine
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.340]   and as to their conduct in the local church.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:01.300]   We seek to affirm counselors as ACBC certified counselors
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.340]   who have a good reputation in the local church.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.580]   And this is a question ACBC asks us as pastors
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:14.380]   to answer regarding our counselors on a yearly basis
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.620]   is what is your counselor's reputation in the local church?
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.900]   And that's for the simple reason
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.500]   that we don't want to affirm biblical counselors
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.580]   who have poor reputations in the local church.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.300]   And I thank God for the counselors in my ministry
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.620]   and just thank God that each of them
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.260]   have stellar reputations in the local church
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.020]   and they have built up those reputations
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.700]   over years of faithful service in the church.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:50.460]   So the first benefit would be the direct oversight
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.620]   of God ordained shepherds.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.780]   A second benefit would be consistency
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.740]   between private counseling and the public preaching
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.580]   and teaching of God's word.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.900]   This would be the idea that we want our counselees
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.140]   to be not only coming for counseling,
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.020]   but also to be sitting in worship service
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:16.300]   on a Sunday morning, hearing the word of God proclaimed.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.780]   We want them to be in essence hearing the same thing
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.820]   on a Sunday morning in a group setting
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.820]   that they are hearing in an individual meeting
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.820]   during the week.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.220]   It is the partnership of this public ministry of God's word
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.380]   and the private ministry of God's word
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:40.380]   that produces life change in the counselees life.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.620]   And so counselees need to hear both preaching,
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.620]   Caruso ministry and counseling, Nutheteo ministry.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:55.700]   And it's helpful when both of those ministries
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:01.300]   are coming from the same doctrinal viewpoint.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.340]   It's helpful when this isn't always the case
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.380]   in counseling ministry because we do counsel people
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.700]   who are coming from different churches,
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.700]   but it is helpful when the counselee is hearing
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.380]   from the pulpit, a high view of the authority of scripture
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.900]   and then hearing the same doctrinal viewpoint
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.260]   in the counseling ministry that there's consistency
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:27.260]   between private and public ministry of God's word.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:32.300]   Oftentimes an ideal setting is my counselee
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.140]   is sitting in a worship service on Sunday morning,
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.140]   hearing the preaching of God's word.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.660]   And then even we can bring into the counseling session
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.980]   applications of Sunday's message to the specific issue
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.100]   that the counselee is facing.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.700]   I've been surprised and amazed at how many times
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.380]   the Sunday morning message is directly relevant
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.380]   to what my counselee is going through in his life.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.700]   And so that is a very helpful partnership
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.700]   between public preaching and private counseling.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:13.420]   Number three would be God-centered Christ-exalting worship.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.540]   Just note here that you're not gonna get this
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.840]   in a standalone counseling session,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.900]   but getting your counselee involved
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.340]   on a Sunday morning worship service
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.820]   gets them exposed to the corporate worship of the church
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.460]   and they're exposed to
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.700]   God-centered Christ-exalting worship.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.920]   Now, why is this helpful in counseling ministry?
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.180]   It's helpful because as we have learned
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.380]   in the fundamentals of biblical counseling,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.300]   the deepest heart issues are always theological
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   and the deepest heart issues are always related to worship.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.300]   Who or what do we worship as the Puritans used to put it?
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:06.300]   Who do we give our ultimate allegiance and affections?
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.740]   One of the counselors in our ministry was commenting
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.420]   that the common thread seems to be
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:19.420]   that the heart issues deal with idolatry and unbelief.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.260]   Those are the dominant heart issues
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.100]   that come up in counseling.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.420]   And I would agree with that assessment
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.900]   that usually at the deepest heart level
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.780]   of a counselee's life,
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.260]   there are issues related to unbelief and idolatry
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.860]   that the counselee is worshiping or worth shipping
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   something other than the true and the living God.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.540]   How do you deal with these matters of the heart?
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:54.900]   How do you deal with idolatry and worship issues?
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.500]   Well, you have to get the counselee
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.180]   into the corporate worship of the church
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:04.180]   and you have to get them exposed to corporate worship.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.380]   God-centered Christ exalting worship
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.380]   has a wonderful way of addressing the counseling issues
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.900]   that we are facing.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.940]   Jones even writes that this comment
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.100]   is a little tongue in cheek,
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.180]   but the idea is good.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.020]   He writes and I quote that a biblical counseling church
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.580]   offers two counseling sessions every week,
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:33.220]   a kind of Sunday morning group therapy time
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.500]   for an assembly of recovering idolaters
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.700]   and then a private session during the week.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:44.140]   He says that's a little bit of a humorous observation,
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.700]   but the idea is good.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.680]   You need both the group meeting of a Sunday morning
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.700]   and also the private meeting with a counselor.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.700]   Number four would be Christ's ordinances of baptism
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.780]   and the Lord's supper,
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.820]   which are some of the most powerful moments
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.100]   in the life of a church.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.460]   I've had the privilege of administrating the baptisms
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.940]   here at Kindred Church for the last five years
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.740]   and also been involved in leading the Lord's supper
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.740]   and just a tremendous joy to be part of these ordinances.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.040]   It never gets old.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.120]   In fact, these ordinances grow more and more meaningful
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.420]   as the years go by.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.440]   And the truth is that some of our counselees
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.200]   do need to be baptized.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.940]   And part of the counseling process
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.600]   is to instruct them in the ordinance of baptism
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.340]   and just to let them know that that is the first
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.600]   and most simplest commandment that Jesus gives
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.160]   to a believer in Christ.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.400]   And we can't progress to the greater commandments
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.860]   if we don't obey Christ in the first
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   and simplest commandment, which is to be baptized.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.320]   We've had people in our church say that,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.860]   well, I wanna work with children
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.760]   or I wanna be involved in working with youth,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.560]   but I haven't been baptized and I don't plan to be baptized.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.400]   And our response is, if you're not willing to be obedient
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.100]   to the most basic command in the Christian life,
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.280]   then how can we entrust children
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.500]   to your spiritual influence?
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.180]   What indeed are you going to teach our children
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:29.920]   that the word of God does not need to be obeyed?
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.580]   That's not the message we want our children to hear.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.340]   So we just encourage people to be baptized
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.420]   and to partake of the Lord's table.
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.840]   And sometimes there have been occasions
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.800]   where we will instruct our counselees to be baptized
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   as part of the counseling process,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.700]   that this is actually going to be helpful for you
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.480]   to grow in sanctification if you obey Christ
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.340]   in this very important ordinance.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.360]   A fifth benefit would be formative and restorative
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.320]   or redemptive church discipline.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.200]   I have some material on that subject in your handout,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.900]   but I'll just mention it here.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.920]   When and if we have a counselee
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.380]   who's caught in unrepentant sin
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.520]   and is unwilling to repent and deal with that sin issue,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.200]   then a church-based counseling ministry has a recourse
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.600]   to bring that to the next stage of church discipline
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.920]   and to bring some of that spiritual pressure
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.960]   upon the counselee's life.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.880]   Now, I thank God that at least in the last five years
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.320]   of my ministry here at Kindred
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.000]   and in the Kindred Counseling Center,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.460]   we have not had to discipline any counselee
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.280]   that comes in for church discipline
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.760]   and or comes in for counseling ministry.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.260]   No one comes in for church discipline,
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.320]   but they come in for counseling ministry.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.800]   We have not had to institute church discipline
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.520]   for any of our counselees as of yet.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.680]   And so I do wanna be balanced with this.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.480]   We don't wanna train counselors
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.000]   who are always threatening their counselees
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.640]   with church discipline if they don't do their homework
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.880]   or if they don't show up on time
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.800]   or if they don't make radical change in a week or two.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.280]   That's not the tone that we wanna set.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:21.440]   The rule is patience and long-suffering
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.120]   and waiting for the counselee
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.720]   to take those steps towards obedience.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.900]   But there is a framework, however,
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.440]   and there is an accountability structure in place
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.120]   that we operate as a ministry of the local church
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.040]   and therefore we do have the right,
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.560]   if we have a situation where there is blatant,
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.760]   unrepentant sin that's not being repented of
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.840]   or not being dealt with,
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.780]   then we do have recourse to bring the pressure
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.320]   of church discipline upon that situation.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.280]   And all of that is recorded
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.920]   in our consent to counsel documents.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   And that, by the way, is a very helpful accountability
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:08.960]   to live under that we do live in a local church
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.000]   that practices church discipline.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.400]   Number six would be the fellowship, encouragement,
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.580]   an example of mature fellow believers.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.280]   We can actually assign as homework
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.980]   to ask a counselee to join a small group.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.640]   We can even get really specific in our homework assignments
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.480]   that some of our counselors have even gotten so specific
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.160]   as to say to our counselee,
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.720]   "We want you to join a small group
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.600]   "and then we want you to stay after the small group,
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.000]   "the formal time ends,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.980]   "and we want you to stay during the snack time
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.680]   "and talk to two to three people,
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.020]   "ask them what their prayer requests are."
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.380]   You can get that very specific in counseling ministry
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.540]   as part of the homework to get people involved
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.720]   in the fellowship of the local church
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.900]   and just bring that resource to bear
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.420]   upon the counselee's life.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.520]   We've just noted this,
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.680]   that the two things that are very common
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.500]   in counseling ministry is one,
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.660]   our counselees are not reading the word of God
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.400]   on a daily basis.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.280]   And number two, they're just living isolated lives,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.460]   that they don't have relationships in the local church.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.500]   And so if we can assign homework
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.760]   that will help them to get into the word of God
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.140]   on a daily basis,
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.560]   and then get into the flow of relationships
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.620]   and fellowship in the local church,
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.100]   we will have helped them build the foundations
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:39.220]   of their spiritual life.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.880]   And many counselees,
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.540]   just from those two items being dealt with in their lives
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.980]   do grow in their counseling issue.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.660]   Even if we haven't addressed the specific issue
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.200]   of anxiety or anger or conflict resolution,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.180]   just getting them into the word on a daily basis,
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.340]   getting them into fellowship
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   brings tremendous spiritual benefits to their lives.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.420]   And so that is another benefit.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.120]   Number seven would be existing facilities and office space.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.320]   As a related note,
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:16.080]   a church-based counseling ministry is ideally funded
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.520]   by the offerings of the members of the church.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.560]   And so typically we offer our ministry for free.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.460]   I'm always, I'm often asked the question,
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.360]   do we do this as a paid ministry
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   or can we expect to make money off counseling ministry
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.240]   in the church?
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.120]   And typically my basic response is,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.000]   it's similar to the public ministry of God's word.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.440]   We don't charge for people to come
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.640]   and hear the word of God on a Sunday morning.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.760]   We don't charge admission for people to do that.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.280]   Even though what we offer them
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.080]   in the preaching of God's word is invaluable.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.580]   We're not charging tickets.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:04.580]   We're not selling tickets to come and hear the word of God
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.200]   on a Sunday morning.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.660]   And similarly with private ministry of God's word,
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.080]   we don't charge for our counseling ministry.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.020]   At times with non-members,
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:18.040]   we might give a suggested donation
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.320]   to the counseling ministry.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.240]   And definitely if a counselee feels led
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.600]   to give a freewill offering out of gratitude
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.200]   to what they have received in counseling,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.680]   we certainly encourage them to do that.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.960]   And we certainly will receive that offering,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.760]   but that's a different motivational structure
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.560]   than if a counseling ministry charges
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.820]   for its counseling ministry.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.980]   And I know there's a little bit of differing perspectives,
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.560]   even in the biblical counseling world
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.840]   on this particular subject,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.480]   but just to let you know where I've landed
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.160]   after many discussions on this is,
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.640]   I just kind of landed with an understanding
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.080]   that if we don't charge
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.680]   for the public ministry of God's word,
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.720]   then generally speaking,
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.000]   I'm comfortable with a view of counseling that says,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.820]   we don't charge for the private ministry of God's word.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:15.060]   And on a practical note, if we did charge,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:18.740]   that would introduce a lot of different complexities
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.340]   as to how we would have to set up our ministry.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.940]   And I would rather avoid that if possible,
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.820]   but you can use existing facilities
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.180]   and use existing resources of the local church
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.900]   and not have to pay additional overhead
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.960]   where you have to go to a financial model
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.700]   of charging for counseling ministry.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.600]   And so as a side note,
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.120]   most of our counselors do this as a ministry.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.320]   They're not paid for their service.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.840]   They're not paid for counseling
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.640]   just as they would not be paid
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.680]   for serving as a deacon or deaconess
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.480]   or serving in the welcome tent
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.920]   or serving as an usher.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.600]   For the majority of our counselors,
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.860]   this is a labor of love.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.460]   There may be a place for a highly dedicated counselor
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.000]   who is giving significant amounts of time and energy
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.660]   to the counseling ministry to be given a stipend
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.500]   or to be supported in some way,
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.700]   but that would be at the discretion of the elders
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.620]   and the pastors of the church.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.820]   Generally, our counselors are doing this as a ministry
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.520]   and as a service to Christ.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.420]   And then there is letter number eight,
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.840]   immediate opportunities to serve others,
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.400]   which would be also a suggested assignment
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.020]   that you can give to counselees.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.700]   It's just many of our counselees
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:52.140]   have a very self-focused view of their lives
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.460]   and we need to pull them out of that
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.860]   and help them to see others in the body of Christ.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.620]   And you can assign them homework
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.500]   that gets them into service.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:06.580]   Number nine would be resource people for auxiliary help.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.660]   I can think of one counselee
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.820]   that without getting into details,
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.740]   I had one counseling situation
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.380]   where there were financial issues
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.140]   and I was able to ask the counselee,
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.820]   can I bring in another person in the church
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.260]   who has expertise in this very,
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.620]   in the specific financial issue that you're dealing with
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.220]   and have them speak into the situation
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.020]   and was able to get the consent of the counselee on that.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:38.220]   And that led to a wonderful partnership
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.860]   of having someone in our church
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.060]   minister to the counselee alongside myself.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.060]   And those are some of the opportunities
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.540]   that exist in a local church setting
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:54.220]   that may not exist in a standalone counseling center.
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.540]   Number 10 would be benevolence assistance,
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.100]   financial help or physical labor.
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.060]   Our church does have a benevolence fund
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.460]   that's meant to help members with financial needs.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.420]   And we have partnered with that ministry
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.740]   in the counseling ministry of the church.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.940]   Number 11 would be members homes for counseling,
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.140]   discipleship and small group life.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:22.260]   We've seen that some of our counselors,
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.300]   it's like the, when Paul left the church at Ephesus
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:32.820]   and the church, they asked Paul not to go.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.820]   And some of our counselees become friends in the ministry.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.540]   The formal aspects of counseling
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.740]   lead to a longer relationship.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.500]   And that's a joy to see.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.300]   That doesn't always happen, but sometimes it does.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.900]   And that's a wonderful thing to see
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.420]   when we see the formal aspect of ministry
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   lead to informal ministry and informal relationships.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:05.140]   There is the aspect of a greater legal protection.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.300]   When you define your counseling ministry
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.620]   as a ministry of the local church,
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:13.260]   and just define it as a ministry that is accountable
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.140]   to the doctrinal statement of the church,
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:21.140]   then there is legal protection there
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.860]   that whatever protections apply to the church as a whole
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.780]   can be claimed by the counseling ministry
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.140]   as part of that larger structure.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.020]   And so there are some benefits of that
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.540]   that I could take time to explain,
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.340]   but my time is limited here.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.820]   But to say that there is some legal protection
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.900]   and defining it that way.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.100]   And then Jones notes,
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.540]   we offer all of the above free of charge.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.140]   Jones concludes this,
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:55.140]   that truly given this baker's dozen of benefits,
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:02.500]   the local church remains God's ideal counseling center.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.540]   May our Lord help his church gain this vision,
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.780]   equip its leaders and members to counsel others
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.740]   biblically and skillfully,
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.940]   and reach its members and their community
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.580]   with the life-changing hope found in Jesus Christ,
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.380]   the wonderful counselor.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.180]   Now, as I said, you would do well
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.900]   to take those dozen benefits
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.580]   and reflect possibly on three or four of those items
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.580]   and write out your own thoughts on the subject.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:29.900]   But I did an overview of that
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.500]   because I do hope you'll see
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:36.260]   that a church-based counseling ministry
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.460]   does have resources to offer to our counselees
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.860]   that a standalone or parachurch counseling ministry
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.700]   may not be able to offer.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.260]   Now, what I've done on pages four to six of your handout
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:54.460]   is I've highlighted three of,
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.100]   having done a survey of blessings or benefits
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   of church-based counseling,
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.500]   I've highlighted three items
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   that I found to be very significant in my own ministry
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.580]   and in leading the Kindred Center.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.060]   These are three benefits or distinctions
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.380]   of church-based ministry.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.260]   I'm gonna do this really briefly
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.980]   and then close our time together.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   But just three of those elements that are very helpful
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.420]   and have been very helpful to me.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.500]   Letter A would be that biblical counseling
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   operates under the oversight of elders in the local church.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:36.820]   So we always wanna be operating in partnership
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.980]   with the elders of the local church.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.980]   Ideally, if a counselee is coming from another local church,
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.900]   we wanna be operating in partnership
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.180]   with the elders of that local church
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:51.980]   and we don't wanna be going against the elders of a church.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:55.460]   One of the practical implications of this
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.420]   is we do not promise absolute confidentiality
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.940]   to our counselees.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.900]   We state that in the consent to counsel documents,
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.180]   which I've given you a copy of.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:09.300]   And we do retain the right to take an issue
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:13.420]   in the counseling relationship to the elders of the church
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.620]   if that is necessary.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.340]   Now, please be balanced with that
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:20.860]   because we do practice limited confidentiality,
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.260]   which is to say that
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.940]   if I can keep this information confidential,
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.780]   I will by all means be discreet and trustworthy
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.880]   with this information.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.540]   I will not disclose this information
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.580]   outside of the counseling relationship
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:39.300]   unless I am biblically mandated to do so
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:43.700]   or unless I'm under compulsion to do so
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:47.020]   because of legitimate reasons.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.580]   We do wanna be discreet
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.260]   and we do want to be confidential,
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:57.260]   but we never practice or promise absolute confidentiality
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:02.160]   and we have that in our counseling documents.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.440]   On page five, letter B,
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.040]   we do instruct our counselees to be involved
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.100]   in the ongoing ministry of the local church.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.860]   That includes Sunday morning gatherings,
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.040]   small group ministry.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.880]   We encourage them to get involved in the body of Christ
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.960]   and get involved in service.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.800]   And it is the combination of all of those ministries
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   alongside of counseling that has the resource
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.760]   and the power to change people's lives.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.180]   And then on the last page, on page six,
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:38.460]   I have a page there on church discipline.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:43.680]   We do believe that church discipline can be initiated
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.840]   if the counselee continues in unrepentant sin.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.800]   In next year, if you are involved
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.340]   in going through the counseling exams with me,
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.060]   you will write one entire essay
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.120]   on the subject of church discipline
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.000]   and your view of church discipline.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.140]   Just to note this briefly here on Matthew,
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.100]   on page six, you have Matthew 18, verse 15,
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.260]   which outlines the steps of church discipline.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.500]   You have private confrontation,
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.540]   semi-private confrontation, church-wide pursuit,
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:22.580]   and you have a removal from fellowship.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:27.020]   If counseling ministry is a ministry of the local church,
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.500]   then the members of our church who are being counseled
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.940]   can undergo church discipline
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:38.180]   if there is not repentance from ongoing sin.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.780]   Again, be balanced and careful with this.
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.100]   We have not had to do this
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.260]   in our counseling ministry as of yet,
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:49.100]   but that structure is in place as an accountability,
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.460]   as accountability to the local church.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:59.140]   And so all of that to say that I hope you have,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.060]   we've been given a good overview
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.900]   of how church-based counseling works
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.260]   and the benefits and the blessings of that.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.420]   And I would agree with Robert Jones' statement at the end
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.420]   that the local church remains God's ideal counseling center.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.500]   So ideally, the local church
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.700]   does not have a counseling center.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.660]   Ideally, the local church is the center
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.940]   where counseling ministry takes place,
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.300]   both formal and informal.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:35.540]   Ideally, the church is a community of counselors
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.980]   who speak the truth and love to one another
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.020]   and who do so both in informal settings,
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.260]   such as Starbucks or Coffee Bean
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:49.380]   or Corner Bakery or Flappy Jacks,
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.580]   and also do so in formal structure settings
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:57.580]   in a church office in a specific counseling room.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.580]   And all of that is so that the body of Christ
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.660]   can be built up to become more like Christ
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.780]   and to honor the one who has loved and saved us.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.420]   Just to let you know that this has been my prayer
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.620]   over the past number of years,
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:17.220]   that the church would catch a vision for biblical counseling,
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.420]   that the church would catch a vision
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.420]   for a counseling ministry
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.260]   that is both relational and biblical,
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.460]   that is both theological and practical,
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.980]   that is both rooted in the doctrine
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.740]   of the sufficiency of scripture
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.660]   and expresses a high view of the local church,
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.260]   and that the members of the church
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.540]   would catch a vision for how they could be used
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.220]   as instruments in the Redeemer's hands
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.340]   to give hope and help to those who are in need.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.780]   And I believe that even in the short time
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.140]   that I've been involved with ACBC,
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.980]   that God has been gracious to answer that prayer
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.100]   that already He has done exceedingly abundantly
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.460]   beyond what I could ask or think.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.900]   And I do believe that you who are enrolled in this class,
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.860]   working through these exam questions
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.260]   and working through these topics related to God's word,
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.340]   that you are an answer to the prayers
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.380]   that have been made in the past,
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.700]   that there would be members of the church
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.940]   who would catch a vision for this ministry
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.780]   and then be used as a catalyst
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.940]   to help others catch a vision
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.500]   for biblical counseling ministry.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.500]   I can think of probably no greater testament
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.860]   to the biblical counseling ministry
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.660]   and the character of the counselors
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.820]   that are part of this ministry
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.300]   than to say that many of our counselors
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.340]   have sat in on classes like this,
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.180]   have gone through year one training
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.540]   and then year two training,
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.120]   and then the third phase of certification process.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.060]   And then they have been unleashed in counseling rooms
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:00.260]   to counsel people, to counsel people
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:05.180]   who are dealing with addiction and sleeplessness
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:10.180]   and broken marriages and out of control anger problems
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.980]   and family issues and all of the issues
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:15.700]   that we see biblical counseling addresses
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.820]   that we've seen our counselors work through this training
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:22.920]   and then be used by God to bring hope and help
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.480]   to hurting people.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.140]   And there probably is no greater testament
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.880]   to these counselors ministry
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.760]   than to see that the people that they have counseled
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.760]   have then enrolled in these classes
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.760]   and have said that because I have been so helped
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.320]   by the word of God in biblical counseling,
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   I want to be trained to help others using God's word.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.120]   That's exceedingly abundantly beyond
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.120]   what I could have asked or thought five years ago
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.480]   when we began this ministry.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.400]   And I believe God is gonna use many of you
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.640]   in the very same way that as you complete these essays
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.240]   and as you move on to phase three of certification
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.720]   and as you moved on to meeting with people
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.520]   and loving them and helping them and caring for them
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.940]   and bringing the word of God to bear upon their problems,
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.840]   that God is gonna multiply your ministry in a wonderful way
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.600]   and that God is gonna use you in great ways.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.840]   So let me conclude our teaching this year
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.640]   and our class tonight with the benediction
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.440]   from Romans 15 verse 13, which says this,
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.720]   "May the God of hope fill you with all joy
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.480]   and peace and believing so that by the power
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.520]   of the Holy Spirit, you may abound in hope.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.300]   I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers,
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.940]   that you yourselves are full of goodness,
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:02.940]   filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another."
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.400]   Let's pray together.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   Father, thank you for this hour of study.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.560]   Thank you for this year of study.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.760]   Thank you for these 24 topics
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   that we have sought to carefully walk through as a class
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.140]   and that we have sought to articulate
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:26.440]   and put into our own words to put pen to paper.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.840]   We have devoted ourselves to this class and to this time
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.920]   because we believe your word is precious and powerful,
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.740]   because we love your church
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:39.180]   and because we understand what is at stake,
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:44.040]   that there are people whose lives are in need
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.880]   of good, solid biblical counseling,
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.200]   that they need more than what the secular world can offer,
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.120]   that they need the hope that is found
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.680]   in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.280]   And I just thank you, Father,
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   for the diligence of the students in this class.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.260]   I pray that you would help them
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.620]   as they complete these essays and as they move on
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.320]   to write the counseling exam essays.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.240]   And we pray that in years to come,
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.460]   that you would bear fruit in their lives
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.520]   and through their ministries
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.600]   that would be indeed exceedingly abundantly
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.240]   beyond all that we could ask or think,
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.200]   that you would multiply the fruitfulness of their lives
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.700]   and their ministry 30, 60, 100 fold,
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:32.460]   and that there would be many who come
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.560]   and say in years to come that they have received help
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.880]   and hope from God's word because of the result
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.440]   of the hours that we have spent together.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.960]   And so we just commit the fruit of this class to you.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.080]   We give you all the resources, all the time,
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.640]   all the hard work.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.120]   We give to you all of these essays,
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.760]   and we pray that, Lord, you would somehow use it all
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.440]   for your glory and for your praise
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.820]   and for the furtherance of the gospel
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.140]   and the building up of your church.
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.620]   And we thank you and pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.180]   - Amen.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.300]   Well, God bless you all.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.420]   Have a wonderful holidays.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.620]   I will send out notification of our next class in January.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.300]   Merry Christmas and.
