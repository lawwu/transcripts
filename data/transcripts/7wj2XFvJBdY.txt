[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   All right, so I'm looking at our show notes here.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.820]   We got two good blocks of questions.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.220]   Looks like later on, I'm also going to introduce a case study, try and do more of those, actually
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.300]   hear about someone who has applied some of this advice that we talked about and what
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.160]   it looked like.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.540]   As always, I encourage you to submit your own questions.
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.560]   There's links right in the show notes.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.800]   You go to a survey, boom, type it in, comes right to us.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.960]   We appreciate any and all questions that you send in.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.380]   All right, so before we get going with those questions, I want to start today as I often
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.080]   do with a deep dive.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.920]   Many of you have been sending me notes and messages and articles about the current workplace
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.760]   related internet trend, de jure, which is quiet quitting.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.920]   I then went relatively deep on this topic over the weekend for a writing project, something
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.600]   I was writing for a book chapter for my slow productivity book.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.960]   I went deep on this topic and did some research about where it started from and how it's being
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.840]   covered and what it's really all about.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.300]   So I figured this was a good excuse today's episode to actually talk about quiet quitting.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.600]   So if you haven't heard of this, this is the timeline I was able to excavate through my
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.880]   research.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.640]   This trend starts on TikTok.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880]   It starts in July.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.000]   So there is a TikTok username at the time, ZKChillin.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.920]   He has since changed his username, but his name was ZKChillin.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.400]   He posted a 17 second video on TikTok that featured soft piano music playing over a montage
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400]   of videos.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   There's one of it's him on the subway, and then you see a downtown New York City street
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.720]   and then a residential street.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.600]   And then for some reason, a child's automated bubble machine.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.680]   So it has this montage and you hear his voice and I wrote down what he says in that video.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.000]   So he says, I recently heard about this idea of quiet quitting where you're not quitting
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.160]   your job, but quitting the idea of going above and beyond in your work.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Then he goes on a little bit.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.200]   I won't read the whole thing to reject hustle culture, to reject the idea that hustle culture
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.160]   demands, which is that your work is your life.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.520]   And he says, the reality is that it's not, and your worth as a person is not defined
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.480]   by your labor.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.640]   So that TikTok video becomes popular.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.720]   Other TikTok users start posting videos about quiet quitting, in particular, lots of profession
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.920]   specific videos.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.400]   So there's a well-known one now that's a teacher talking about the demands of teaching and
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   et cetera.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   Right.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.800]   So it becomes a TikTok phenomenon.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.240]   The mainstream media picks it up as far as I can tell, early August, they pick this up
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.640]   and it has now been covered extensively in the mainstream media and other types of media
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   since then.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.800]   So it jumped from TikTok into mainstream discussion.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.360]   So I'm loading up here on the screen.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   So for those of you who are watching this episode or segment on YouTube, you can actually
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.640]   see the article, but I'll narrate for those who are just listening.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.160]   There is this article from the Guardian on August 6th, which I believe as far as I can
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   tell is one of the first actual old school media sources to tackle the topic.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.760]   So it was titled "Quiet quitting while doing the bare minimum at work has gone global"
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.480]   and it was written by James Tapper.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   I just want to point out a couple of things from this article and then what I want to
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.960]   do is give you my thoughts on all this.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.360]   So this article opens, I just want to point this out by saying Bartleby is back, although
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.180]   no doubt he would prefer not to be.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.240]   This is a very British way to open an article like that.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.320]   There is a book, Melville wrote a short story, I think it's a novella short story, I think
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.960]   it's a short story, maybe novella, called Bartleby the Scrivener.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.440]   And it's actually one of the first, as far as I can tell, books about knowledge work
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.600]   on Wii.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.200]   So check out that book if you haven't seen it.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.180]   But anyways, that's very British.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.520]   The number of American TikTok users who would know that reference I'm going to assume is
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.520]   low.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.160]   All right, so let me jump ahead here.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   Here's another key quote.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.640]   "Instead, they are doing just enough in the office to keep up," so this is talking about
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.880]   the "quiet quitters," "then leaving work on time and muting Slack."
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.680]   The writer then adds kind of snarkily, "then posting about it on social media."
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.140]   So here's the summary of quiet quitting that this Guardian article gave.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.520]   They're doing just enough in the office to keep up, then leaving work on time and muting
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   Slack.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.540]   Now, there's some good analysis in this piece trying to understand this trend.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.080]   So here's a quote from an expert.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.640]   "Since the pandemic, people's relationship with work has been studied in many ways, and
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   the literature typically across professions would argue that, yes, people's way of relating
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   to their work has changed."
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.460]   We talk about that often on the show, the impact of the pandemic on people stepping
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.040]   back and saying, "Wait a second.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   What's going on with my life?
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   What's going on with my work?
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.840]   Is it a good time to regroup?"
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.080]   Another quote from this expert, "The search for meaning has become far more apparent.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.340]   There's a sense of our own mortality during the pandemic, something quite existential
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.240]   around people thinking, 'What should work mean for me?
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.900]   What can I do in a role?
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.920]   How can I do a role that's more aligned to my values?'"
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.420]   And finally, we have another quote here from a Harvard Business School professor who introduced
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.540]   this term, "The great rethink" as a better way of describing the current moment in knowledge
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.420]   worked in something like the great resignation.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.100]   There's a lot of rethinking happening.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.500]   All right.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.540]   So I want to give, let me give some thoughts here.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.180]   First of all, I should go on to say this article, which was one of the first, was one of the
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.600]   better articles on this topic.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.000]   They defined what quite quitting was and then gave this psychological context, what's going
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.580]   on in the workplace, why might this trend have emerged?
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.560]   Since then, things have been going downhill.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:10.260]   I do not necessarily suggest getting, looking at the online coverage of this topic as I
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.760]   went into it for my, the chapter I was writing.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.260]   In the months since this, this idea first arose, I think online discussion and coverage
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.420]   has become a pile on of superficial criticality.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.460]   The online commentators are seeing this issue mainly as a chance to prove their sophistication
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.180]   and bona fides by trying to one-up whoever talked about it last by pointing out what
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.180]   they missed.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.180]   You thought this is wrong, but you're the problem because you missed out on this problem
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.180]   and then someone else comes in.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.940]   And I find it to be completely non-useful.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.300]   So you have the original quiet quitters on TikTok, and then you get the reaction that's
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.740]   like kids are lazy.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.020]   This is just called having a job.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.620]   What are you talking about?
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.780]   And then you have the crew that comes in and says, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, you both are wrong
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.220]   because what neither of you are doing is cataloging every single identity group and trying to
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.000]   argue which identity groups will have an easier time than worse.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.880]   You have to have a huge appendix trying to rank order the ease with which different groups
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.200]   can do quiet quitting.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.780]   And until you acknowledge that you're the problem, then someone else comes in and says,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.540]   "No, all of you guys are the problem because what you don't realize is that you're bougie
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.820]   stooges and the key here is to rebuild capitalism and replace it with something better."
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.660]   This discussion in general is just part of the superstructure that is upholding this
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.380]   economic exploitation.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.140]   Everyone trying to one-up everyone else, everyone else trying to make everyone else seem dumber
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.780]   than them.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.780]   It's a mess.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.780]   It's a pile on.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.060]   Ignore it.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.060]   So let's push that aside.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.780]   Let's get rid of the posture and get back to the original issue here of quiet quitting
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.140]   and this context that I think the Guardian provided, which I think is quite good.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.500]   So I think there is something important here.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.820]   What we're seeing in that TikTok discussion is a new generation.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.960]   We'll call it this pandemic generation, the generation that had the pandemic disruptions
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.420]   hit early in their adulthood.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.880]   Meaning for lack of a better word, lifestyle design.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.460]   The idea that work is one of the factors that you can intentionally deploy as part of a
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.260]   larger plan to construct a life that is meaningful or deep.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.180]   So it's an intentional approach to life in which you are designing your life to meet
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.140]   whatever criteria you have for meaning and depth.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.360]   So it is good to see a new generation discovering this.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.780]   The frustration is, is they're starting from scratch.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.500]   I mean, quiet quitting is a simplistic and crude first step towards trying to understand,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.220]   well, wait a second.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.140]   What role does work have in my life?
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.140]   I'm working too much.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.140]   I don't know why.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.140]   Probably because someone's being evil.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.940]   I think I'm going to work less.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.620]   It's a very simplistic first step towards a deeper, more necessary conversation.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:58.440]   This is a topic that has been covered every single generation going back quite a few generations.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.220]   Go back to the 19th century, read Walden by Thoreau, jump forward to the 20th century,
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.860]   read the seven story mountain, jump forward another 20 years, read Zen and the Art of
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.700]   Motorcycle Maintenance, jump forward to the 21st century.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.880]   You can start with Eat, Pray, Love, then go onwards to the four hour work week, which
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.600]   by the way, was covering this exact issue the last time we went through this, which
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.080]   was the post 9/11 recession.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.160]   And my generation, the early millennials entering the working world and trying to find their
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.520]   way, we had Tim Ferriss's version of lifestyle design.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   It's also covered by us here on the show and in my writing extensively when we talk about
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.780]   the deep life and lifestyle centric career planning and career capital and the method
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.080]   of intentionally trying to construct a life that is deep and how you have to be systematic
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.680]   and deploy lots of different angles at it.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.020]   So it's not a topic we're starting from scratch.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.160]   The TikTok crew kind of is.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.960]   So I think this is the good news, bad news.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.200]   The good news is what a topic.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.760]   And I'm glad I think it's a serious topic and I'm glad it's getting attention with this
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   particular group.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.680]   The bad news is, look, if you start from scratch, I don't think you're going to catch up to
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.400]   Thoreau anytime soon.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.780]   Like people have thought about this.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.600]   So you should pull from what is already out there.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.640]   So I think this is an important topic.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.000]   I'm glad it's being looked at.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.200]   This pandemic generation probably has had the most impetus to look at this topic that
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.600]   we've seen since, I don't know, maybe the Zen of the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.240]   sort of 1960s, early 70s.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.040]   That's probably the last time we had a comparable disruption in culture, evolution of culture
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.680]   that required a pretty serious re-rethinking.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.000]   That eventually, by the way, led to the 1980s.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.160]   We talked about this recently, early 1990s notion of passion and following your passion
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.600]   and the bastardization of Campbell's Follow Your Bliss, which has been the mixed bag.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.720]   And we're having another one of these evolutions now.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.680]   The great rethink of induced by the pandemic is going on.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.360]   We're trying to rethink these things.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   So I think quiet quitting is reflecting a good trend.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.120]   Even if the details of these TikTok videos are easy to dismiss, I would say let's resist
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   that urge.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.200]   Yes, if you're going to look at 23-year-olds posting 17-second videos, we can make fun,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.240]   we can make ourselves feel smarter than everyone else.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.640]   But I think what we should do is see this as an opportunity to help a group, a large
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.480]   group of dissatisfied and earnestly searching people find their way so they don't have to
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   do this all from scratch.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.120]   So that's my thoughts on quiet quitting, Jesse.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.040]   It seems like that would be a topic in both books that you're going to work on.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.360]   Because this is a slow productivity book, right?
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   Slow productivity, right.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.760]   That seems like it would be even a bigger product topic in your next book.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.800]   Yeah, I think the Deep Life book is going to be a big topic, is going to be a good match
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   for this.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.680]   I mean, it's all in the air right now.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.840]   And this happens every generation.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.880]   You get to a place, economically things are going good, there's other concerns, you don't
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.200]   really think much about work.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.720]   And then once you get going, something happens and you're like, well, what role is work supposed
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.800]   to have in my life, what's going on here?
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.240]   And people try to figure this out.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.120]   So with slow productivity, how does it relate?
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.200]   Well, I mean, I think slow productivity is maybe a little bit more narrow in its attack
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   on this topic, but slow productivity is saying, what even are you going for when you say you
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   want to be productive?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.400]   Like, what is your definition of a working life well executed?
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.680]   And the argument there is that we have these, we don't think it through.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.960]   We have these superficial definitions.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.560]   I don't know, busyness is better than less, hustling is better than not hustling.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.240]   I want to feel like I'm earning my keep, but it's all very haphazard.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.080]   And a lot of what we actually do when we're trying to get after it, quote unquote, in
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.440]   our work is ironically counterproductive, makes us more miserable.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.240]   It's not maximizing useful output.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.520]   And so slow productivity is saying, why don't we go back and rethink what we even mean by
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.080]   productivity, especially when it comes to knowledge work, to try to find something that's
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.640]   more sustainable, that's going to make life more meaningful, and it ultimately is going
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   to produce better stuff.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.560]   So it's like a narrow first stab at the great rethink.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.420]   And then the deep life is much broader.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.400]   The deep life is where you say, you know what, we're going to move to Kentucky.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.480]   So quiet quitting kind of helps define it.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   And then from there you can start.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.120]   Quiet quitting or quiet quitting is a response to the same underlying impetus that my books
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.560]   are coming out of, which is people starting to rethink work, its role in their life, and
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   what they're trying to do with their life more generally.
