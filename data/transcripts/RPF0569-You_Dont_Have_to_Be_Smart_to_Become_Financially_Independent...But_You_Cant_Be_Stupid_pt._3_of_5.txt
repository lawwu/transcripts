[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.400]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   I'm your host.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.920]   And today we continue with part three of our five-part series called, "You Don't Have to
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.200]   Be Smart to Become Financially Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid."
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.880]   And today I want to talk to you about your investments.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.000]   Part three of my framework for wealth is invest wisely.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.160]   By way of reminder, part one is increase income, two is decrease expenses, and three is invest
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.880]   wisely.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.260]   You must invest wisely in order for you to become financially independent.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.360]   But here's the great news.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.780]   Wise investing is not that hard to do.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.880]   The information is easily available on how to be a decent investor.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.360]   The information is relatively straightforward.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.640]   All it requires is for you to be thoughtful and careful in your decision-making.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.920]   Now the first thing that you'll need to consider when it comes to investing wisely is you need
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.080]   to consider what type of investments would be best for you.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.520]   There are some people who are very well-suited to investing in stocks.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.200]   There are some people who are not well-suited to investing in stocks.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.960]   Do a careful analysis and try to figure out what would be best for you.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.940]   If you enjoy your job, you find your job to be meaningful and you're earning a sufficient
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.400]   level of income there, you like to spend your weekends down at the lake, and you don't have
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.280]   any other major business interests, you're not that interested in buying houses, then
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.280]   go and just invest money into mutual funds in your 401(k).
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.720]   The fundamentals of stock investing are very simple.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480]   Buy some mutual funds.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.520]   Choose low-cost mutual funds.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.560]   Buy them and don't ever sell them.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.720]   Basically it's as simple as this.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   If you pick an index fund in your 401(k), hopefully there's a good one with a broad
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.280]   base, something like a total stock market index fund is really sufficient.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   Keep your expenses low and then don't open the statement so you're not tempted to sell
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.920]   it and just put money into it year after year, decade after decade, barring some world-changing
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.680]   calamity.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.040]   You're probably going to be really rich in a couple of decades.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.440]   You don't need anything more than that.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.600]   It's that simple.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Now if you're not well-suited to stocks, you have personal reasons that you don't particularly
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.000]   care to invest in the stock market, I, as one financial advisor, I don't think you're
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.280]   stupid for that.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.080]   But I do think that you should consider your approach and not just abstain from investing
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   in stocks and have that automatically mean that you abstain from investing.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.440]   I think you should just choose another area of investment.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.280]   Let's talk the other simplest area of investment, real estate.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.440]   You don't have to be a genius to put together a reasonable real estate portfolio.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.960]   Here's a simple suggestion.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.440]   Buy a starter home when you're young and then when you need a bigger home, if you've decided,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   just keep the starter home, rent it out.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.600]   When your mother-in-law's cousin dies and you become aware that the house is available,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.000]   go ahead and buy it.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.240]   It's probably going to be fine.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   If you'll just put together a portfolio of three, four, five houses, you can manage them
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.880]   yourself and go ahead and finance them and then pay them off over time.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.400]   You can become financially independent and have a very stable investment portfolio, especially
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.440]   if you are the common man.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.440]   The common man frequently has the skills or the network to fix the things that go wrong
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.240]   on a house and not get taken to the bank.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.520]   I try to get so many of my friends who just don't seem to think about it to say, "Listen,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.440]   just buy some houses."
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.040]   The average family, if they own five single family houses, would be financially independent
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.160]   beyond their wildest dreams.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.440]   Well, guess what?
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.680]   Buy a house, pay it off in 10 years.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   Buy another one, pay it off in 10 years.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.920]   Buy another one, pay it off in 10 years.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.080]   Whatever works for you.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.800]   You can pay them off faster.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.280]   But if you'll just buy some houses and let your tenants pay off the mortgages for you,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.840]   you'll wind up financially independent.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.800]   We move on to the third category, some other type of investment, some business investment
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.760]   or some other class of assets that's not so common.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.440]   If you want to buy steers and fatten them up and sell them at the market, go for it.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.980]   That's a great investment if you know what you're doing.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.640]   If you want to buy cheap cars and fix them up and get a dealer's license and sell them,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.640]   go for it.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.100]   That's a great investment.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.520]   If you want to buy old guns and fix them up and refinish them and sell them, go for it.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.680]   That's a great investment.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.480]   Don't let someone out there tell you that you can't look at an asset and say, "This
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.960]   is underutilized," and fix something up and sell it.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.880]   Use your money and go for it.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.680]   Or with regard to your business, if you're running a business and you see that you have
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.120]   a lot of profit potential in that business, go for it.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.780]   Invest in it.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.680]   Just don't be stupid.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   Don't always put all your money in the business.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.540]   Don't always put everything on the line for it.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.760]   Don't go deeply into debt.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.080]   Just think about investing wisely.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.440]   I get really annoyed when people just think there's only one way to invest.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.360]   There are many ways to invest, but you've got to invest.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.400]   If you're going to become financially independent, you've got to invest.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.840]   Here's what I've learned.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.400]   A lot of people make stupid mistakes when it comes to investing.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.880]   I've made my share of stupid mistakes and I'll probably make them again.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.760]   You know how most stupid mistakes are fixed?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.100]   Just give it a little bit of time.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.800]   If you'll give some time to a stupid mistake, often the markets change.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.880]   Often you'll be able to right the wrong, fix the problem.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   Just give it time.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.040]   I don't know how to give you more specific advice than that.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.640]   You choose what's an appropriate avenue of investing for you.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.540]   Many, many plans will work if you will work them consistently.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.840]   That's the closing theme I want to mention to you.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.000]   When I was younger, I was super interested in investing in stocks.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.400]   I reviewed all kinds of plans.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.080]   I reviewed all kinds of strategies.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.600]   I was always trying to figure out what's the best strategy.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   There might be the best strategy out there that somebody else more competent than me
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.080]   can know.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.200]   Here's what I concluded.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.800]   Almost any strategy that is proven, that is not crazy, will work if you'll just do it
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.720]   consistently.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.280]   But very rarely do you find a person who has the character and the tenacity just follow
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.920]   the strategy consistently.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.560]   Same thing with real estate.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.360]   Same thing with business.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.120]   You can get rich buying McDonald's and growing them.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.640]   But it's rare to find somebody who's able to apply themselves to such a simple thing
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.320]   consistently.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.760]   You can get rich buying a local Subway franchise or whatever franchise that you're interested
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   in.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.960]   You don't need a great business idea.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.980]   You just need to come in and say, "This is my avenue for investment.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.400]   This is the business I've chosen.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.920]   I'm going to follow the manual."
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:05.840]   So pick a strategy and do it consistently, reliably, diligently over time.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:13.760]   And if you'll do that and stick with your investments and don't be stupid, you'll become
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.880]   wealthy.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   Thank you for listening.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.100]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.940]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.660]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.040]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.800]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.840]   action on it.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.240]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.560]   to a life change.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.200]   So take action.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.880]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.440]   that you care about.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.640]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.100]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.960]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.800]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.080]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.800]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.440]   this work voluntarily.

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   right to you.
