[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.880]   the book of the prophet Ezekiel chapter 17 and verse 24, the 24th, the last verse in
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.000]   the 17th chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.320]   "And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought down the high
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:38.080]   tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080]   to flourish.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.920]   I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it."
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.280]   Now perhaps it would be well for me to read from verse 22 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.440]   "Thus saith the Lord God, I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   will set it.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.680]   I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.600]   a high mountain and eminent.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it, and it shall bring forth boughs
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.800]   and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar; and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.320]   In the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.080]   And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, have brought down the high
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.080]   tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.080]   to flourish.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.240]   I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it."
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   Now this is just one of those remarkable passages of prophecy, which are to be found in such
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.320]   abundance in the writings of these Old Testament prophets.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.640]   It is one of those prophecies of the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.280]   of the setting up of his kingdom.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.960]   Here is a man living centuries before the event, who having been given the revelation
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   and the understanding by God, thus delivers his message.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.640]   And as is characteristic of the prophetic message, he not only puts it in a pictorial
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.280]   form, but he at the same time puts it in a way which causes it to deal with immediate
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.720]   history.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.120]   He was writing to his contemporaries, the prophets were always practical men, we must
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.360]   not think of them as visionaries, away from life and remote and apart, they were men who
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.580]   were primarily concerned to deliver a practical message to their fellow countrymen.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.400]   And as they deal with immediate events, they then, under this guidance and leading of the
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.080]   Holy Spirit, are led on to see something further of God's great and gracious purpose, and
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.800]   so they prophesy the coming of the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:26.400]   That is what is meant by this twig which is taken off from the branch of this goodly cedar,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.200]   and how it is planted on the top of the mountain in the height of Israel, and how from a humble
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.240]   and almost insignificant beginning it becomes a great kingdom, which eventually is going
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.600]   to capture and to conquer all the kingdoms of this world, and Jesus Christ shall reign
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.440]   where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run, his kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.520]   till moons shall wax and wane no more.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.880]   It's a prophecy then, I say, of the coming of the kingdom of the Son of God our Lord
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.200]   and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.840]   But I'm calling attention to it this evening, not so much to emphasize that aspect of prophecy,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.400]   but I'm calling attention to it because in this interesting way the prophet also reminds
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:29.420]   us of what are, after all, the essential characteristics of this kingdom, or if you prefer it, the essential
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.160]   characteristics of the Christian way of salvation.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.200]   Now I'm choosing this form in which to put it to you because, you notice, it's put in
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.080]   the form of a picture.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.440]   The whole chapter is a great picture about a number of trees, and here this picture,
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.600]   this image is continued right until the very end, and it's put in this form that God is
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.640]   going to bring down the high tree and he's going to exalt the low tree.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:10.680]   He's going to dry up the green tree and he is going to make the dry tree to flourish.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.360]   Now this, it seems to me, is a very vital matter for our consideration.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.560]   More and more I am convinced that the trouble which so many people seem to have with the
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.540]   Christian faith and the Christian message, the thing, in other words, that seems to them
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.760]   to be an obstacle to their becoming Christian, all, it seems to me, arises from the fact
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.440]   that it is their essential idea of the thing that is at fault.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.760]   Now you generally find that people put forward their difficulties, we all do the same of
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.160]   course, they tend to put forward their difficulties in detail.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.960]   Why this, for I don't understand that.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   But surely before you ever come to the realm of detail, it is always well to look at a
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.480]   thing like this as a whole.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.740]   There are certain branches of learning in which you have to learn the language, as it
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.720]   were, before you can possibly hope to do anything else.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.440]   And if you're ignorant of the language, well there's no point in proceeding any
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   further.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   There are realms in which you must have the essential spirit before you can proceed.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.240]   If a man has no kind of musical faculty or interest or taste, well he can sit and listen
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.840]   to lectures on music, but he probably won't profit.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.720]   There is a given datum, surely, with regard to every branch of knowledge.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.480]   Now that's very vital and very important in connection with this whole question of
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.240]   the Christian faith.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.200]   And I am suggesting that so many people are in trouble because they've not realized
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:05.640]   at the very beginning the character of this message, and the uniqueness of its character,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.760]   and the way in which it differs in a most essential manner from everything else that
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.160]   is confronting mankind this evening.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.120]   If they're wrong thus at the beginning, they must of necessity be wrong in all their
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.320]   subsequent searching and endeavor.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.760]   If you're wrong on your fundamental principle, you will of necessity be wrong in all your
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   details.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:37.280]   Now, the children of Israel were constantly falling into this self-same error.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.800]   The Old Testament is a longish book, and yet you know there's a sense in which it's
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.920]   a very simple book, because it's really got only one message, and it goes on repeating
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   it.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   It puts it in different ways.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.680]   It puts it historically, it puts it didactically, it puts it in form of direct teaching, but
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.600]   it's always the same point.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.120]   It's roughly this.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.040]   God had made this one nation for himself, this nation of Israel.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.840]   They were his own peculiar people, standing out, apart, and distinct from all the other
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.680]   nations.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.200]   And God had a certain plan and a certain program for them.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.360]   He'd made certain promises to them, but he always laid down his conditions.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.760]   Now, the trouble with the children of Israel was that they never seemed to have grasped
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   their uniqueness.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   You read the story, doesn't matter at what age, they were always falling into this error.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   They could not see that the thing that mattered about them was their relationship to God,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.560]   and that because they were God's people, that everything that applied to them must
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.440]   be different from all the other nations.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.680]   Now, they wouldn't see that.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.420]   They said, "We are a nation like every other nation.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.160]   We ought to be doing what other nations are doing."
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.680]   You remember that they asked for a king.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.640]   God never intended them to have a king.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.600]   God was to rule them himself directly.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.120]   Israel was meant to be a theocracy, but they wouldn't have that.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.680]   They said, "The other nations have got kings.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.240]   Why shouldn't we have a king?"
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.080]   And they agitated for a king.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:20.800]   Now, it was all, I say, due to the fact that they'd never seen that God's way of dealing
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   with them must never be thought of in line of what was happening to other nations, that
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.400]   this was a unique work and a separate work.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.840]   They couldn't see it.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   They always went the other way, and the result was that eventually they landed themselves
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   in disaster.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.960]   Now, there, I say, is a great and a grand object lesson for us.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.520]   It is something that is being done still by large numbers of men and women.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.280]   They start in the wrong way.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.560]   They haven't seen the foundation.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.480]   They've never understood this vital point of difference with respect to the gospel.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.400]   Well, now then, let me show you how all that is worked out and illustrated here by this
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   prophet Ezekiel in this picture of his "About the Trees."
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:22.280]   Here, I say, are underlined and emphasized the essential characteristics of this Christian
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.640]   message, this Christian way of salvation.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:32.680]   Now, we're in a world full of trouble and full of problems, full of pain and of difficulties.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.400]   We know our personal problems.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.680]   We know something about the larger problems in groups of society, and there's between
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.000]   nations and the whole problem of the world.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.960]   And we are being addressed by various voices.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.000]   Various ideas are being put before us, and amongst them here is this message of the Christian
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   faith.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.840]   Now, I say, nothing is so vital and all-important as that we should understand, before we come
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:07.400]   down to any details at all, what are the essential characteristics of this Christian message.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.880]   Well, now then, here's the first.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:24.640]   It is God's action, and God's action entirely, "Thus saith the Lord God, I the Lord have
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.920]   spoken and have done it.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.560]   And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.400]   tree, have exalted the low tree."
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   It's always God, you see.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:51.200]   Now, this sounds so elementary, doesn't it, as almost to be unnecessary.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.120]   And yet I suppose that it's here at the very beginning and at the very origin of the
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.960]   whole matter that most people will go astray.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.080]   We all seem to have the idea by nature that religion, Christianity, is something like
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:15.120]   this, that God is there somewhere distantly in the heavens, static as it were, immovable.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.520]   And that the whole business of Christianity, the whole message of the Bible, is something
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:26.160]   which is an exhortation to us to do something and to arrive at God.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.920]   It's assumed, you see, that man is anxious to know God and to find God and to please
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.480]   God, and that all man needs, therefore, is help and a stimulus and something that will
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.560]   act as a kind of Philip to him in this endeavor of his to arrive at this knowledge of God.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:51.600]   Now, I think you'll agree that that is the kind of basic assumption which we all tend
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   to make.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.080]   I'm never tired of putting it in this form.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.440]   Ask people in a discussion on religion, listen to them having their discussions about it,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.520]   read the books about it, you'll see it constantly suggested in the papers.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.720]   And it's always this idea that it's all something that you and I have got to do primarily
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:18.760]   and essentially, and yet, you know, that is a complete denial of the message of the Bible
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.200]   from the very beginning to the very end.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.680]   The Old Testament, for instance, is not what it's so often said to be at the present
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.680]   time.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.400]   It is not a history of the search of mankind for God.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.840]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:47.080]   It is the history and the story of God the Eternal seeking lost men.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.560]   The Bible is the record of the activity of God.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.820]   Of course, he has taught men to do things, he has stimulated men, he has inspired men
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.960]   to do things, but the actor in the Bible is God and not man.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.240]   That's why it's so different from every other type of history.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:12.060]   This isn't secular history, this isn't merely human history, this is divine history.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.000]   The whole purpose of this book is to tell us of what God has done in this world, how
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.880]   he has intervened, how he has entered into it, what he has done about it.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.840]   All along, I say, it is this mighty activity of God.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:33.120]   The whole story of the children of Israel surely proves that in and of itself.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.580]   It was God who called Abraham from Ur of the Chaldeans.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.920]   It was God who prepared him, the man was living amongst pagans in a state of paganism and
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.200]   he would have continued to do so unless God had visited him.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.940]   It's God all along, and so on right through the subsequent story.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.560]   And yet the astounding thing is that people with an open Bible and having read it, still
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.820]   think of it primarily as an activity of their own.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:06.960]   And as long as, of course, as we think in that way and in those terms, we must of necessity
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.000]   go astray.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.780]   The unique thing about the Christian faith is this, that it comes primarily to us as
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:26.080]   a message, an announcement, a proclamation of what God has done, it's good news, hence
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   the term 'gospel'.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   That's what it means.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   We are asked to listen to something, some thrilling good news, some statement and explanation
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:43.080]   of what God the Lord, as he tells us here, has done amongst us, men and for our salvation.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:51.420]   It is God's way of redeeming men, not man's way of arriving at God.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.520]   Now you notice that that becomes important for this reason.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.920]   You notice how the Apostle Paul puts it.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.080]   And I want to show you this evening the strange correspondence between this one verse and
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.360]   its essential message and the tremendous passage of scripture that we read at the beginning
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.120]   out of that first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.440]   There Paul puts, in a much more modern way for us, no longer in a picture but in bold
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.400]   and varnished statements, the precise message that we've got here.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:32.500]   You notice how he tends to wind up his message, he says, "Him the Gloria, let him glory
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.740]   in the Lord."
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:40.080]   In other words, if I may put it in the form of a test which we can apply to ourselves,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.600]   there's a very simple way in which any one of us can prove for certain whether we are
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.040]   Christian or not.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.000]   Wouldn't we like to know that for certain?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.680]   Well, I know no more thoroughgoing test than this.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:03.200]   I know of no better, a more subtle, delicate, acid test than this one.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:11.480]   Do you realize at this moment that you owe everything to the grace of God?
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:19.960]   "Him the Gloria, let him glory in the Lord."
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.160]   It's put negatively in exactly the same way that there may be no glorying in men, that
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.840]   every mouth may be stopped, that all human boasting may be silenced.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.640]   The test of a Christian is this.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.040]   The Christian is a man who knows that he is what he is, as Paul puts it, by the grace
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.920]   of God.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:45.400]   All the glory must go to God, and if it doesn't, well, we are not Christians.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.520]   You can be religious without being a Christian.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:56.400]   And of course, if you are just religious, you must take all the glory to yourself.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.760]   Saul of Tarsus did that, didn't he, before his conversion?
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.120]   He tells us how proud he was, how boastful he was.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   What did he boast about?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.040]   Well, he boasted about the fact that he was so religious.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.200]   He not only boasted about his birth and his upbringing, he said, as touching the Lord,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.080]   blameless, exceeding all others in zeal and in knowledge and in everything else.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.900]   He was glorying in himself.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.040]   He said, look at me.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.440]   I am fasting, I am sweating, I am praying, I am studying the scriptures, I am expounding
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   them.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.800]   This is what I am doing, and I am a good man, I am better than others, I am a godly man,
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:38.420]   look at me, boasting, calling attention to himself, glorying in himself.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.960]   But that was when he wasn't a Christian.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:50.320]   When he becomes a Christian, he says, him that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   That's it.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.260]   You see, the thing is absolutely different.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.520]   Well, it's simply another way of putting this proposition, that the first thing we
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:11.120]   have to grasp about the Christian faith is that it's something that God has done.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.720]   It is God's action which is offered to us, which we are asked to believe and to receive,
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.000]   in which we are asked to rejoice, and from which we are asked to benefit.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.980]   The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.980]   Lord.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:40.080]   Now, there it is at the very beginning, and yet I trust that no one will resent it if
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.360]   I again put my question.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:51.540]   Had your understanding of Christianity, my friend, started at that point?
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.720]   Had you always thought of it as something which the blessed, glorious God himself has
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.880]   done?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.480]   Have you instinctively thought of it as not the record of man's activity or achievement,
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.760]   but when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:15.240]   under the law, always God the Lord, from beginning to end, I the Lord have spoken and have done
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.240]   it?
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.520]   No, that's the starting point.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.560]   But let me come to this second matter, which is the one that is emphasised here perhaps
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.360]   still more.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:35.840]   That God's way of saving men is entirely unexpected and surprising.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.280]   It is a complete reversal of everything we would ever have thought of and everything
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.840]   that we would ever have imagined.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   Now this is to me, in many senses, more and more the most vital point of all.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:03.440]   Now it's my privilege often to talk to people about these things and intelligent, intellectual
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.360]   men, and invariably I'm confronted by the same situation, God knows I understand it,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.720]   I've been guilty of the same thing myself.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.920]   The whole approach seems to be this, they've read and they've studied and they've thought,
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.880]   they've considered this view and that view, well now then here's this Christian view,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.160]   and they approach it in exactly the same way.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.240]   They start by thinking that it's one in series with a number of religions and a number of
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.160]   philosophies and so on, and therefore it's to be approached in exactly the same way.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   Now I say the moment a man tells me that, I know that he hasn't started at all, he's
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:50.840]   on the wrong road, and as long as he remains in that position, he simply cannot be a Christian.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.600]   How can I make this plain and clear?
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:02.080]   Christianity is the reversal of everything natural and everything human.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.840]   Now that's not an overstatement, that is an exact and a scientific statement.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:12.200]   It is a reversal of that which is natural and human.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:19.640]   Now it's put here in this form, I the Lord have brought down the high tree and have exalted
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:26.240]   the low tree, have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.920]   Now you can't imagine any greater reversal of a position than that.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.680]   The high is brought down, the low is raised up, the green is made dry and the dry is made
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   green.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.080]   A complete reversal.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:47.160]   Now again, it is a vital part of my message this evening to establish the fact that that
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.880]   is something which is stated everywhere in the Bible.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.360]   It isn't merely stated here by Ezekiel, Isaiah says exactly the same thing.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:06.720]   "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him when he is near.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:16.360]   For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways, saith the Lord.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.720]   For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways and your ways, and my thoughts
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.160]   and your thoughts."
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.120]   Couldn't it be plainer than that?
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.760]   Don't begin to think, says Isaiah, in the same way, that this is just one in series,
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   that it's something human.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   It isn't.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.600]   This isn't a human philosophy, this is God.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.760]   This is God's way, this is God's thought, this is God's speech, this is God's action.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.160]   And there's nothing else in the world like it.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.560]   There's never been anything, there never will be.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.640]   This is absolutely alone and unique.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:01.560]   But I suppose there's no better statement of it anywhere in Scripture than that tremendous
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.000]   statement of it that we were reading there together at the beginning in that first chapter
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.840]   of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, and that is why we read it.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.300]   Here the apostle, you remember, is throwing out his great challenge.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.400]   What is this gospel?
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:28.620]   Well, Paul says it's something like this, "The foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.440]   and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.720]   For, you see, you're calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.320]   many mighty, not many noble are called."
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   Well, what's been happening?
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.520]   "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.080]   the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and various things
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.320]   of the world, and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:25:01.400]   not to bring to naught things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence."
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:11.720]   Now, there it is, you see, so plain and unequivocal, so clear, and yet as I'm trying to tell you
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:18.480]   this evening, the whole tragedy of the position is that men and women speak and think and
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.020]   argue and debate as if Paul had never written at all.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.200]   They will not realize at the very beginning that here they come into a realm which is
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.440]   altogether different, that all the categories to which they've been accustomed must be
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   left outside, and that they start in an entirely new world and with an entirely new outlook.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:50.280]   I'm emphasizing this, I'm trying to underline it.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:59.140]   The Christian message, the Christian salvation, is absolutely unlike anything that man has
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.160]   ever thought or imagined.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:07.260]   It has the uniqueness of a message that comes directly from God.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:16.840]   Now then, if that is the general proposition, let me hurriedly illustrate it to you.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.720]   I say that if your conception of Christianity hasn't come to you as a surprise, as something
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:29.860]   passing strange and wonderful, as something that has caused you to reverse all your ideas,
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.340]   and as it were to stand on your head or be turned upside down, to use the New Testament
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.740]   language at a point, if it hasn't come like that, I say you've never known it.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.940]   If you just as a natural man have taken up Christianity, if you've espoused some kind
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.580]   of Christian philosophy, well, I'm sorry, but as I understand this statement, you are
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.380]   just not a Christian.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.340]   It's the complete reversal.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.720]   It's the turning upside down, inside out.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.300]   It's entirely different from all we've ever known.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.260]   Let me give you the illustrations of this.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.700]   Look at it in the case of our blessed Lord and Saviour himself.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:17.820]   Now this is the kind of thing that the New Testament tells us.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.180]   Everything about the Lord Jesus Christ was surprising.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.180]   It was passing strange.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.180]   It was astonishing.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.980]   It was so strange, you see, that people wouldn't believe it.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.380]   The Jews wouldn't believe it.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.900]   The Gentiles, the able Gentiles, the philosophers, they likewise rejected it.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.900]   Why?
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.940]   Well, because it was so absolutely different from anything they'd ever expected.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.340]   Now the Jews, as a result of their prophetic teaching, were awaiting the coming of their
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.340]   Messiah.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.980]   They were looking forward to this.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:00.540]   They said when he came, he would do everything that they needed, and he would set them free.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.980]   Then in the fullness of the times, he came and appeared before them and preached to them.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.060]   And they resented him, and they rejected him.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.740]   They threw stones at him.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.460]   And when they were given the choice of this man or a robber called Barabbas, they said,
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.460]   "Give us Barabbas.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.940]   Away with this Jesus.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.340]   Crucify him."
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.180]   They rejected him.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.180]   Why?
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.140]   Well, you know the answer.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:28.500]   It was because he was so essentially and absolutely different from anything they'd ever thought
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.940]   of or imagined or expected.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.940]   It's still the same.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.380]   You see, in his very birth he was different.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.420]   You ask men to tell you how they imagined the Son of God would come into this world,
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:46.180]   and they think immediately in some terms of some great theophany, some great appearance,
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:52.140]   some specter, some sign in the heavens, and some great eternal royal personage appearing
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.900]   on earth.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   But when the Son of God came, when the mighty Deliverer arrived, it was in a stable.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:15.020]   Not even in the inn, crowded out in the stable with the cattle, and his little body laid
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.580]   in a manger.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.860]   He came in lowliness.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.600]   He came in abject poverty.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:32.940]   He came to use the scriptural imagery as a root out of a dry ground, no pomp and ceremony.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:40.420]   But the Son of God, the Creator of the world, came in utter weakness like a helpless babe,
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.780]   indistinguishable from any other babe to look at him and to handle.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   Here he is.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:51.500]   You see, at once we are in this new realm, this strange way of God.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.140]   Men would never have ordered it like that.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.020]   Men don't order things like that.
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.340]   They do things in king's palaces.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.180]   That's where the great are born, but not so the Son of God.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.060]   The exact opposite of anything you'd ever have thought of.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.060]   But there it is.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.580]   That's the principle, and here's the illustration.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.660]   And then look at his life for a moment.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.500]   You would have thought that when the Son of God came here on earth, there would have been
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.700]   everything wonderful about his way of living and about his upbringing, his teaching, his
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.340]   training, and the display of his knowledge and so on.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.900]   Oh, I needn't keep you.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.780]   You know the actual record is the exact opposite of all that.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:39.660]   He came and was brought up as a boy, and he began to work as a carpenter with his hands,
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.660]   but not his hands.
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.860]   That's how he spent his life.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:51.300]   Indeed, the most astonishing thing of all, it always seems to me, is this, that until
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:58.040]   the age of 30, he spent his time entirely in that way.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.260]   Not in the schools, not in the academies, not in the then seats of learning, not being
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.100]   trained even as a Pharisee.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:11.620]   No, but just doing this manual labor, this ordinary work, not only not in a king's palace,
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.700]   but I say, apparently no preparation at all.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.780]   And up until the age of 30, just that.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:25.900]   The Son of God who's come down to save men, that's how he spends his time.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:31.900]   Isn't it obvious that when God acts, he acts in a manner that's entirely incomprehensible
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.620]   to men?
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.940]   It seems to be unutterable folly.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:41.420]   That's what Paul puts it, you see, with his masterly irony, "The foolishness of God is
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.420]   wiser than men."
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.060]   And may I venture, therefore, to use his terms and his phrase, can you imagine greater folly
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.060]   than that?
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:58.540]   Ascending the Savior in the form of a babe and a carpenter, monstrous folly, "The foolishness
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:04.540]   of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.660]   And then go on and look at his ministry.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:15.220]   Here again he ever surprised his contemporaries.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:21.780]   The Jews looked at him, and when they saw certain of his miracles, they said, "I wonder
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.860]   whether this is the Messiah after all?"
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:33.140]   On one occasion he fed 5,000 people with just five loaves and two fishes.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.300]   And they began to talk to one another, and they said, "Isn't this the Messiah?"
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.220]   And then do you remember what they did?
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:46.900]   We are told that they went and they tried to take him by force to make him a king, but
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   he wouldn't have it.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   He shook them off.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:54.380]   He sent his disciples into a boat, and he went up himself alone onto the top of a mountain.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.780]   But you see, that's what they wanted, that's what they expected.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.740]   "Surely," they said, "the Deliverer when he comes will set up his kingdom, he'll proclaim
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:06.740]   himself as king, he'll gather together a great army, he'll destroy the Roman armies, he'll
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:12.340]   introduce and usher in a great kingdom of reform, social, political, economic."
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.700]   That's what they want from him still, that's still the idea, isn't it?
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.220]   But you see, he doesn't do that.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:26.860]   And it was because he didn't do that kind of thing that he not only caused the generality
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:32.140]   of the people to stumble, his own brethren, we are told, stumbled at it.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.860]   They said, "Look here, if you are what you claim to be, why don't you go up to Jerusalem
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.300]   and declare yourself?"
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.140]   John the Baptist even was stumbled.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:45.780]   John in prison sent his two messengers to ask, "Art thou he that should come, or do
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.820]   we look for another?"
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.820]   What did John mean?
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.160]   Well, he meant something like this.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.140]   He said, "If you are the Messiah, why don't you set up your kingdom?
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.260]   Why don't you declare yourself?
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.700]   You're spending your time in Galilee preaching to a handful of ordinary people, speaking
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.420]   to them, working your miracles.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:08.220]   Why don't you do the big things?"
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.660]   But he never did what people expected of him.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.940]   It's always the reversal of everything that we could have imagined or have guessed or
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.460]   have prophesied.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.940]   He preaches to the poor, he's there in distant Galilee, he isn't in Jerusalem, he's not at
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.940]   the center.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.940]   What's the matter?
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.440]   It's the foolishness of God.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.580]   It's God doing the opposite of what men in his wisdom expect.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:41.740]   But I suppose there was nothing more surprising about him than the people with whom he mixed.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.460]   Not only did he not mix with the kings and with the great, you know, he didn't even mix
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.020]   very much with the Pharisees.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.180]   He was ready to speak to them, but he was given the name of "friend of publicans and
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.180]   sinners."
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.740]   At any rate, you would have thought that when the Son of God comes to save, he would have
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.040]   spent his time with the religious, the doctors of the law.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:06.900]   But no, he spends his time, he's a friend of publicans and sinners.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   He eats and drinks with them.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.780]   You see, it reverses all our ideas.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:18.700]   We've got this idea of natural religion and that the Christian is the good man and the
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.620]   man who makes himself better by his own efforts and striving and is religious and this and
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.620]   that and goes on with his old tradition in which he's been brought up and there's the
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.460]   outsider on the street and in the gutter, they've got nothing to do with all this.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.900]   We good people.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:41.540]   My dear friends, it's the very negation of Christianity, not the righteous sinners Jesus
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.860]   came to save.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.860]   They that are hurled, he said, of no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:54.140]   It's the exact opposite always of what people expected, but come to the final point, the
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:36:00.580]   supreme point of this country.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:05.380]   Surely men would have argued if he's come to save and to deliver.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.420]   He must do it in one of these several forms.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:13.720]   He must either do it in that military or economic or social form or else.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:18.260]   He must do it as the disseminator of some great novel, startling idea.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:23.460]   He must be the philosopher of all the philosophers and he will go to the seat of philosophy therefore
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.700]   and promulgate his great teaching.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.660]   He'll set up and say, "Here it is.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.580]   I save you by an idea.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:35.640]   I'm going to rescue you by a word."
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.180]   But you know what happened?
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.220]   He was crucified in weakness.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.940]   They took him.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.940]   They arrested him.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.140]   They tried him.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.660]   They condemned him.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.820]   They nailed him to a tree.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:58.660]   There is your savior, nailed to a tree, helpless, speechless, with a terrible thirst in a great
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.460]   agony, crying out a cry of dereliction.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.740]   The end of everything.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:09.780]   He seems a complete and an abject failure.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:16.140]   But you know, that's his way of saving.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.620]   What's he doing on that cross?
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:27.460]   Putting principalities and powers to shame, making an open show of them, mastering them,
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.620]   conquering them.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.180]   It's there he saves.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:39.300]   Our symbol is a cross, ridiculous, monstrous, no power, no word, no philosophy, weakness,
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.300]   helplessness, death.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:49.400]   But it's by dying he saves.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:55.180]   It's by burying our sins in his own body on the tree that he redeems.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.020]   Oh, men can't understand it.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:07.740]   The clever people standing and looking on said, "Others he saves, himself he cannot
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.740]   save."
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.080]   And that's the last word.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080]   Philosophy has spoken.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:24.740]   He claimed, he did, he cannot, himself, others he saved, himself he cannot save.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:33.620]   Oh, the ignorance, the abject failure to understand that we are not dealing with a man, but with
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.180]   God, not with men's ways of salvation, but with God's way of salvation.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.020]   And it's unlike everything else.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:46.220]   It's folly to the world, a stumbling block to the Jews, foolishness to the Greeks, a
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.960]   dying saviour, a dying carpenter, the saviour of the world.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.300]   But he is.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:03.940]   It's the utter, absolute reversal of everything men have ever thought or imagined or conceived.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.900]   You see it all, you see, illustrated perfectly in him, yes.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:13.220]   But still more is it illustrated, in a sense, in his dealings with men, and in the effect
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.140]   of his gospel upon them.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:24.240]   Here it is for you in the little picture, "I the Lord have brought down the high tree
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.420]   and have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.140]   to flourish."
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:39.860]   The aged Simeon stands there with the infant Jesus in his arms and he looks upon him and
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:50.320]   this is what he says, "This child is set for the fall and the rising again of many
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:57.740]   in Israel, falling, rising, casting down, raising up, it's everywhere in the Bible,
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:05.300]   whether it's trees or people, it's the same message you see."
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:21.180]   He brings to note the things that are, that the things that are not, might become.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:26.260]   Call it paradox if you like, use any terms you please, it doesn't matter, but that's
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.260]   God.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   Turning upside down, reversing, confounding the wisdom of the wise with the foolishness
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.260]   of preaching.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:40.980]   But oh, my dear friends, I wouldn't leave it with you in the realm of a general principle.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.860]   The details here are so important because our whole eternal future depends upon our
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:51.820]   understanding of this, therefore let me put it quite simply and plainly and bluntly.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:57.300]   What is it he does to those who are considered great by the world and considered great by
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.060]   themselves?
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:08.420]   What does he do to those who are self-satisfied and complacent and pleased with themselves?
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.620]   What does he do to those who think they're living a good life and therefore they've
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.620]   got nothing to fear?
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.780]   They say they're ready to meet God and they want to go to heaven.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.940]   What does he say, what does he do to such?
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:27.180]   He brings them down, "I have brought down the high tree, he has made foolish the wisdom
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.180]   of the wise."
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.180]   How?
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.260]   He does it with respect.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.620]   He does it, you know, with respect to their knowledge.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.660]   Man's last citadel is his knowledge.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.300]   Pride of intellect is the last and the ultimate sin.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.740]   And the world today has never been so proud of its knowledge and proud of itself as it
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:55.100]   is at this present time and people are laughing at Christianity and ignoring it and dismissing
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:42:00.580]   it because they think they know.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:07.500]   But the Lord Jesus Christ humbles and brings down the knowledge of men tonight as much
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.660]   as he's ever done.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.620]   Where is the wise?
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.620]   Where is the scribe?
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.500]   Where is the disputer of this world?
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.540]   Let him come forward, says Paul.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540]   Are you interested in knowledge?
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.540]   Well, very well.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.540]   Let's have a discussion.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.540]   Here are the questions.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.540]   What is man?
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.540]   What is life?
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   What is death?
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   What happens beyond death?
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   Where is God?
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   What is God like?
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:55.980]   There are the questions—knowledge, wisdom, philosophy, understanding, the tomes, the
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.500]   display of learning—well, where is the scribe?
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.420]   Where is the disputer of this world?
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.420]   Let him step forward.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.420]   Let him speak.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.420]   Let him tell me.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:11.640]   And the answer is, he doesn't know.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.340]   He doesn't know.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.220]   He doesn't know himself.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.180]   He doesn't know how to live.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.100]   He doesn't know how to die.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.620]   He knows nothing of life beyond death and the grave.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.660]   He doesn't know God.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.900]   He is terribly ignorant, but here is one carpenter of Nazareth, dying on a cross.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.300]   He knows.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.060]   He knows God.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.060]   He knows man.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.460]   He understands.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.820]   He has the knowledge and the information.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.500]   He ridicules the wise.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:53.860]   He brings down their learning and their knowledge.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:44:01.180]   He is still doing it, but somehow men and women don't seem to realize it.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:06.420]   But he is doing it, and you can read the accounts of how he is doing it constantly in your daily
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.340]   newspapers.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.580]   The greatest physician, you know, has to die.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.860]   One of them died the other day.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.940]   No man knew more about disease and illness and things like that than that particular
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:22.940]   man.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:33.060]   My friend put it to me, "Well," he said, "even he had to die."
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:41.080]   On his deathbed he can talk about disease processes, but he didn't talk about God.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.940]   He talked about this life and its illnesses.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.940]   Did he talk about the next life?
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:47.940]   No, no.
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.500]   The wisdom of this world comes to an end.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   It is made to look foolish in the presence of death, and your great men in every realm
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.580]   and department go out silently into the night.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.260]   They don't know the wisdom of this world.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.100]   The knowledge is humbled.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.660]   He throws it down the high tree.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:11.460]   He casts to the floor.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.300]   And it is the same with your morality.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.900]   Let the world talk about its moral codes and its ethics and its behavior.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.980]   And it does.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.820]   And it is because these things are so good and that we can be educated to these things
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.700]   that it hasn't seen the need of that death upon the cross.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.820]   But you know, he ridicules our morality in the same way.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.500]   Take your highest morality, put it by the side of the Ten Commandments, put it by the
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.940]   side of the Sermon on the Mount, put it by the life of Jesus Christ in all his purity
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:49.820]   and glory and in all his wonder and what you find.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:55.180]   Your best men is a miserable world.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:02.420]   Your most moral person is not fit to be spoken of with the same breath.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.340]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.900]   It is our little standards, you see, that make us self-satisfied.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.460]   We think we are so good and nice.
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.060]   Oh, go to God.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:17.780]   Look at God's holiness, that eternal light dwelling in that heaven unto which no man
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.700]   can attain by his own efforts.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   And your little morality will thrivel for nothing as it did in the case of Saul of Tarsus
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.700]   again.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:33.020]   What was so marvelous he saw was nothing but dung, a manure heap, festering and rotting,
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.860]   unworthy of mention.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:45.460]   God brings down our knowledge, he brings down our morality, and he brings down our self-reliance.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:54.140]   We are not only humbled, I say, when thus we compare the knowledge of Christ and his
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:59.660]   teaching and his life and his ethics and his morality.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.900]   We are humbled, as I have already indicated, by the fact of death.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:08.300]   Oh, what a great level of death is.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.300]   High and low, rich and poor, they all go together.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.020]   One that dies without knowledge, says the fiftieth psalm, is like the beasts that perish.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.180]   They just die and they go out.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.180]   They have got nothing.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.620]   They know nothing, as I have said.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.060]   Oh, how we are humbled.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.980]   But our Lord makes even a more thorough work than that.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:31.900]   John the Baptist could see it coming.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.580]   He said, "No, I am not the Messiah."
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.220]   He said, "I am not worthy to undo the latchet of his shoes.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.540]   He shall I indeed baptize you with water.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:47.620]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire, whose fen is in his hand, and
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.740]   he will thoroughly purge his floor.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:58.180]   And the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:04.380]   "No, no," says John, "I am merely the prelude, as it were, the one introducing.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:10.260]   When he comes, he will apply the axe to the root of the tree."
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:15.940]   Not a superficial examination, but this vital examination in the presence of God, and however
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:21.260]   high the tree, he will bring it down, crashing to nothing.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:31.540]   "All our work, we are told, shall be tried by fire, and all wood and hay and stubble
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:38.540]   will be consumed and burnt away, and nothing can stand the fire but the pure gold.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:44.980]   Your alloys, your admixtures, your camouflage, and all that seems like gold will be shown
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.580]   for what it is, and nothing but the pure gold remains.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.900]   Tried us by fire, he will bring down.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:57.580]   He will judge the world, and the great men will all appear before him, and they all will
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:05.260]   be consigned to the punishment that they so richly deserve.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:11.820]   He brings down the high tree, he makes dry the green tree, but oh, thank God that this
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:18.780]   way of salvation is not men's, but is rather God's, for he does the opposite, and I have
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:24.580]   elevated, exalted the low tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish."
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:32.500]   That is the Christian message.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:36.860]   Well it has nothing to say to those who are high and self-satisfied, but that they shall
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.820]   be brought down.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:49.300]   To those who are conscious of failure and smallness and need and ignorance and destitution,
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:54.540]   it has everything to say and everything to offer.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:59.500]   If you are lying in the dust and ashes and ruination of your life, if you have gone wrong
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.540]   morally and in every other respect, and are at the end of your tether and the world has
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:10.620]   turned its back upon you in its respectability, Christ still looks at you and tells you, "He's
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.620]   come to save you."
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:23.920]   He raises the fallen, he elevates the low tree and exalts it and raises it up.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:29.420]   He has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:37.900]   I came, he says, not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.760]   Blessed are the meek, blessed are the poor in spirit, he says.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.120]   Blessed are they that mourn about their sins.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:52.000]   Blessed is the man who knows that he's a terrible failure and full of ignorance and of vileness.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.840]   Blessed is he, blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.860]   They haven't got it, but they hunger and thirst after it.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.640]   They shall be filled.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.540]   What a blessed gospel.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:09.380]   He elevates that which is low, not only that, he gives it life.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.800]   He puts new vigor and power into it.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.880]   He fills it with sap.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:26.880]   I find it difficult always to speak with restraint at this point, but there is no greater travesty
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.760]   of the gospel than that which makes men think that they save themselves by their own efforts.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.640]   You see, it's the exact opposite.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.920]   It is a gospel, it is a message to failures.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:44.640]   A man comes to me and says, "You know, I've sent my very strength and understanding away.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:51.820]   I've drugged my very brain, I can't think, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.600]   My faculties seem to have gone."
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.160]   Do you know the gospel of Christ has got everything to offer even to such a man?
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.000]   It puts new life into him.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.640]   The life of God, the life of Christ, the strength of the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.180]   It's God's action, I say.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.380]   It's not men trying to raise himself up.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:12.520]   It's Christ coming and taking hold of him and infusing his life into him and giving
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.840]   him this new nature and this new power.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:22.240]   And so, as we are told, he makes the dry tree to flourish.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:28.040]   And the abject sinner becomes a saint adorning the church of God.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:36.200]   And the down and out becomes a man who sings the praises of God.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.340]   It is entirely his doing.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.240]   It is altogether his doing.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.600]   You and I have but to receive in our helplessness.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.080]   Whatever you need, he offers it to you.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.920]   He'll give you free pardon and forgiveness.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.740]   You don't earn forgiveness.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.980]   You never can.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:02.880]   If you tried from now until you're dead to earn forgiveness, you never would.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.280]   It's the free gift of God.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.900]   He gives it for nothing.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.600]   Because Christ has suffered for your sins, God will forgive you.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.560]   You'll never, I say, create life divine within yourself.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.440]   God in Christ offers it to you, here and now.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.800]   Not a process, immediate, can be received now.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:27.960]   You have only to see your need and believe his message, you will have it.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:36.340]   It is the complete opposite of everything human, everything natural.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:45.040]   It is God's way of salvation, confounding the wise and the prudent, but elevating the
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:54.960]   babes, the ignorant, the needy, the helpless, the vile, and the poor.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:01.200]   My dear friend, have you realized that that is the gospel?
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:08.840]   The free gift of God's grace in Jesus Christ.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.680]   Do you owe all to him?
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:18.000]   If any man glory, let him glory in the Lord.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.960]   Are you doing so?
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.420]   That's Christianity.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.920]   Everything else is a sham and a pretence.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:36.320]   To be a Christian means that you glory entirely in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and what
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.200]   he has done for you.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   Amen.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.860]   All of the sermons contained within the MLJ Trust Audio Library are now available for
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.280]   free download.
