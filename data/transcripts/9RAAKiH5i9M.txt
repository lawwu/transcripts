[00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.220]   This is a tragedy that we see more and more as a lot of building blocks are starting to get figured out.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.420]   I'm really excited for this next section.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.980]   So we'll be doing a fireside chat with Andrew, and Andrew probably doesn't need any introduction to most of us here.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.620]   I'm guessing a lot of people can begin some of his classes, even with Sarah, or deep learning.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.440]   But Andrew has been a big part of the LinkedIn story.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.340]   So I met Andrew a little over two years ago at a conference, and we started talking about LinkedIn.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.600]   And he graciously invited us to do a course on LinkedIn deep learning.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.000]   I think it must have been the second or third one that they ever did.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.520]   And I know a lot of people here would probably watch that course or have started on LinkedIn because of that course.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.440]   So Andrew has been a huge part of the LinkedIn journey.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.160]   And I'm super excited to welcome him on stage for a fireside chat.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.500]   So let's welcome Andrew in.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:25.480]   Thank you.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   You've obviously touched and thought about so many things in this industry, but one of your takes that I cite a lot, and probably people have talked about,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   is your take on kind of like talking about the agenticness of an application as opposed to whether something's an agent.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:04.740]   And so, you know, as we're here now at an agent conference, maybe we should rename it to an agentic conference, but would you mind kind of like clarify that?
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.420]   Yeah, I think it was like almost a year and a half, two years ago that you said that, and so I'm curious if things have changed in your mind since then.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.420]   So I remember that, and so I remember an agent.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:22.420]   I mentioned that Harrison and I spoke at a conference in a year and over a year ago, and at that time, I think both of us were trying to convince other people that agents are a thing you should pay attention to.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:33.420]   And that was before maybe, I think it was mid-summer last year, a bunch of lawmakers got an agentic term and start to see that sticker everywhere there was.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.420]   So I heard this question, I think about a year and a half ago, I saw that long people are arguing, this is an agent, this is not a different, you know.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:51.420]   My friends, this is a chain of conference that's an agent. And I felt that the response had an argument, but that we would succeed that as a community would just say that the decrease from something is agentic.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.420]   So, and then we just say that if you want to go on an agentic system, move autonomy or a lot of autonomy is all fine.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.420]   No need to spend time arguing, this is truly an agent. Let's just call all these things agentic systems with different degrees of autonomy.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.420]   And I think that actually, hopefully, producing a lot of autonomy people, at least spend time arguing some as an agent.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.420]   And this is common for agenting when they're young. And I think that should run down.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.420]   Where on that spectrum of kind of like a little autonomy to a lot of autonomy do you see people building towards this?
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.420]   Yeah. So, my team, your team uses mangrove for a hardest problem during complex values and so on.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.420]   I'm also seeing tons of digital opportunities that, frankly, are fairly linear of workflows or linear with just occasional cyber actions.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.420]   So, one of the businesses, there are opportunities where you're running down with people looking to form a website,
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.420]   doing web search, checking something within the piece to see if it's a compliance issue or if there are, you know, some machine, some service up to.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.420]   And it's kind of a, well, take something, copy-paste it into a web search, or something different.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.420]   So, in business processes, there are actually a lot of fairly linear workflows or linear with very small reasonable educational branches.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.420]   Usually, you couldn't do a failure with some of the agentless workflow.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:22.420]   So, I see a lot of articulation, but one challenge I see businesses have is it's still pretty difficult to look at, you know, some stuff that's being done in US and figure out how to turn it into a agentic workflow.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.420]   So, what is the granularity?
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.420]   You know, we should try to bring down the school into micro tasks.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.420]   And then, you know, after you build your initial prototype, if it doesn't work well enough,
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.420]   and which of these steps do you work on to improve performance?
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.420]   So, I think that whole bag of skills on how to look at a bunch of stuff that people are doing,
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.420]   break into sequential steps, where are the small number of branches, how do you put in place evals, you know, all that.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.420]   that skill set is still .
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.420]   And then, of course, there's a much more complex .
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.420]   I think you heard a bunch of very complex groups that's very valuable as well.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.420]   But, I see much more in terms of number of opportunities, the amount of value.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.420]   There's a lot of simpler efforts that I think are still being used as well.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.420]   Let's talk about some of those skills.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.420]   Like, so, you've been doing deep learning.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.420]   I think a lot of courses are in pursuit of helping people kind of like building.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:25.420]   And so, what are some of the skills that you think agent builders all across this sector should kind of like master and get started with?
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.420]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.420]   I wish I could answer that.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.420]   I've been thinking a lot about this, actually.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:40.420]   I think one of the challenges, if you have a business process, you often have people who comply with people in the job, whatever, these steps.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.420]   How do you put in place the, you know, through the MacGraph type integration,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.420]   you want to see if you have CPP also some of that too, to adjust the data.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.420]   And then, how do you process or process multiple steps,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.420]   be able to build this into a system?
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.420]   And one thing I see a lot is putting in place the record key balance framework
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.420]   to not only to understand the performance of the overall system,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   but to trace the individual steps.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.420]   You can pull in on what's the one step that is broken,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.420]   what's the outcome that's broken to work on.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.420]   I find that a lot of teams probably way longer than they should,
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.420]   just using human devalance.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.420]   Every time you change something, you can sit there and look at a bunch of awkward scenes, right?
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.420]   I see most teams probably slower to put in place and develop,
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.420]   systematic development is ideal.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.420]   But I find that having the United States or one to two days in the project is still really difficult.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.420]   The skill teams, the teams are still learning skills,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.420]   they often, you know, go down the line now, it's very recent,
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.420]   like a few months, trying to improve one for more.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.420]   And then more students will say, you know what,
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.420]   I don't think this could ever be made to work.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.420]   So just don't, just find the different variables as well.
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.420]   I wish I knew, I wish I knew, I knew more efficiently,
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.420]   to get this almost tactile knowledge.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.420]   Often you're there, you know, look at the output,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.420]   look at the trace, look at the length of the output,
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.420]   and just try to make a decision, right?
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.420]   It is a lot harder to mix, and that's still very difficult.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   And is this kind of like tactile knowledge mostly around LLMs and their limitations,
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.420]   more around like just the product framing of things,
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.420]   and that skill of taking a job and breaking it down,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.420]   that's something that we're still getting accustomed to.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.420]   I think it's all the way well, actually.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.420]   So I feel like over the last couple of years,
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.420]   AI tool companies have created an amazing set of AI tools.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.420]   this includes tools like, you know, that graph,
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.420]   but also, how do you, I guess like, how do you think about RAN?
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.420]   How do you think about the chat box?
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.420]   Many, many different ways of approaching memory.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.420]   What else, how do you need those?
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.420]   How do you got your else?
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.420]   But I feel like there's this, you know,
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.420]   wild, sprawling array of really exciting tools.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.420]   One picture I often have in my head is,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.420]   if all you have are, you know, purple Lego bricks, right?
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.420]   If you can't build that much, you just say stop.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.420]   But, and then think of these tools as being a kind of Lego bricks, right?
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.420]   And the one tools you have is as if, you know, just a purple Lego bricks,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.420]   but the red one, the black one, and the yellow one, the green one.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.420]   And as you get more different colored and shaped Lego bricks,
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.420]   you can very quickly assemble them into really cool things.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.420]   And so I think a lot of these tools,
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.420]   maybe one's that's wrapped in progress,
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.420]   different types of Lego bricks.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.420]   And when you're trying to build something, you know,
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.420]   sometimes you need that right squiggly weird shaped Lego brick,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.420]   and some people go and they can fuck with it
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.420]   and just get the job done.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.420]   But if you never build evals of a certain time,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.420]   then, you know, then you can actually end up spending,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.420]   like a few extra months to do something that someone else
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.420]   that's done that before could say,
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.420]   "Oh, wow, I should just put a few thousand strangers
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.420]   and I'll just judge."
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.420]   And just go through that process and get it that much faster.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.420]   So, one of the unfortunate things about AI,
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.420]   it's not just one tool.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.420]   When I'm coding, I just use a whole bunch of different stuff, right?
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.420]   I'm not a master.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.420]   I've stuck myself up with enough tools to sell that.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.420]   So, yeah, and I think having that practice
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.420]   with different tools,
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   but also helps .
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.420]   And one of the things, they've also changed.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   So, for example,
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.420]   just all of a sudden,
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.420]   have no longer, longer context.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.420]   And a lot of the best practices from rag,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.420]   from, you know, a year and a half ago,
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.420]   or whatever,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   are much less relevant today.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.420]   And I remember, Harrison was really ready
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.420]   to talk about these things,
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.420]   and play with the early managing rag frameworks
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.420]   across this organization and all that.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.420]   that, as the content release got longer,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.420]   now we've just done a lot of stuff into our content.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.420]   It's not that rag has gone away,
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.420]   but the hyperpractic team has gotten way easier.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.420]   There's a huge range of hyperpractors
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.420]   that work, you know, like, just fine.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.420]   So, as algorithms keep harvesting,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   the instincts we hold, you know,
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.420]   two years ago,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.420]   which may only not be relevant
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   than you want today.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.420]   You mentioned a lot of things
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.420]   that I want to talk about.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.420]   So, okay, what are some of the Lego bricks
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   that are maybe underrated right now
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   that you would recommend
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   that people aren't talking about?
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.420]   Like evals, I think, you know,
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.420]   we had three people talk about evals,
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   and I think that's top of people's mind.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.420]   But what are some things
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.420]   that most people maybe haven't thought of
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   or haven't heard of yet
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.420]   that you would recommend that we're going into?
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.420]   Good question.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.420]   I don't know.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.420]   I want to share this.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.420]   So, even though people talk about evals,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.420]   there's some ways that people don't do it.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.420]   Why don't they do it?
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.420]   I think it's because people often have,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.420]   I saw a post on evals rights as well.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.420]   People think of writing evals
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.420]   as this huge thing you have to do, right?
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.420]   I think of evals as something
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   I'm going to fill together really quickly,
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   you know, in 20 minutes.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.420]   And it's not that good,
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.420]   but it starts to complement
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.420]   my human eyeball evals.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.420]   And so what often happens
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.420]   is our system and this one problem
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   that I keep on getting regression.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.420]   I thought I made it work,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.420]   then it breaks.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.420]   I'm here, I embrace it.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.420]   I've done it.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.420]   Then I call it a very simple eval,
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.420]   maybe with, you know,
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.420]   five different examples
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.420]   in some very simple eval situation
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.420]   to just check for this one regression,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.420]   right?
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.420]   This one thing, right?
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.420]   And then I'm not swapping out human evals
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   for automated evals.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.420]   I'm still looking open myself,
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.420]   but when I change something,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   I don't want to see evals
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.420]   to just, you know,
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.420]   take this word into something
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.420]   psychopathic and think about it.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.420]   And then what happens is,
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.420]   just like the way we write English maybe,
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.420]   once you have some slightly helpful
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.420]   but clearly very broken,
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   imperfect eval,
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.420]   then you start going,
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   you know what?
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   I can improve my eval
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.420]   to make it better.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   I can improve to make it better.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.420]   So just as when we build
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.420]   the public applications,
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.420]   we build some, you know,
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.420]   very quick and dirty thing
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.420]   that doesn't work
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   and we could make it better.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420]   For a long of the way,
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.420]   I built evals.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.420]   I built really awful evals
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.420]   that barely helps.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.420]   and then when you look at what it does,
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.420]   you can go, you know,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.420]   it's this email's broken.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   I can fix it.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.420]   And you can improve it for you
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420]   to make it better.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.420]   So that's one thing.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.420]   Actually, one thing that people
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.420]   have talked a lot about
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.420]   and I think is so automated
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.420]   is the voice stack.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   It's one of the things
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.420]   that I'm actually very excited
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.420]   about voice applications.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.420]   A lot of my friends are very excited
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.420]   about voice applications.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.420]   I see a bunch of large enterprises
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.420]   really excited about voice applications,
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.420]   very large enterprises,
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.420]   very large users.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.420]   For some reason,
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.420]   while there are some developers
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   in this community
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.420]   doing voice
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.420]   the amount of developer attention
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.420]   on voice stack applications,
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.420]   there is some, right?
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.420]   It's not really important,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.420]   but that's one thing
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.420]   that feels much smaller
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.420]   than the large enterprise
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   importance I see
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   as well as applications
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   going along the way.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.420]   And not all of this
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.420]   is the low-time voice in here.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   It's not all speech-to-speech
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   native volume
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.420]   or volume or volume.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420]   because I find those models
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.420]   are very hard to control,
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.420]   but when we use
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.420]   more of an agenting
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.420]   voice stack workflow,
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   which is great,
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.420]   which we find
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.420]   much more controllable.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.420]   Boy,
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.420]   ADFM work with a ton of teams
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   on voice stack stuff
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.420]   that some of which
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.420]   hopefully be announcing
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.420]   the future of us
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.420]   seeing all the very exciting things.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.420]   And then,
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.420]   other things I think
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.420]   underrated,
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.420]   one of the ones
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.420]   that maybe is not underrated
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.420]   but no others should do it,
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.420]   I think many of you have seen
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.420]   that developers
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.420]   developers
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.420]   using AI systems
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.420]   about coding
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   is so much faster
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   than developers
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.420]   and don't.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   I've been,
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.420]   it's been interesting
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   to see how many companies
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.420]   CIOs and CTOs
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.420]   still have policies
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.420]   that don't let engineers
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.420]   use AI systems
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.420]   going.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   to improve.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   I think,
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.420]   maybe sometimes
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.420]   are good reasons,
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.420]   but I think we have
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.420]   to go across that
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:39.420]   because,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   frankly,
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   I don't know,
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.420]   my teams
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.420]   and I just hate
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.420]   about the coding
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.420]   on AI assistants.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.420]   So,
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.420]   I think,
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.420]   some of this is something
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.420]   that you have to do.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:49.420]   I think
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.420]   underrated
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.420]   is the idea
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.420]   that I think everyone
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.420]   should learn to code.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.420]   One fun fact
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.420]   about AI fund,
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.420]   everyone in AI fund,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.420]   including,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.420]   you know,
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.420]   the person that runs
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.420]   our front desk,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.420]   receptionist,
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.420]   and my CFO,
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.420]   and my attorney,
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.420]   and the general counsel,
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.420]   everyone in AI fund
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.420]   actually knows how to code.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.420]   And,
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420]   it's not that one
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.420]   that you're salvaged,
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.420]   is there not,
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.420]   but in their respective
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.420]   job functions,
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.420]   maybe as a mother
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.420]   or a home code,
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.420]   that's able
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.420]   to tell a computer
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   what they want
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.420]   to do.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   And so,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.420]   it's actually driving
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.420]   more productivity
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.420]   progress
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.420]   across all of these
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.420]   job functions
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.420]   that are not salvaged.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.420]   So,
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.420]   that's an exciting result.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.420]   Talking about
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.420]   kind of like
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.420]   AI coding,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.420]   how,
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.420]   what tools are you using
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.420]   for that,
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.420]   personally?
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.420]   So,
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.420]   so,
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.420]   we're,
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.420]   working on some things
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.420]   that are not getting
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.420]   announced.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.420]   Exciting.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   So,
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.420]   maybe,
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.420]   I,
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.420]   I,
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.420]   I do use
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.420]   Cursor,
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.420]   Ritzer,
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.420]   um,
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.420]   um,
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.420]   um,
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.420]   that's some of the things.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.420]   All right.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.420]   Talking about voice.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.420]   If,
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.420]   if people here
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.420]   want to get into voice
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.420]   and they're familiar
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.420]   with building kind of
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.420]   like agents with LLMs,
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.420]   how,
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.420]   how similar is it?
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.420]   Are there a lot of ideas
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   people,
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.420]   all they have to learn?
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:08.420]   Yeah,
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.420]   so,
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.420]   in terms of,
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.420]   there are a lot of applications
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.420]   where I think voices,
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.420]   you know,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.420]   increase certain interactions,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.420]   um,
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.420]   that,
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.420]   um,
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.420]   that are not much more.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.420]   It,
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.420]   it turns out that,
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.420]   uh,
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.420]   it turns out from an application
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.420]   perspective,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.420]   um,
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.420]   it turns out that this problem
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.420]   is kind of intimidating,
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.420]   right?
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.420]   For other applications,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.420]   people can say,
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.420]   tell me what you think,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.420]   here's a block of text problem,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.420]   read a bunch of texts from you.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   That's actually very intimidating
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.420]   for users.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.420]   And one of the problems
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.420]   with that is,
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.420]   um,
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.420]   people can use backspace,
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.420]   and so,
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:39.420]   you know,
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.420]   people aren't just as little
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.420]   learned to respond by the text.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.420]   Whereas,
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.420]   the voice,
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   you know,
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.420]   girls fall in,
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   and she said,
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.420]   "If you're talking,
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.420]   you could change your mind."
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.420]   And I say,
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.420]   "Oh, I changed my mind,
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420]   forget everything."
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.420]   And I find that,
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.420]   um,
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.420]   the lot of applications
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.420]   for the user friction
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.420]   to just getting them
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.420]   to use it
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.420]   is lower.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:00.420]   You say,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.420]   "You know,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.420]   tell me what you think."
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.420]   And then they respond.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.420]   Um,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.420]   so,
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.420]   in terms of voice,
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   one of the biggest difference
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.420]   is,
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.420]   um,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   in terms of,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.420]   um,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420]   if you can,
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.420]   if someone says something,
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.420]   you know,
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   they want to respond in,
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   you know,
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   some point a second,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   right?
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.420]   Less than 50 milliseconds
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.420]   is great,
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   but I agree,
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   I'm using some point a second.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.420]   And with a lot of,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.420]   um,
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.420]   agents,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.420]   they weren't closed,
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.420]   they were run for,
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.420]   many seconds.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.420]   So,
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.420]   when 2009
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.420]   wanted to grow Avatar
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.420]   to build an Avatar,
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.420]   if you want,
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.420]   um,
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.420]   um,
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   our initial version
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.420]   had kind of
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.420]   five to nine seconds
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.420]   of literacy.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.420]   And it's,
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.420]   and it's just a bad
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.420]   user experience.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.420]   You say something,
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   you know,
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   nine seconds aside,
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.420]   the Avatar response,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.420]   but so we wanted to
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   build things like,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.420]   um,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.420]   uh,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.420]   how to create response.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.420]   So just as,
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.420]   you know,
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.420]   if you ask me a question,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.420]   I might go,
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.420]   huh,
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.420]   that's interesting.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   So,
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.420]   we wanted to basically do that
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.420]   to hide the latency,
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.420]   um,
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.420]   and it actually seems
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.420]   to work great.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.420]   And there are all these other
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.420]   little tricks as well.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   Turns out,
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.420]   we're building a voice,
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.420]   um,
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.420]   customer service chatbot.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.420]   it turns out that
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.420]   when you play background voice,
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.420]   at a customer contact center,
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.420]   it's a dense silence,
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.420]   people are much more sensitive
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.420]   on that,
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.420]   of that,
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:15.420]   you know,
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   latency.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.420]   So I find that there are
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.420]   a lot of these things that,
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.420]   um,
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.420]   um,
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.420]   that are different than a
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.420]   pure text based element.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   but in applications,
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.420]   for a voice based modality,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   there's some reason to be comfortable
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.420]   and just not talking.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.420]   Um,
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.420]   I think it sometimes reduces
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   user friction.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.420]   So,
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:32.420]   you know,
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.420]   getting some information
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.420]   out of them.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.420]   Save,
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.420]   I think when we talk,
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.420]   we don't feel like
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.420]   we need to deliver perfection
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.420]   as much as we operate.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.420]   Um,
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.420]   so it's somehow easier
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.420]   to really just start blurting
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.420]   on your ideas
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.420]   and change your mind
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   and go back and fail.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.420]   And that lets us get
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420]   the information from them
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.420]   that we need
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   to help the user too.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.420]   that's interesting.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.420]   Ah, wow.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.420]   One of the,
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   one of the new things
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.420]   that's out there,
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.420]   you mentioned briefly,
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.420]   is MCP.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   How are you seeing
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.420]   that transform
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.420]   how people are building apps?
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.420]   What types of apps are building
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.420]   and what's happening
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.420]   in any business?
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.420]   Yeah,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.420]   so I think it's really exciting.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   Um,
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.420]   just this morning,
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.420]   we released with Anthropi
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.420]   and my show was on MCP.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   Um,
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   uh,
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.420]   I actually saw a lot of,
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.420]   uh,
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.420]   stuff,
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.420]   you know,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.420]   on MCP
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.420]   that I thought
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.420]   was quite confusing.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.420]   So,
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.420]   when we got through Anthropi
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:24.420]   we said,
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.420]   you know,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.420]   let's get really good
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.420]   shortfalls on MCP
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   that explains it clearly.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.420]   I think MCP
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.420]   is fantastic.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.420]   I think it's a very clear market
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   that,
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   you know,
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.420]   that Okunai
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.420]   adopted it.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.420]   Also,
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:36.420]   I think speaks
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   the importance of this.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420]   Um,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.420]   I think the MCP standard
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   will continue to evolve,
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   right?
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.420]   So,
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.420]   for example,
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   I think one of you,
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.420]   many of you know what MCP is,
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   right?
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   Makes it much easier
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.420]   engines primarily,
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.420]   but frankly,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.420]   other types of software
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.420]   to plug into different types of data.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   When I'm using Elvis myself
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.420]   or when I'm building applications,
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.420]   frankly,
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.420]   for a lot of us,
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   we spend so much time
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.420]   on plumbing,
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.420]   right?
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   So I think,
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.420]   for those of you from Bosch enterprises as well,
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.420]   the AI,
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.420]   especially,
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.420]   you know,
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.420]   are like pretty darn intelligent
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.420]   to do a lot of stuff
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.420]   when given the right context.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.420]   But so,
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.420]   I found that,
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.420]   I spent,
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.420]   my team spent a lot of time
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.420]   working and plumbing
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.420]   on the data integration
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.420]   so you get the context
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.420]   to make it feel
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.420]   to do something
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.420]   that often is pretty sensible
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.420]   when it's perfect in the context.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.420]   So,
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.420]   MCP,
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.420]   I think is a fantastic way
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.420]   to try to standardize
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.420]   the interface.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.420]   So,
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420]   tools,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.420]   API calls,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.420]   as well as the responses.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420]   It feels like,
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.420]   it feels a little bit like,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   wow,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   that's,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.420]   you know,
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   a lot of MCP services
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.420]   you find the internet
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.420]   do not work,
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:41.420]   right?
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.420]   and the authentication systems
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.420]   are kind of,
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.420]   you know,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   even for the very large companies,
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.420]   you know,
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420]   MCP services,
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   the company is not clear
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.420]   and you know,
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.420]   authentication token,
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.420]   token works,
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.420]   it's biased,
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.420]   a lot of that going on.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.420]   I think the MCP protocol itself
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.420]   is also early.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.420]   Right now,
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.420]   MCP gives a long list
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.420]   of the resources
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.420]   that will,
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.420]   you know,
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.420]   eventually,
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.420]   I think,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.420]   multiple,
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.420]   you know,
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.420]   I don't know,
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.420]   you know,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   I don't know,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.420]   I don't know,
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   the MCP,
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.420]   it is,
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.420]   the land graph,
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.420]   the land graph
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   has so many API calls,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.420]   you just,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.420]   you can't have like,
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.420]   a long list of everything
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.420]   under the sun,
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.420]   for an agent to sort out,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   and so,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.420]   I think MCP is a really fantastic
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.420]   first step,
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.420]   definitely encourage you to learn about it,
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.420]   that will make your life easier,
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.420]   probably,
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.420]   if you find a good MCP server
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.420]   implementation,
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.420]   so how it's on the data integrations.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   And I think,
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.420]   I think what we're important,
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   is this,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.420]   this idea of,
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.420]   when you have,
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.420]   you know,
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.420]   N models,
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.420]   or N agents,
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   and N data sources,
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.420]   it should not be
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   N times N method,
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.420]   to do all the integrations,
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.420]   N plus N,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.420]   and I think MCP
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   is a,
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.420]   is a fantastic first step,
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.420]   it will need to evolve,
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.420]   like a fantastic first step,
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.420]   to one that type of data integration.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.420]   Another type of protocol,
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420]   that seemed less fun,
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.420]   than MCP,
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.420]   is some of the,
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.420]   agent to agent stuff,
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   and I remember,
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.420]   when we,
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   when we were at a conference,
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420]   a year or so ago,
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.420]   I think you were talking about,
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   multi-agent systems,
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.420]   which this was kind of enabled,
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.420]   so,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.420]   how do you see some of the,
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.420]   multi-agent,
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.420]   or agent to agent stuff,
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   of all of that?
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.420]   So,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.420]   I think,
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.420]   you know,
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   the agent to AI,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.420]   is still similar to me,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.420]   both of us,
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   right,
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.420]   we,
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.420]   we struggle,
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.420]   giving our code work,
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.420]   and so,
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.420]   making my code,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.420]   my agent work,
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.420]   with someone else's agent,
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.420]   it feels like,
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.420]   a two miracle,
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.420]   you know,
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.420]   .
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.420]   So,
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.420]   I see that,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.420]   when one team is building,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420]   a multi-agent system,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   that often works,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   because we build,
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.420]   a bunch of agents,
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.420]   they could meet themselves,
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   that works,
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   but,
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.420]   right now,
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.420]   at least at this moment in time,
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   maybe I'm off,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.420]   the number of examples I've seen,
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.420]   of when,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.420]   you know,
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.420]   one team's agent,
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   and correctional agents,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.420]   successfully engaged,
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   totally different teams,
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.420]   agent and correctional agents,
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   I think we're a little bit,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   early to that,
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.420]   I'm sure we'll get there,
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.420]   but I'm not,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.420]   personally seeing,
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.420]   you know,
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   real success,
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.420]   huge success stories,
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.420]   of that,
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.420]   yet,
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.420]   I'm not sure,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.420]   no,
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.420]   I agree,
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.420]   it's,
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.420]   I think it's super early,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.420]   I think,
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   if MCP is early,
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.420]   I think,
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.420]   the new page and stuff,
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.420]   is just earlier.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.420]   Another thing,
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   that's kind of like,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420]   top of,
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   what's mine right now,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.420]   is it's kind of,
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.420]   vibe coding,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.420]   and all that,
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.420]   and you touched on it,
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   a little bit earlier,
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.420]   with how people are using,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.420]   these AI coding assistants,
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.420]   but,
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.420]   how do you think about,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.420]   vibe coding,
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   is that a different skill,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420]   than before,
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   or what kind of purpose,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   does that serve,
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.420]   in the world?
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.420]   code,
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.420]   you know,
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420]   barely looking at the code,
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   right,
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   I think it's a fantastic thing,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   I think it's unfortunate,
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420]   that that called,
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.420]   fine coding,
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.420]   because it's,
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   just leaving a lot of people,
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.420]   and I'm thinking,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   just go to the vibes,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420]   you know,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.420]   and frankly,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.420]   when I'm coding,
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.420]   for a day,
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   you know,
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.420]   with fine coding,
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   or whatever,
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.420]   with AI coding assistants,
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   I'm frankly exhausted,
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   by the end of the day,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   from TV,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.420]   intellectual exercise,
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.420]   and so,
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   I think the name is unfortunate,
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420]   but the phenomenon,
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.420]   in this world,
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   is great,
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420]   so,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   I,
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.420]   I,
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.420]   over the last year,
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.420]   a few people,
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   have been advising,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   others,
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.420]   to not learn to code,
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   on the basis,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   that they have more,
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   to be in coding,
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.420]   I think,
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:14.420]   I look back,
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.420]   at some of the worst,
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.420]   career advice,
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   ever,
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   because,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.420]   over the last,
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   many decades,
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.420]   is coding,
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:21.420]   easier,
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.420]   more people,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   started to code,
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.420]   so,
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.420]   it turns out,
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.420]   you know,
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   when we went,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   from punch cards,
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.420]   to keyboards,
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.420]   that turned them off,
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   very well,
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.420]   but,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.420]   it turns out,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   one of the most important,
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   the most important schools,
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.420]   in the future,
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.420]   for developers,
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   and not developers,
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   is the ability,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.420]   to tell them about,
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   exactly what you want,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.420]   so,
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.420]   to improve,
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.420]   and,
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420]   I think,
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.420]   understanding,
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.420]   at some level,
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.420]   how computer works,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   lets you,
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.420]   probably,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.420]   to improve,
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   and,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.420]   I think,
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.420]   understanding,
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   at some level,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   how computer works,
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   lets you,
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   probably,
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   to improve,
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.420]   and,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.420]   to improve,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.420]   and,
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.420]   I think,
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.420]   understanding,
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.420]   at some level,
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   how computer works,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.420]   lets you,
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.420]   probably,
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   to improve,
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.420]   and,
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.420]   to improve,
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   and,
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.420]   which is why,
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   I still,
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.420]   try to advise everyone,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.420]   to learn,
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   one part of the migration,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.420]   and Python,
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   or something,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.420]   and then,
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.420]   I think,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   I personally,
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.420]   about,
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.420]   a much stronger,
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.420]   Python developer,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   than,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   say,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.420]   JavaScript,
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   right?
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.420]   But,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.420]   with,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.420]   AI system coding,
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.420]   I now write,
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   a lot more JavaScript,
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.420]   types of code,
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   than I ever used to,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   but,
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   even with debugging,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   JavaScript code,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.420]   than something else,
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.420]   building,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   that's,
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.420]   really,
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   understanding,
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   you know,
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.420]   what an error case is,
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   what does this mean,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.420]   that,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.420]   that's,
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   really,
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.420]   .
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.420]   If you,
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.420]   if you don't like the,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   name,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.420]   do you have a better name,
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.420]   than mine?
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.420]   That's a good question.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.420]   I shouldn't think about that.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.420]   We'll,
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.420]   we'll get back to you on that.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.420]   Good question.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.420]   One,
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.420]   of the things that,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.420]   you announced recently,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.420]   is a new fund,
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.420]   so,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.420]   congrats on that.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.420]   Were people,
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.420]   in the audience,
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.420]   who are going to be thinking,
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.420]   of starting a startup,
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.420]   or,
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.420]   looking into that,
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.420]   what advice,
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.420]   for them?
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   So,
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.420]   I think,
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.420]   it was an interest to do,
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.420]   investment companies,
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.420]   that we co-founded.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.420]   So,
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.420]   I think,
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.420]   in terms of,
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   looking back on,
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.420]   lessons learned,
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.420]   the number one,
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.420]   I would say,
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   the number one,
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.420]   predictor,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.420]   of a startup success,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.420]   is,
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   speed.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.420]   I know,
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.420]   it's looking at value,
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.420]   but I see a lot of people,
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   that I've never seen yet,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.420]   the speed,
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   with which a skilled team,
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.420]   can execute.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.420]   And,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.420]   if you've never seen it before,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   I know many of you have seen it,
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.420]   it's just so much faster,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   than,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.420]   you know,
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   anything that,
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.420]   slow businesses,
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.420]   you know,
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   how they do,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.420]   and I think the number two,
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.420]   predictor,
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   also very important,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.420]   is,
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.420]   technical knowledge.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.420]   It turns out,
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   we look at the skills,
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420]   to some things,
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   like,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.420]   how you market,
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.420]   how you sell,
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   how you price,
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420]   you know,
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   all that is important,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   but that knowledge,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   has become a little bit more,
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   widespread.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.420]   The knowledge that's really rare,
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.420]   is,
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.420]   how does technology actually work,
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   so quickly?
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.420]   So,
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.420]   I have deep respect,
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.420]   of good luck,
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.420]   and people,
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.420]   when pricing is hard,
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.420]   you know,
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.420]   marketing is hard,
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.420]   position is hard,
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.420]   but that knowledge,
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   is more diffuse,
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   and the most rare resource,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   is someone,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   that really understands,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.420]   how the technology,
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.420]   grows.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.420]   So,
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.420]   when I find,
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.420]   technical people,
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.420]   that have good instincts,
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.420]   or understands,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   do this,
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   don't do that,
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   do this,
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.420]   go twice as fast.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.420]   And then,
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.420]   I think,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.420]   a lot of the business stuff,
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   you know,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.420]   back to the college,
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.420]   it's very important,
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.420]   it's usually easier,
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.420]   to figure out something.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   Alright,
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.420]   that's great advice,
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.420]   for sharing something.
