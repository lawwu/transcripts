[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Please join me in welcoming Graham Allison to the stage.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Thank you.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.500]   Wow.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Allegra winners ride.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.500]   Rain Man David Sackett.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And it said--
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   We open sourced it to the fans, and they've just gone crazy.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Love you guys.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I see Queenie Kinloch.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Really an honor.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500]   Graham, thanks for joining us, and thanks for agreeing
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500]   to follow that routine.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500]   Graham Allison was founding dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000]   School of Government and remains a professor of government.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500]   He's a leading analyst of US national security and defense
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500]   policy with a special interest in nuclear weapons
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000]   and terrorism.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500]   He's most famous as the Assistant Secretary of Defense
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.000]   for Policy and Plans from 1993 to '94,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500]   where he coordinated strategy and policy towards the states
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000]   of the former Soviet Union.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Bill Clinton awarded him the Department of Defense Medal
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   for Distinguished Public Service for reshaping relations
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500]   with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000]   to reduce the former Soviet nuclear arsenal.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500]   And he's since become the longest serving member
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.000]   of the Secretary of Defense's Defense Policy Board,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   having served for eight secretaries of defense.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And he's the only person to receive the Department
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   of Defense's highest civilian award from both Reagan
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and Clinton administrations.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500]   Graham is one of the world's most cited experts
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   on the bureaucratic analysis of decision making,
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000]   especially during times of crisis.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   I read his book, Destined for War--
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000]   Can America and China Escape Thucydides' Trap?,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   which was published in 2018 and I think was very prescient
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.500]   about the moment that we're in today.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500]   A couple of weeks ago, Elon Musk tweeted out several times
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.000]   that everyone should read this book.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So congrats.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We get a little promotion from Elon as well.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.500]   Thank you.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   That must have helped sales.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   Congrats on that.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000]   The theory that when one great power threatens
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500]   to displace another, war is almost always the result,
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   is at the heart of his analysis on the U.S.-China relationship.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.000]   During the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides wrote,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.500]   "What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.000]   and the fear which this caused in Sparta."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.500]   And Graham says the trap triggered nearly every war,
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.000]   from the Peloponnesian War to World War I,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.500]   to the War of the Spanish Succession,
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   the Thirty Years' War, and now threatens
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   to light the world on fire once again.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   Graham, thanks for joining us today.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   If you wouldn't mind, just frame for the audience
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   and for us here on stage the point that you make in your book
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   about Thucydides' trap and where we find the relationship
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   between China and the U.S. taking us,
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   and where it specifically sits in that evolution of,
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   call it temperament, today.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And it's a pleasure and honor to be here.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.500]   I'm a fan of your podcast,
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.000]   and I think how you've made this thing work,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.500]   I don't quite understand, but I appreciate it.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   We have a friend in the deep state.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.000]   He's sitting over there.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.500]   We're not going to name names,
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.000]   but he made the introduction, and we appreciate it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.500]   In any case, it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000]   And the summary you gave, I think, is a very good place to start.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.500]   Let me do four or five quick bottom lines.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.000]   The first, as I wrote in this book,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   which was published just as Trump became president,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   in Relations Between the U.S. and China,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   expect things to get worse before they get worse.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.500]   (laughter)
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's exactly what I would say today.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.500]   And why? What's driving that?
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.000]   This is a classic Thucydidean rivalry.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   As David said, Thucydides taught us 2,500 years ago
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   that when a rapidly rising power seriously threatens
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.500]   to displace a ruling power, shit happens.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.000]   That's normal.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And in most cases, the outcome is war.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So what we're seeing today
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.500]   and what we're going to see even more intensely tomorrow
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   and a decade from now
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   is the fiercest rivalry history has ever seen.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.000]   China is not just another great power,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.500]   but it's going to be the biggest power in the history of the world.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.000]   The U.S. is a colossal ruling power,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   which has been the architect and guardian
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   of the international order
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.500]   that allows us to live today in the 78th year
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   without great power war--
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.000]   a pretty amazing accomplishment.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And so the U.S. is not going to fade away comfortably.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   When that confrontation occurs,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   most often the outcome is war.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   In the book I look at that last 500 years,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   there's 16 times we've seen a rapidly rising power
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.500]   threaten a colossal ruling power.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.000]   Think of Germany's rise beginning of the 20th century
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and the challenge to Great Britain.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   That became World War I.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.500]   So most often, of the 16 cases, 12 ended in war.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.000]   Four ended in no war.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.500]   So if we were just doing statistics,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.000]   war is not inevitable.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.500]   It's just structurally likely.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.000]   And the cases in which war didn't occur
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   were cases in which somehow
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   the parties managed a degree of strategic imagination
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.500]   that bent otherwise trends,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.000]   or what you called earlier the physics of the situation.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So, the Cold War. I'm an old Cold Warrior.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   In the rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   that had dominated 40 years of American history,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   the U.S. and the Soviet Union came to the edge of war
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.500]   multiple times, Cuban Missile Crisis,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   about which I've written a book, The Most Dangerous.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   But there was ultimately no hot war.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   Well, that's a big deal.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   Had there been a hot war, we wouldn't be having this podcast.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   Los Angeles wouldn't be here. Boston wouldn't be here.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   So a real war, a real bloody war,
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   is catastrophic.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   It could be, and today, absolutely catastrophic.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   So, what I said to David when he invited me to come was,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.000]   "You folks are in the business of strategic imagination."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That's what you do.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That's how you've come to have a degree of confidence in what you do.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You imagine something that seems slightly crazy,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   it seems almost unimaginable.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Somehow you put pieces together.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Some of the time it works, and lo and behold, yikes!
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.500]   Our life has got smartphones, or it has the net,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   or it has AI, or it has vaccines,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   or it has, it has, it has.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   Amazing.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   So I'm hoping that you'll devote some of those gray cells
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   to the geopolitical challenge
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   that China poses to the US today,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   which will be the dominant geopolitical challenge
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.000]   for the rest of our lives.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I don't think there's anything inevitable about the outcome.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.500]   I think, though, if we settle for diplomacy as usual,
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   or statescraft as usual,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   or imagination as usual,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   then we should expect history as usual.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   But that's not, that's the trend.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   That's not inevitable.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   So if you ask me, bottom line, quickly,
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.500]   a war between the US and China in the year ahead,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   a no, I'd give you 99% on that one.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   War between the US and China in the next four years, no,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   I'd say 90%.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   No, okay?
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   War between the US and China over the decades ahead,
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   if both stay on the current paths?
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   I don't like that thinking.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   We have, it seemed like, three decades
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   of incredible collaboration with China
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   and the West, and America specifically.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   And just look at what happened with the iPhone
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.500]   and the number of people who rose out of poverty in China.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   And it seemed to be going really well.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   And it seemed like the NBA was playing games there,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   and we were sending movies there.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   Everything seemed to be on the right track.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   And then something seems to have gone horribly wrong.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   And a two-part question, what has gone horribly wrong?
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500]   Why has this happened so quickly?
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   'Cause it seems like it's changed since COVID
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   in such a rapid fashion that's caught us all by surprise
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   how this has come apart.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   And what does China want that we don't seem to understand?
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   - Okay, two great questions, and I'll try to be brief.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   So maybe in your world, a better way to think of it
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   is to have an established, entrenched company
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500]   and a disruptive upstart.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   - Got it.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   - When the disruptive upstart is 1% of the business,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.500]   welcome, 5% of the business, welcome.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   10% of the business.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   Now it's moving faster and more rapidly.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   All of a sudden, one begins to think, wait a minute,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   where is this going?
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   Could it actually imagine, it will displace me.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   So China was, at the beginning of the century,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   10% of the US GDP.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   Today, it's 3/4 of the US GDP.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.500]   So it's quite plausible that China will have a larger GDP
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   even by market exchange rates than the US.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   Well, wait a minute, we're number one.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   That's part of who we are.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   So in a Thucydidesian dynamic,
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   basically the seesaw of power begins to shift.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   Think of a seesaw on a kid's playground.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   The guy with the bulk is on one end,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   the little guy's on the other, and he begins bulking up.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   All of a sudden, the seesaw begin moving.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   The dynamics of that is Thucydides' trap.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.500]   So the perception changes.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   I used to look down on you,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   now I'm having to look you in the eye, I'm looking up.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   The psychology changes.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   Who the hell do you think you are?
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   I created the environment in which you grew up.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   You should be appreciative.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   -Yeah, we let you make our iPhones.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   -You should take your space.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.500]   Seriously, our normal place is to be running the show,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   and your normal place is to take your seat at the table.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.500]   So many, many people imagined that China
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500]   would just follow the paths of Germany and Japan
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.500]   and take their place in the American-led international order.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.500]   That was a pretty good idea,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.500]   except they hadn't thought very carefully about history.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   Germany and Japan were defeated by the use of the war
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   and occupied by the US,
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   and then we wrote their constitution,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   and then we produced a kind of training school.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.500]   So China wants to be--
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   this is a leak one news slide--
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   China wants to be respected as China,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.500]   not as an honorary member of the West.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   -What happened in the late '90s--
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   I guess it started with Clinton--
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   where it seemed like a good idea to admit to the WTO,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   and then Bush kind of just put the nail in the coffin
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   and did it and actually supported it.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   We could have not supported it.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   Some people say it was a trade-off
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.500]   for China's support for the Iraq war.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   Who knows?
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   But the point is, it happened.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   But I'm sure you guys were sitting in the engine room
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   scenario-planning what happens if this happens.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   And it's fair to say that from that context,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   we didn't necessarily get it right.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   So what did you get wrong?
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   -Again, it's good to go back to 2000,
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   and just to remember, in 2000,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   China was somewhere between 5% and 10% of US's GDP.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.500]   The people in 2000--
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   80% of the people in China were trying to live on $2 a day.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.500]   So the place is a miserable, struggling mess.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.500]   The US has been in the business ever since World War II
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   of trying to encourage economic development in countries.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.500]   So Clinton and Bush together--
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   Clinton said about the WTO,
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.500]   "It's a win-win-win situation.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.500]   It's going to be a win for everybody.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   China's going to be lifted up.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   That's what we would like to do,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   because people's lives will be better."
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   And actually, there's been an anti-poverty miracle in China
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   that as human beings, we have to admire.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   People that used to get a few calories
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   now get enough calories to eat.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   That's got to be a good thing.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.500]   The idea that this might work so successfully
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.500]   that China could become--
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.500]   could have an economy as large as ours
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.500]   didn't occur to anybody at the time.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.500]   A few, few people as outliers.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   But that was just kind of not in the imagination.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   And then secondly, this was in a period of great hubris in the US.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   We had won the Cold War.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   We were living in this bubble,
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   which the most famous thesis of the period
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.500]   was Frank Fukuyama's "End of History."
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.500]   So everybody has become democracies and market economies.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   And if they have McDonald's, they can't have wars
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   because people would prefer to get hamburgers than wars.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   You can hardly say that today without laughing.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.500]   But that was sort of well-known--
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   that was conventional wisdom at the time.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   So if you had come along and said, "Wait a minute.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   "If China's very successful,
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   "it's going to come to have a GDP about the size of the US,
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   "and then it's going to have-- back to your question--
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   "it's going to have its own aspirations."
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.500]   The Chinese have a view, understandably,
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.500]   and Ray talked about this earlier today.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.500]   Sorry, for 4,000 or 5,000 years,
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.500]   they were the predominant power in all the world they knew.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.500]   So their story is the normal conditions of things
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   is that we're at the-- they're Confucian,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   so hierarchy-- harmony and peace comes from hierarchy.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   They're at the top of the hierarchy.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   That's the normal place.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   They were displaced from this by Westerners
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   with technology 150 years ago.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   They call that the "century of humiliation."
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   And their aspiration is to go back to normal.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   And normal for them is China is the "center of the universe."
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   China is the sun around which the others--
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.500]   there's, you know, as you remember their thing about,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.500]   you know, you can't have two tigers in the valley.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   There's the big one and the other one.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   So I have two comments.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   The first is just a reaction to this.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.500]   I'm sort of on the opposite side of you,
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.500]   which is that because of China's population woes
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   and because of, I think, some of these technological things
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   that are sort of on the horizon,
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   I believe that we're sort of at the edge
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   of an era of abundance that will create
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   a massive peace dividend, because a lot of the justifications
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   for war go away.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   That's my personal view.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   But I have taken the time to try to steelman
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.500]   your point of view, which is we go to war.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   And the best steelman that I can come up with
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.500]   is very practical, so I'd like you to try to dismantle it.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   Which is you have massive youth unemployment in China
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   and waning growth, and so the simplest
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.500]   and most reductive way for China to basically grow
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.500]   and to appease 25% of young people,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   mostly men, from not uprising,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.500]   is to essentially create demand.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   And the best way to create demand
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   is to essentially create a war machine.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   And that is why they go to war.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   Is that--
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   - I would say I appreciate that option.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   I've worked very hard on the 12 scenarios
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   for getting to war.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.500]   If there's a war between the US and China
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.500]   in the next year or four years or decade,
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.500]   how is it going to happen in my view?
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.500]   The most likely.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   Not this way.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   It's going to happen the same way the last war happened.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.500]   Now if I were to take a quiz here,
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.500]   since I know we live in the United States of amnesia.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   When was the last war between the US and China?
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   I'm not going to give you a quiz,
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   but I'll tell you the answer is 1950.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   What?
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500]   Okay, and what happened?
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   In 1950, North Korea attacked South Korea.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500]   Almost pushed them off the whole peninsula.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   The US had just won World War II.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   That's five years after the end of World War II.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   MacArthur and American troops were in Japan.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   They came to the rescue of South Korea.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   They pushed the North Koreans right back up the peninsula.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.500]   And 38th parallel, which had been the starting point,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.500]   they pushed right across without even thinking,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   and were pushing right towards the Chinese border, the Yalu.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   So you're now one year, this is 1950,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   one year after Mao has just won the Chinese Civil War.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   He hasn't even consolidated his position.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   The US is Superman.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   We've just dropped two bombs next door in Japan
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   at the end of World War II.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   Monopoly of nuclear power.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   The possibility that China would attack the US,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   it was unimaginable, certainly to MacArthur.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.500]   But Mao, seeing the US coming up to his border
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   and not knowing where else he might stop,
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   sent his peasant army to war with the US
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.500]   and beat the Americans right back down the peninsula
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   to the 38th parallel.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   So wars happen often not because anybody wants a war.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   At the beginning of 1950, if you'd gone to Mao and said,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.500]   "I got a good idea. Why don't you go to a war with Superman?"
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.500]   He would have said, "You're out of your mind."
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   If you'd gone to Truman in 1950 and said,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   "How about we have a war with the US?"
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   "Forget about it."
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.500]   So you don't have to have an intention of either of the parties.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   I think the most likely way a war will happen in the US and China,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500]   something happens in Taiwan,
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   either we're unduly provocative or the Taiwanese provocative.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   - I'm going to hand it to Sax,
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500]   but I want to just make one comment to get your reaction.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.500]   If that's the framing, what about India?
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.500]   Because now India's ascendant, it's got a growing population,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.500]   it's got huge economic growth,
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.500]   and unlike China, who's not necessarily ever been subjugated in a war,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   the Indians have this memory of basically having Judeo-Christians
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.500]   that dominated that region of which we all had to get liberty,
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500]   which is almost even worse maybe.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   So just frame India in that context.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   - Another great question.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.500]   Again, nobody knows, but the Indian story,
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.500]   either theory one,
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.500]   India is about to become a serious rival to China.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   That's the fashionable story today.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   Theory two is India is the country of the future and will always be so.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   We've been through already five of these cycles before
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.500]   where we declared India was about to rise rapidly,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   and lo and behold, India turns out to be India.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.500]   So India has a lot of internal problems itself,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.500]   as was mentioned earlier today.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.500]   About 20% of the population are Muslims.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   Modi is basically undermining the multi-ethnic democracy
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   that Nehru had built
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   by getting support from the majority by oppressing the minority.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   So that's a complicated problem within,
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   and a lot of other components.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.500]   So if you look at the rivalry between the US and India
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500]   in the 20th century and just graph it,
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500]   you discover that lo and behold,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.500]   in every year virtually and every decade for sure,
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   the gap between them has grown in China's favor.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500]   Now, not this year.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   India is growing much faster than China this year and last year
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.500]   and maybe next year, so we can look at the trajectories.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   I think it's quite possible,
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.500]   and I think the American strategy, which I think is the right one,
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   is that this is a long-run game, a long game.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   So there's going to be a long rivalry between the US and China.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.500]   We believe that a more liberty-centered,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   open, democratic political system
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.500]   will perform better over the long run than a party-led autocracy.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   Xi has a different idea.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   He says things are too chaotic, information is too uncertain.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.500]   You can't let people just--
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.500]   My God, let people vote and look and see what happens in the US.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   So we need to have order.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   And so our party-led autocracy, we believe,
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   "Well, we play this out over time."
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.500]   If the US had to play this game, only US versus China, I think we lose.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.500]   But if the US plays this game with a group of allied and aligned,
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   of whom we now see in the quad India and Australia and Japan,
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   and then in AUKUS we see Britain and Australia and the US,
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   and then the trilateral that we just saw with Japan and South Korea.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   So you're seeing a configuration--
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   I call it "more guys on our side of the seesaw."
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   And that can go over a long period of time,
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   and it may turn out that democracies fail internally.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   I think it's a big challenge.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   I think there's no certainty about that.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.500]   It may turn out that autocracies fail
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.500]   in the way autocracies have historically failed.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   -It is an incredible framing because you have an autocracy in China
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   and a democracy here, and then somewhat democratic
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   is how we're, I think, describing India right now.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.500]   Is India the most important relationship for America to get right
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.500]   at this moment in time?
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.500]   Is that the relationship we really need to be focusing on
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.500]   since that seems like it's the linchpin or the fulcrum?
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.500]   -Well, I would say that's a good question, and I'm not sure.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   I am probably unduly skeptical about India
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   because my impressions are overly shaped by Lee Kuan Yew.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   Lee Kuan Yew was the founder and builder of Singapore,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   and his great hope was for India,
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.500]   but ultimately he became to be despairing of its internal complexities.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.500]   Modi seems to be a different character.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.500]   If you look at the way he ran the province that he ran before,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.500]   the state, he was very effective.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.500]   He's very ambitious for India, so I'm hopeful about India.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   If India emerges, it has the potential alongside,
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   I don't think only India, Japan, South Korea, Australia,
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.500]   and even maybe the Europeans, again, depending on what happens here.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   So you could have a group of aligned and aligned,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.500]   not all agreeing on everything, but agreeing on enough,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:48.500]   that says we're trying the complex problem of governing a society,
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   we believe has to start with the freedom and liberty of people.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500]   That's what we think is--
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   and we think that's essential for the dynamism of innovation and invention,
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.500]   and lo and behold, there's a lot of evidence for that,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   and if we're the freest and most open society,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.500]   lo and behold, a bunch of people come from other countries
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   where they're not so free, and they do their thing here.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   I'd say thank God for that.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:18.500]   So under those circumstances, played out over a long run,
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   you can imagine a story that turns out pretty well.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.500]   In the case of the US and Soviet Union, just to remember,
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.500]   it's hard to believe, but if you go back and read your economic textbook
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   that was published in the 1960s,
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   Samuelson was the--basically for economics,
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.500]   it says by the '70s, the Soviet Union will have overtaken the US economy.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.500]   That was kind of a well-known fact.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.500]   -Why didn't that happen? -Well, lo and behold, it didn't.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.500]   The reason it didn't happen is because dictatorships have a hard time
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   in the long term versus democracies?
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   Well, there's about ten reasons why there's weaknesses in an autocracy,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   and you're now seeing a lot of evidence of it in the Chinese system,
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   particularly after Xi became even more autocratic
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.500]   in guaranteeing his lease on life with the recent coronation,
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.500]   where he's got his third term unprecedented but without a term limit.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   So basically, if I'm the autocrat, and especially if I come to think,
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   as he does, he's got the thought of Xi Jinping,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   they write this into the Constitution, so this contains all wisdom.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.500]   One of the problems the guys are having with their AI machines
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.500]   is you can't ask a question that has an answer inconsistent
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.500]   with the thought of Xi Jinping that declares what's true about this and that.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   He doesn't talk much about mathematics or science,
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.500]   so you can ask those questions.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   Tencent's AI machine is a pretty good competitor for GPT-4
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   in the science or math, but if you ask a question about
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.500]   how do freedom-centered societies perform,
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   it can't answer that question because the thought of Xi Jinping says this.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   -He says this. -Does not compute.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:11.500]   Another one, if you choose people for loyalty more than for competence,
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   look at a company and see how that works.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   So seven reasons, yes.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   One of the points you make in your book is that--
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.500]   and I think your book came out around the time that China and the US
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   had achieved rough parity in terms of purchasing power parity, their GDP.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   -Roughly, yeah. -Roughly.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   I remember one of the points you made is that China has four times
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:42.500]   the population of the US, so its per capita GDP was one quarter that of the US.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   If they merely got to the point of having half the per capita GDP of the US,
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.500]   then their economy would be twice as big as ours.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   China has a lot of really smart, hardworking people who are studying subjects
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.500]   that we aren't studying as much as we should in the US,
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.500]   like engineering, like science, and so forth.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.500]   There are reasons, I think, to believe that their incredible rise could derail.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:11.500]   The demographics are a problem, maybe if the economy becomes too centrally controlled.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.500]   But let's just assume that it does continue its rise.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   I guess the question would be, will the US have to effectively recognize
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.500]   that they have a sphere of influence in Asia in order to avoid a war?
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.500]   I mean, is that what we're going to have to do?
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   I think, so I appreciate you're starting with the basics.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   Structural realities are harder to deny.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   So again, Americans don't like this, but just do the arithmetic.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   If Chinese are only, if their economy is only half as productive as ours,
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   and these are pretty talented people and they work pretty hard,
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   they'll have a GDP twice ours.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   I'll do it again. Wait a minute, twice ours.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.500]   I'll tell you in a rivalry between A and B, and B has twice the GDP.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.500]   So we can have twice the size of the defense budget.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   We can have twice the intelligence budget.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   It can have twice, twice, twice.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   That's reality.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:18.500]   Now, can I find enough allied and aligned on my side to make up for some of that?
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.500]   Yeah, that seems right.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500]   So that's one way.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.500]   We need an alliance strategy more than they do.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   That's right. We need it.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   But if you said over time in relationships like that,
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   if you're going to avoid war, will there – I mean, a sphere of influence –
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   again, there's a great abstract debate about this,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:47.500]   but in reality the sphere of influence is the shadow that power casts in some realm.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   So if you're more powerful, you have a sphere of influence.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.500]   So in the South China Sea today, on the Chinese border, they have more ships,
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.500]   they have more missiles on the land.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.500]   So lo and behold, we don't call that their sphere of influence,
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.500]   but if you look and see what happens in the area,
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   we don't operate our ships the way we did when I was in the Pentagon in the Clinton administration.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   So if there were an event in Taiwan, which is 90 miles off their shore,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   like Cuba is on our shore, and halfway around the world for us,
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.500]   the likelihood we're going to have the ships and the planes and the other –
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   excuse me, no, that just doesn't work that way.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   You can look at the geography and see the tyranny of it.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   So will there come to be some degree of difference and accommodation
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   if a war is to be avoided?
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.500]   And the answer is yes.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.500]   Now then it becomes ugly because you say, well, okay, well, in what respect?
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:53.500]   And I know you guys – I saw earlier did the question for Robert Kennedy about Taiwan.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.500]   I think that's a good question not to answer, not to answer.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.500]   [Applause]
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   Yeah, I mean, this is where I worry about the competence of our foreign policy establishment
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   because I think it only has one gear, which is forward and double down.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   In the United States, we have a doctrine, the Monroe Doctrine,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.500]   which says that no distant great power can bring troops, weapons, or bases into our hemisphere
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   because we do not tolerate other great powers having security threats amassed on our border.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   But our foreign policy establishment cannot comprehend that other great powers
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.500]   want a similar Monroe Doctrine.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   I think that was a huge contributor to the war we have in Ukraine right now.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   [Applause]
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   So we have this theory.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   I mean, I'm part of this establishment that you're talking about.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.500]   [Laughter]
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.500]   So why did you invade Ukraine?
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   [Laughter]
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500]   It's not as –
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   That's such a gross implication.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   It's not as uniform as you say, and it's not always as unsuccessful as you say.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.500]   But overall, I think you're more right than wrong.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   So basically, we say we're the exceptional nation.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.500]   So what does that mean?
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   We make the rules, and you're supposed to obey the rules.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.500]   But we don't obey the rules.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.500]   So we say we're for the rule-based order.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:24.500]   Excuse me, the rule-based order was the basis on which we invaded Iraq?
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.500]   I don't think so.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   That we occupied Afghanistan?
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   I don't think so.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   So the U.S. has made a lot of mistakes of unnecessary wars.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:41.500]   [Applause]
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   A lot of the unnecessary wars was because people with wrong ideas dominated people with right ideas.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500]   But there was a debate and a discussion.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.500]   So we need more people with the right ideas getting into the conversation in an active way.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   But let me just do one other footnote here.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.500]   [Applause]
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   We have to remember, this is 9/11.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   So this is a big day for me.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:14.500]   This is a day in which airplanes hijacked by terrorists killed 3,000 people at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   including many people that I know extremely well.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   What would a world be like in which that happened every day or every week or every month?
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500]   We'd be totally intolerable.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   We wouldn't be doing what we're doing.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   Why is that not happening?
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.500]   So people did some right things.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:37.500]   So there's been a pretty active program by the U.S., some of it with mistakes, but overall,
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   that's played a significant role in the fact that people who plan and train to conduct major terrorist attacks
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   in the U.S. are taken off the chessboard.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   Every day people go out hunting.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.500]   Every day people find people.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500]   And I would say thank goodness for this.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   [Applause]
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.500]   So I think that's an interesting point.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.500]   Certainly al-Qaeda hasn't been able to hit us again in that way.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.500]   I do wonder whether there were two tragedies on 9/11.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.500]   One was the thousands of people who died.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   The other was the way that we reacted to it.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   Like you said, we went into Iraq, a total non sequitur.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   Stupid, yes.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.500]   Stupid and a non sequitur, and then we stayed in Afghanistan for 20 years.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   And again, not in Assyria.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.500]   Yeah, on sort of the nation-building grounds.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   We then went into Syria.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.500]   That's still going on.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.500]   There was Libya.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.500]   And there was very little debate about all of these things at the time we made these decisions.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:36.500]   It's almost like the U.S. foreign policy establishment, in reaction to 9/11, became almost deranged.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   And, you know, compared to say the 1990s where I think there were real foreign policy debates,
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.500]   there was a real foreign policy debate in the '90s on NATO expansion,
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   it doesn't seem like we have that many debates.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.500]   Not within the policy elite.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   Maybe we're having them.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   But it doesn't seem like the policy elite debates anything anymore.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   It's just this sort of bellicose, hawkish rhetoric at all times.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   Do you agree with that, Graham?
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   From both sides.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   From the inside.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.500]   Yeah, I mean, again, I live on the other side.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.500]   I live on both sides of this curtain.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.500]   And I would say inside, there's much more debate, and there was much more debate,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   than we take credit for.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   George Bush made a terrible, terrible, terrible mistake in invading Iraq in 2003.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.500]   Who said that to him?
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:30.500]   His father's closest advisor, Brent Scowcroft, who was joined at the hip with the father,
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   said to him, "This is a terrible, dumb mistake."
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   He even went so far as to write an op-ed about it after he had--
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.500]   Now, he did not write an op-ed without talking to Bush's father.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   Would George H.W. Bush have done this?
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   No.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   If Gore-- If the count had gone right in Florida and Gore had been president,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   would we have gone into Iraq?
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.500]   No.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   So, electing the right president and having the right--
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   So, if it had been the Bush 41 team, rather than the Bush 43 team,
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   we wouldn't have made that mistake.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   So, how would you--
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   You mentioned this RFK clip.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.500]   One of the things that he says is that we've gotten things backwards now,
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.500]   where there's a military-industrial complex that essentially wants to maximize revenue.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   That's like logical in the capitalist system.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   But then what it's done is it's perverted the intelligence-gathering institutions
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:28.500]   to essentially be writing the justifications for these wars before these wars happen.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:33.500]   Is that conspiracy theory or is that--
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   I'd say it's complicated, so--
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.500]   But it's not a no.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.500]   I think it's true.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   It's not a no is what you're saying.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   No, it's--
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   Why is it complicated?
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:49.500]   We live in an extremely dangerous world.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   But do we, though?
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   This year--
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   But, Grant, can I ask you, do we really, though?
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   Absolutely.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   Really?
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   Had thousands of people not been taken off the chessboard,
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.500]   you would have seen many repeats of 9/11.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   And if you were living in a place--
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   and somebody I know was trying to make a last trade on the morning of 9/11,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   and a plane crashes in and the building is knocked down,
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   all of a sudden the conversation changes.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.500]   So there's that.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   I don't want to take the gravity away from it.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   That's the terrorist piece.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.500]   Let's take war.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   This is the other big event most people don't realize.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.500]   This month is the anniversary of the end of World War II
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   and the beginning of 78 years in which there's not been another great power war.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   Excuse me.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   In history, that's almost unheard of.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   Why is that?
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.500]   Answer, a lot of good fortune, a lot of grace.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.500]   But also lots of things that the U.S. did successfully.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   So I think that security dominates everything when you don't have security.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   And the geopolitics to provide security is very complicated.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.500]   Now, the structures that do that often end up making big mistakes too.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   So I'm not trying to make excuses for the mistakes,
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   but I think the overall of it is that the security order that's been built in the past
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   and survived for the last 70 years has been a big deal.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   I agree with you.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   I want to ask, what you said there, which is through the framing Chamath has here,
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   we have this military industrial complex,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   we have this complicated relationship with China, and then we have Taiwan.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   And we have this incredible policy of ambiguity,
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   and it seemed to be working really well.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   And now are we having the proper debate on Taiwan?
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   The debate we should be having on defending Taiwan, not defending Taiwan,
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   providing them with arms?
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   Because you seem to believe in the book that this is going to be what it's about.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.500]   Let me add to that question, and this is going to be our last question
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   because we do need to move on.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.500]   In your role in defense planning,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   and you look at the Department of Defense today
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   and the U.S. defense industrial complex, are we equipped for a hot conflict with China?
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   And if we're not, does that change the positioning and the strategy that China then has
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   and how they think about what they're going to do next with the U.S.?
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   So the first one is no, we're not, and it certainly impacts China.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   In fact, I think if you were able to green field the Defense Department today for half the money,
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   you could get twice the bang for the buck.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   So bureaucracies are complicated, difficult.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:31.500]   The fact that we haven't had another great power war, I'm prepared to pay a little extra for,
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   but if you said how efficient is it, not so much.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   And I think the big question we should ask ourselves is for rational actors in Washington
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   or here today us and in Beijing, are there more reasons, more incentives,
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   to compete between the U.S. and China or alternatively more incentives to cooperate?
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   So we've been to all the ones to compete, but for cooperating,
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   excuse me, if we have a war, we destroy ourselves.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   So we have a pretty powerful interest in survival in not having a war
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   and not allowing something happen in Taiwan or this or that.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.500]   If we live in an enclosed biosphere on a small planet,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   either party's greenhouse gas emission can make the place unlivable for both of us.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   If we don't find a way to cooperate in dealing with that.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.500]   We have a financial system that's so entangled that a financial crisis in one place
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.500]   can become a depression everywhere.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.500]   So if we don't find a way to do it.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   So I would say it's a good assignment for everybody.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   Make your list of the reasons, incentives to compete and turn the sheet over,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   incentives to cooperate.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   We need a lot more strategic imagination in that space,
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   and I'm hoping some of you guys and other folks will put some of their gray cells onto that problem.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.500]   Instead of this de facto posturing that everyone seems to hold today
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.500]   that we're going to go to war, this is our enemy,
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   and just be a little more thoughtful about the long-term relationship.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   Graham Allison, thank you so much.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   Amazing.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   That was absolutely fantastic.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   Thank you.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   Wow.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.500]   Another standing ovation.
