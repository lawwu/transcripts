[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - Anne from Hattiesburg, Mississippi writes in
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.800]   to ask this, "Pastor John, if Jesus is infinitely satisfied
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.380]   "in the fellowship of the Trinity with perfect joy,
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.260]   "in what sense did he endure the cross
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080]   "for the joy set before him?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.720]   "How could his joy be increased
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.820]   "if he was perfectly satisfied already?"
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.640]   - I don't know if Anne realizes
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.680]   what a massive question she's asking.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.920]   (laughs)
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.000]   I mean, there are philosophical names
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   for this kind of question that she wouldn't even recognize.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.920]   It is an excellent question.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.360]   It's not quirky, it's not new, it's part of a bigger issue.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.000]   For example, if God was perfectly happy
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   in the fellowship of the Trinity from all eternity,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.500]   what motive would there have been to create the world?
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.320]   That's one of the ways this question is asked.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.400]   Was there joy in creating the world?
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.400]   If so, was God deficient before he actualized that joy
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.100]   in creating the world?
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.100]   Or if God can get angry at Israel, which he does,
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.720]   and threatens to wipe her out,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   and Moses intervenes and God relents,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.700]   was his joy in Israel constant through that?
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.920]   Or did it go up and down?
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.340]   And if his joy goes up and down,
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.440]   how can we talk about him being consistently and perfectly
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.860]   and all satisfyingly happy?
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.960]   Or what does it mean in Psalm 115, verse three,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.760]   "Our God is in the heavens, he does all that he pleases."
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.400]   Or Isaiah 46, nine and 10, "I am God, there is no other,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   "I am God and there is none like me,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.000]   "saying my counsel will stand,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.080]   "I will accomplish all my good pleasure."
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.960]   The same word that was used up there in Psalm 115, three,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.160]   he does all that he pleases,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.580]   he accomplishes all his good pleasure.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.580]   Well, if he does, in what sense can he be displeased?
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.740]   And the Bible clearly says we can displease him.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.620]   Ephesians 5, 10 says,
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.540]   "Try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord,
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.920]   "as though you sometimes do and you sometimes don't."
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.160]   And that's right, we don't always please the Lord,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.720]   therefore the Lord is sometimes displeased with us.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.720]   So Anne, you have asked a huge, huge problem.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:41.160]   And her problem, of course, was, it says in Hebrews 12, two,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.040]   "For the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross."
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   So as if, well, it's not fully there
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.400]   in his Gethsemane experience,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.160]   he's just got it out in front of him,
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880]   and so how can he, as a member of the Trinity,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   be fully and completely satisfied?
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.420]   So there's the question, now here comes Piper's,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.400]   (laughs)
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.440]   Piper's little puny effort to try to respond to this,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.880]   and I've thought a lot about it,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.960]   so I have some thoughts,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.320]   and I'll throw them out for people to ponder.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   Number one, God does not experience emotions,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.980]   positive or negative, the way we do.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.000]   We have very little control over how we feel.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.880]   Things happen to us, and they have an effect on us.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.720]   They sneak up on us, or we don't want them to happen,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.600]   and they happen, and they make us feel a way,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.320]   and we wouldn't have chosen to feel that way,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   but we feel that way because it happened to us.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.960]   God's not like that.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.000]   Nothing sneaks up on God.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.880]   Nothing overtakes God that he doesn't see coming,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.700]   and permit to come or not permit to come,
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.280]   and therefore plan to respond to or not to respond to.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.120]   Nothing is whimsical about God.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   He's not under the control of any of his emotions.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.280]   They are all planned.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.540]   God is never the victim of emotion.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.680]   They're all part of his totally unified, integrated,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.960]   complete perfection, rising and falling
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.760]   precisely the way he plans and wills.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   So whatever variation there appear to be in God,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.240]   it's part of a much larger constancy and unity
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.720]   and coherence and stability.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.320]   That's the first thing to say.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   God's emotional life is not the same as our emotional life.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.540]   It's not the same as ours.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.620]   Number two, part of the issue with regard to Hebrews 12, two,
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.840]   the joy set before him is owing to the mystery
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.140]   of Christ's two natures.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.820]   He is human and divine at once.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.980]   His divine nature and his human nature
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.580]   do not have identical subjective responses
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.780]   to what Jesus goes through.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.160]   Therefore, whatever his divine nature experienced,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.400]   and I don't know how to fully describe or discern that,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.640]   whatever his divine nature experienced,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.160]   we are surely supposed to think of Jesus' human nature
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.560]   during his last hours as extremely oppressed
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.040]   and weighed down and sorrowful and in great agony
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.320]   at certain times of that night and the next morning.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.360]   And yet he was sustained by the hope
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.360]   of the total success of his mission, the joy set before him.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.100]   He could taste that, and he could taste it enough
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.720]   of this joy to carry him through.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.800]   I think that's the meaning of that text.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.720]   It doesn't mean that his divine nature
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.140]   was any less in communion and fellowship
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.200]   with the Father and the Spirit as he always had been,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.360]   but these things are very difficult to conceive,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.040]   and we just need to stir in the fact
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.080]   that the two natures always have to be in front of us
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.200]   when we ponder how to describe the experiences
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.440]   of Christ on earth.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.960]   Here's the last thing to say,
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.160]   and probably the most important,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160]   at least from my effort to manage my own emotional response
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.900]   to these things in God.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.280]   The two natures of Christ are not the solution
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.080]   to the larger issue of the joy God had in creation
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.680]   and the pleasure he has in the obedience
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.760]   of his children and so on.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.720]   These are real joys that vary in God.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.880]   So what sense does it have to speak of his joy
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.760]   in the fellowship of the Trinity being full and perfect
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.480]   if there can be displeasures of God with our behavior
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.080]   or with Israel or joy in the repentance of one sinner
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   who repents more joy in heaven than 99 righteous person?
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.180]   And here are my two responses to that.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.400]   God can look at any event through two lenses,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.420]   a narrow lens that focuses on the thing itself
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.480]   without reference to the totality of things,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.100]   and the broad lens, the wide lens,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.680]   that sees the thing in relation to the entirety
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.980]   of all that he does.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.760]   So when he looks at an evil, like my sin,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.480]   I'm his child, I sin, and he's displeased with that.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.720]   When he looks at my sin or just some evil in the world,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.140]   through the narrow lens, he sees it as ugly,
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.840]   and it displeases him in its ugliness.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.540]   But when he sees it through the wide lens,
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.940]   he sees it in relation to all things,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.340]   like a thread, a dark thread or tattered thread
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.220]   in a bright tapestry that in relation to the whole
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.060]   performs its perfect role,
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.960]   though the thread itself may be imperfect.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.540]   And he rejoices.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.900]   He rejoices when he sees through the wide lens like that
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.900]   over how my sin fits into the big picture.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.920]   And the mystery is that God looks through these lenses
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.800]   simultaneously.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.920]   And what appears to us as variableness in God
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.160]   as he is pleased or displeased is really part
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.560]   of the complexity of his glorious, unified, constant,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.140]   stable, pure, coherent mind.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   That's the first thing to say.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.340]   Second thing, these are two pictures.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.980]   So the picture of the lenses,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.740]   and here's a second picture of a fountain.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.980]   And I get this from Jonathan Edwards.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.900]   When we say that God found joy in creating
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.340]   or redeeming the world,
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   do we mean that this joy made up for a deficiency in God
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.940]   that wasn't there?
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.960]   I mean, the joy wasn't there, so he had a deficiency.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.960]   First there was a deficiency and then he created,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.760]   and now he has joy and the deficiency is compensated for.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.160]   And the answer to that is no, no, no, no.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.660]   That's not the way to think about this.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.660]   Edwards says, "It is no sign of the deficiency of a fountain
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.840]   "that it is prone to overflow."
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   So it seems to me we want to retain two biblical truths.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.820]   God experiences joy in doing things,
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.460]   and God's joy was full before he did them.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.460]   And the way I would say this is the joy God experiences
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.500]   in doing things does not make up for any deficiency of joy,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.940]   but rather expresses a fullness of joy.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.260]   God's joys in relation to creation
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.440]   are not additions, but overflow.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.760]   So Tony, these are weighty, weighty matters,
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.560]   and that's my best effort to tackle this question.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.760]   - Wow, yes, those are weighty matters.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.000]   Thank you as always for tackling it, Pastor John.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.620]   And as a follow-up,
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.240]   I commend an Ask Pastor John podcast episode we recorded,
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.580]   which is titled, "If God is so happy,
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.780]   "why does he seem so angry?"
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.180]   That's episode number 133, check that out.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.680]   And tomorrow we return to talk about a very,
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   very painful chapter from Pastor John's ministry in church
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.040]   and what he learned from the painful experience.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.980]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:06.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
