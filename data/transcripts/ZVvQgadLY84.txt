[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Here's an interestingly put question
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.920]   from a podcast listener who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.720]   Pastor John, how does our delight in God
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.200]   fuel or provide a stable foundation
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.640]   for our delight in the good gifts of creation?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.860]   - I was surprised by this question.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.800]   I will try to say something about it
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.840]   with the help of C.S. Lewis in just a minute,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320]   but I was surprised because usually the question
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.440]   goes the other way around.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.560]   How can our delight in creation fuel our delight in God
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.600]   so that it doesn't become idolatry?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660]   I mean, that seems to be the kind of concern
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.640]   that a lot of people have is I love stuff so much.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.740]   I love pizza and I love friendship and I love nature.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.900]   How can that feed my delight in God without becoming,
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.000]   but that's not the question here.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.360]   So I had to kind of redo my brain and say,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.920]   okay, this is good.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.160]   I don't usually ask this kind of question.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.240]   It is interesting.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.560]   The question is how does our delight in God
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   fuel or provide a stable foundation
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.240]   for our delight in creation?
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.920]   So I'll try to take the question seriously as it stands.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.700]   Here's the main thing.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.240]   Believing in God and delighting in God for himself
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.240]   is the only way to protect nature,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.340]   all the good things God has made, from being God.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.600]   Without belief in God and delight in God
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.080]   as our supreme treasure,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.000]   we have to treat nature as self-existent.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.400]   If there's no God, nature is self-existent,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.360]   big bang or whatever you want to call it.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   And we are all wired to worship what is self-existent,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.800]   especially if it is as glorious as the universe.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   But the moment we turn nature into a God, we lose it.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   We lose nature for what it really is.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.800]   It was not made to be worshiped.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.160]   Nature will lure us, then cheat us,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.360]   if we try to make her absolute.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   She's a creature and all her true, amazing,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.740]   scintillating, stunning glory
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.060]   is the glory of a God-designed creature.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.940]   Now, no one has said this better, as far as I know,
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.720]   than C.S. Lewis.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.580]   So let me read, last thing I'm gonna do,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.840]   just read a section from his book, "The Miracles."
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm quoting it from my book.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.860]   This is the most recent book I wrote,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.640]   "Seeing Beauty and Saying Beautifully."
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.480]   And I'm quoting it because I leave out some things
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.240]   and it helps collapse it down.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.200]   And I'm reading from page 139 in that book
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.000]   where I was blown away by what Lewis says.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.200]   So here's a chunk of one of the greatest writers
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.040]   and apologists in the 20th century, C.S. Lewis.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.440]   He says this.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   "The Englishness of English is audible
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.520]   only to those who know some other language as well.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   In the same way, and for the same reason,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520]   only super naturalists really see nature.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.060]   You must go a little way from her
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.960]   and then turn around and look back.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.880]   And then at last, the true landscape will become visible.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.200]   You must have tasted, however briefly,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   the pure water from beyond the world
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.120]   before you can be distinctly conscious
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.120]   of the hot, salty tang of nature's current.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.200]   To treat her as God or as everything
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.280]   is to lose the whole pith and pleasure of her.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.440]   Come out, look back, then you will see
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   this astonishing cataract of bears, babies, bananas,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480]   this immoderate deluge of atoms, orchids,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.360]   and oranges, and cancers, canaries, fleas,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.880]   gases, tornadoes, and toads.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.680]   How could you have ever thought this was ultimate reality?
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.320]   How could you ever have thought that it was merely
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.680]   a stage set for the moral drama of men and women?
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.840]   She is herself.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.200]   Offer her neither worship nor contempt.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.520]   Meet her and know her.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.880]   The theologians tell us that she,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.720]   like ourselves, is to be redeemed.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.460]   The vanity to which she was subjected
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.140]   was her disease, not her essence.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.680]   She will be cured, but cured in character,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.520]   not tamed, heaven forbid, not sterilized.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   We shall still be able to recognize our old enemy,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.880]   friend, playfellow, foster mother,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.880]   so perfected as to be not less, but more herself,
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.800]   and that will be a merry meeting.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.640]   (laughs)
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   I just love Lewis, don't you?
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.300]   - Oh, my yes.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.400]   - Nobody writes like Lewis.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   So, in other words, the full God-intended beauty
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.280]   and wonder and delight that we are to have in creation
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.060]   is possible only for those who don't make a God
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.360]   out of creation, but have a superior delight
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   in the maker of creation.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Unless creation mediates to us God's wonder
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.840]   through its wonder, we have not yet tasted
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.560]   its true and full wonder.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.760]   That's the pleasure only those can have
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.160]   who know and delight in God through Christ
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.200]   above all things.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.680]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.160]   And again, that beautiful Lewis quote
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.680]   can be found in Pastor John's new book,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.640]   "Seeing Beauty and Saying Beautifully,"
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.780]   a wonderful book in its own right,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.680]   if I can say that.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.120]   Well, there, I just said it.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.960]   It's one of my favorite books of 2014,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.940]   and you can download the entire book right now
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.680]   free of charge from our website, DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.280]   Go there, click on the Books tab at the top of the page
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.640]   and look for the title, "Seeing Beauty
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.120]   and Saying Beautifully."
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.080]   But don't thank me.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.920]   We make our books available online for free
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   because we have some incredible financial donors
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.560]   supporting this ministry.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.520]   Well, it's not easy to get Pastor John
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.040]   to talk about the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.560]   Tomorrow, I'll do my best to change that.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.080]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
