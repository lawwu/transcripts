[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   Being a human being is not easy, as opposed to an animal, because we're born and nobody
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.260]   gives us a direction.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.080]   Our parents might be a little bit, our college teachers, etc., mentors, but generally we're
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080]   on our own.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.680]   And it's a very, very difficult process.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.080]   You wake up in the morning and you don't really know what you can do.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.300]   You can choose 12 different paths, it can be very confusing and very overwhelming.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.760]   When you find that sense of purpose, when you find what I call your life's task, everything
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.300]   has a direction, everything has a purpose, your energy is concentrated.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.860]   It's not like you're just going down a single narrow pathway.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.260]   It's not like life becomes boring and it's just about discipline and solving problems.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.800]   It's actually the most exciting thing that can ever happen to you, because you never
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.380]   have that lost feeling.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.800]   You wake up in the morning and you go, yeah, this is what I need to accomplish.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.760]   People come at you with all kinds of distractions and boring and irritating things.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.280]   You're able to cut it out.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120]   It's just the most marvelous piece of internal radar that you can have.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.600]   So I genuinely wish that everybody can find that kind of internal radar.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.760]   And so it's not easy.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.040]   And I understand that there's no like instant formula, because we're all about instant formulas.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040]   It's difficult.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   And I want you to know that.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040]   So it's not like Robert can give me the answer in three minutes.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.300]   No, I can't.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.240]   But there's a process involved.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.880]   It's not, it's not, you know, a mystery.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960]   You can follow a very singular process.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.760]   And the idea is you're talking about childhood.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.160]   The way I like to frame it is when you were born, you are a phenomenon, you are unique.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.240]   Your DNA has never occurred in the history of the universe.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.680]   Going back billions of years, it will never occur in the future.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.140]   Your life experience with your parents and everything that you experienced in your early
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.260]   years going on up is unique.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.260]   It's yours.
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.920]   You're one of a kind, right?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.220]   So that is your source of power.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.780]   To waste that is just the worst thing you can do in your life.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.780]   And what the power is, is finding that uniqueness.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.460]   What makes you you and how you can mine that and how you can go deep into it and use that
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.060]   to create a career path, right?
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.740]   And so I tell people when you're a child, when you're four or five or even younger,
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.500]   you have what the great psychologist Maslow called impulse voices.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.560]   They're little voices in your head that say, I love this.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   I hate that.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.660]   I like this food.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660]   I don't like when mommy moves this way.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.020]   I like when daddy comes from here.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.660]   You're very cued into who you are and what you like and what you don't like.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.260]   And these voices kind of direct you in certain ways, right?
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.020]   And when you're very young, they direct you towards intellectual mental pursuits as well.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.580]   And there's a book I recommend for everybody.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.740]   It's Howard Gardner's Five Frames of Mind.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.700]   It's helped me immensely.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.420]   The idea is he talks about five forms of intelligence.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.220]   Our problem is we think of intelligence as mostly intellectual, but there are many forms
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.640]   of intelligence.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.780]   There's the intelligence that has to do with words.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.740]   There's abstract intelligence that has to do with patterns and mathematics.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.580]   There's kinetic intelligence that has to do with the body.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.100]   There's social intelligence.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.700]   He has five of them.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.580]   And the idea is your brain naturally veers towards one of them.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.820]   It can veer towards two of them.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.820]   That happens.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.060]   But generally, one of them kind of dominates, right?
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.500]   And it's like a grain in your brain that's going in a certain direction.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.820]   You want to go with that grain because that's where your power will lie.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.420]   So when you're young, if you go back and think about when you were four or five, you can
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.340]   maybe get a picture of some kind of direction or voice inside of you that was impelling
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.540]   you towards this.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.640]   I know for me, it was words.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   I can remember when I was six years old, I was just obsessed with words, just the letters
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.380]   in words, almost like in this almost slightly schizophrenic way.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.840]   I would spell words backwards.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   I would take them apart.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   I would do anagrams.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.220]   I love palindromes, right?
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.420]   So I had a thing about words and language.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.880]   It's very primal.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.340]   Some people, you know, Albert Einstein, when he was four years old, his father gave him
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.100]   a birthday gift of a compass.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.660]   And he was just mesmerized by this compass.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.900]   The idea that there are invisible forces out there in the cosmos moving this needle.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.060]   And he's obsessed with the idea of invisible forces.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.740]   Steve Jobs, when he was like seven or eight or maybe younger in Burlingame, California,
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.120]   his father, they passed by a store with technological devices in the window.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.500]   And he was just hypnotized by the design of those devices and the glass tubes and everything.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.020]   So he wanted to go in that direction.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.460]   You know, Tiger Woods saw his father hitting golf balls in the garage, and he was just
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.700]   like screaming with joy.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.040]   He had to do that, right?
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.980]   You know, I could give you a million different examples of this.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.860]   Of course, these are people who are famous, obviously.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.900]   We can go back and find that.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.180]   It's easier.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.700]   But what happens to you-- and please cut me off if I'm going on too long.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   No, please continue.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.700]   Please.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.700]   What happens to you is you're seven, now you're getting older, and you're starting to not
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.460]   hear that voice anymore.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.260]   You're hearing the voice of your teachers telling you, you're not good at this field.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.100]   You need to get better at math.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.900]   You know, you shouldn't be interested in these sports or anything.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.180]   You should be going this way.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.020]   Your parents are starting to tell you, this is the career they want for you or the direction
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.300]   they want you to go in, right?
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.540]   You start hearing that more than your own voice.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.420]   And as you get older, it gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.700]   Then when you're a teenager, it's all about what other people are doing-- your peers,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.940]   what's cool, what's not cool, you know?
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.220]   And that kind of is more-- so all of this noise enters your brain.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.460]   And you can't hear that anymore.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.220]   You don't know who you are.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.940]   And so you go to college.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.980]   You kind of maybe choose a major that seems practical that your parents want you to go
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.980]   into.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.820]   Maybe you kind of wander around.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.940]   You're not sure.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.740]   And then you enter the work world without that inner radar that I'm talking about.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.980]   And brother, you're lost, right?
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.980]   Where should I go?
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.920]   Well, I need to make money, right?
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.820]   And so you make a choice based on the need to make a lot of money.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.340]   Not everyone, but some people do that.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.460]   And I understand that need.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.260]   We all need to make a living.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.780]   But that can set you off on a very bad path because you're not connected emotionally.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.980]   The thing is when you figure out that primal inclination, that grain that's inside of you,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:48.460]   then you have the energy to be disciplined, to go through boring tasks, to learn.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.080]   You learn at a faster rate because you're emotionally engaged.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.140]   When you're emotionally engaged in a subject, the brain learns twice, three times, four
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.620]   times as fast as when you're not.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.380]   I always give the example in college, I studied foreign languages, which was kind of a passion
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.800]   of mine.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.980]   For three or four years, I studied French.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.860]   And then I went to Paris and I couldn't speak a word.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.860]   It was useless because it didn't teach me anything practical, right?
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.000]   I was totally confused.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.540]   And then, but I was in Paris and I loved it and I wanted to live there, right?
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.620]   And I had a girlfriend and I needed to speak French to her.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.860]   And I can tell you in one month, I learned more than those four years of university because
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.700]   I wanted to, because I was engaged, my emotions were there.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.780]   It was like I had to survive to learn French.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.060]   So most of us, we don't have a need really to learn this subject.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.900]   We're paying half attention.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.460]   But when you find that thing that really connects to you, you're paying deep attention.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.080]   Your emotions are engaged.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.260]   You're learning at a much faster rate, okay?
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.220]   And so the thing is, how do you find that when you're older?
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.940]   When you're 21, I give people a lot of help and it's usually not so difficult.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.820]   We can go through that process.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.280]   It gets harder when you're 30 and you've been wandering around, but it's not impossible.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:16.360]   I didn't really start find my exact path until I was 38, 39, to be honest.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.640]   So there's hope.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.100]   When you get 40 and you get 50, it gets more and more difficult, right?
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.080]   And it's very sad if you wasted that seed of uniqueness that I'm talking about.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.920]   And I tell people there are ways of going back and we go through a process like archeology.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.680]   We have to dig and dig and dig and find those bones from your childhood that indicated what
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.460]   you were meant to do.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.680]   But when you find your life's task, everything opens up.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.080]   It doesn't mean you figured out, okay, I've got to aim for this particular job when I'm
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   28.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.160]   That's not how it works.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.040]   It gives you a sense of direction.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.520]   You can try different things.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   You can experiment.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.440]   You can have fun when you're in your 20s.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   You're going to learn.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.500]   You're going to learn skills.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.160]   But it gives you an overall framework instead of, oh, all this confusion, this chaos, social
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160]   media, the internet.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.660]   I could go here, here, here.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.040]   You're lost at sea.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.380]   It gives you a very important sense of direction, a compass.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:14.780]   As you describe this, I have this image of, you mentioned animals that presumably don't
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.780]   have a lot of flexibility in terms of the niches they can exist in.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:24.160]   But the way I imagine this process is that as a human, we're plopped into a environment.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.220]   And here I'm using an analogy where we don't really know if we are an aquatic animal, a
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:36.520]   terrestrial animal, or an avian, or an amphibian, for that matter.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.120]   And to make the wrong choice, to be an amphibian who's trying to fly, although I'm sure they're
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.500]   out there in the animal kingdom, it's not just a waste of time.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.860]   It's probably deadly.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.940]   And not to over-dramatize the failure of finding one's purpose, but I see it that way.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.500]   Because perhaps we could just say that the process of finding one's purpose is to realize
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.400]   like, ah, I'm an amphibian, I can go in and out of water, whereas a bunch of other creatures
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.140]   around me stop at the water's edge.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.660]   And this is really cool.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.740]   And a bunch of these other things, like these flying things, they can't actually even go
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.820]   in the water.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.660]   Some of them might be on the surface or dive into it, but they can't do what I can do.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.660]   So the process of self-discovery, it sounds like it's about restricting one's choices
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.660]   to a sort of wedge within the full landscape of options.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:35.140]   And for me, I can certainly recall after reading "Mastery," it helped me recall some early
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.180]   seed emotions that I experienced as a very distinct sensation in my body.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.180]   - Can you describe that?
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:49.180]   - Yeah, well, without making it too specific to my unique tastes, as a kid, I loved flora
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.180]   and fauna.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.180]   I loved learning about biology.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.180]   - Sure.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.500]   - I didn't know what else was there.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.040]   But animals and how they move in particular, and fish, and going to a proper aquarium store
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.420]   for the first time for me, and going snorkeling for the first time, it was like, wow.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.940]   And even as I describe it, it's almost like my body floats.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.460]   I feel it in my left arm of all things.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.500]   And it feels like there's something to do about it.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.980]   It's not just that I'm in observation of things that delight me.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.020]   It's like there's something, there's an activation state created within me, like I gotta do something
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   with this.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.900]   And typically, it's tell everybody about it until they won't listen anymore.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.240]   But oftentimes, it's to also draw those things, to think about them.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.300]   And I just delight in them.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.700]   It's a constant source of delight.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.580]   And so seeds such as those, and there are a few other things in that landscape of flora
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:41.140]   and fauna, and learning about animals and biology, including the human animal, and then
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.160]   organizing information feels so satisfying to me.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.380]   It's like a drug that...
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:52.140]   And so it just feels like this eternal spring of life, right?
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.680]   And so for me, that's what it was.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.580]   And in 2015, when I was teaching that course, the course I loved, but I was feeling a little
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.020]   bit astray in my scientific career.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.200]   And then I read Mastery, and I realized, yes, I love running a laboratory, I love teaching,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.420]   but there's something else for me.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.820]   And it has to do not with a podcast, I didn't even know what a podcast...
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.040]   I knew what a podcast was, I was listening to podcasts at that time, but I wasn't on
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   social media.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.300]   I had no thoughts of having a podcast, but what I wanted was that feeling in its total
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.500]   number of forms.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.820]   That's the goal, get that feeling in as many forms as possible.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.500]   Is that about...
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:36.260]   That's absolutely perfect, because the connection to what I'm talking about, it's not an intellectual
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.960]   thing, it's visceral, it's emotional, it's physical, right?
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.660]   And you feel it in your body, and when you're doing it, it's like it's at your level, it's
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.700]   like you're swimming with the current.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.940]   You feel it, things are easy, everything clicks together, there's a delight.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.640]   Not everything is gonna be delightful, there's gonna be tedium involved, there's gonna be
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:00.060]   moments of boredom, but you're able to withstand the moments of boredom because you feel that
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.580]   deep overall connection.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.180]   So yes, that's precisely what I'm talking about.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.420]   I mean, for me, it's a little bit similar thing is I said about words, but the other
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:16.820]   thing that I was obsessed with when I was a kid was early human ancestors.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.500]   Don't ask me why, I just was so obsessed with our ancestors millions of years ago and how
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.260]   it's possible to be living here in the '60s or '70s with cars and everything, but to come
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.300]   to where we are now.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:37.180]   And I wrote a short story when I was eight years old about a vulture, it was written
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:42.100]   from the point of view of a vulture watching the first humans kind of emerge on the planet.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.540]   I'm sure it was absolutely awful, dreadful, but the weird thing is I'm writing a new book
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.420]   and all I'm doing in that book is going into early humans.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.640]   And I feel like a kid again, I'm so excited, I'm so happy.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.780]   So I can very much relate to your story.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.060]   You mentioned these five different forms of intelligence or frames of mind as you referred
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.420]   to them.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:10.700]   And I'm certainly aware that I lean towards a more intellectual interests, although as
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.540]   you pointed out, the excitement, the delight is visceral and the actions are actions, they're
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.700]   of the body ultimately.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   One has to draw, speak, write books, et cetera, to transmute that excitement into something
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.380]   real.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.980]   For people that are not as intellectually tuned, but maybe are kinesthetically tuned,
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.660]   for instance, I can only wonder what that's like.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.980]   I'm not completely uncoordinated, but I don't think I have a kinesthetic attunement or frame
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.980]   of mind.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:49.560]   But I, for instance, had a podcast listener mention that they think in feels, that they
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:56.980]   literally experience thought as a sort of a patchwork of bodily sensations.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:03.460]   And that thought for them is not of the stuff from the neck up, but only from the neck down,
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.640]   which to me was really intriguing.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.360]   And so I only raise this because there have to be, as you point out, there's an infinite
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.080]   number of different sort of orientations based on our unique DNA and experience.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:23.280]   But what do you think explains why these particular seeds, or as you point out, like the direction
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.160]   that the grain runs in the brain, I mean, it's partially gonna be nature, it's gonna
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.440]   be DNA.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.880]   But we're talking about this as if there's some exciting or awe-inspiring or delightful
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.000]   thing that captures us.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.240]   Can it be the other way too?
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:45.640]   Can it be, you know, one has a bad experience as a child in an intellectual environment
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:51.000]   and then decides, you know, I'm going in the direction, things of the body feel good, things
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   of the mind, of intellect feels bad.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.720]   And does it matter whether or not we are drawn to our purpose by recognizing what we love
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   or what we hate, or are both useful?
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.680]   - Oh, they're both very, very useful.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.440]   You know, a lot of intelligence is non-verbal.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.960]   We think in terms of images, we're very much infected by the emotions of other people.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.720]   So I know, for instance, my mother is very, very interested in history, she's obsessed
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.200]   with history, and I probably absorbed her interest in history.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.180]   I don't think there's a genetic gene for that interest, you know?
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.660]   So you're gonna absorb things from your parents as well, so it's not all just genetic.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.160]   But yeah, what you hate will have a big thing.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.120]   But the problem with doing that is if you go into a direction and you're in elementary
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.760]   school, et cetera, and they force you to learn math and you hate it, what it tends to do
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.180]   is it turns you off from learning in general.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.120]   You think, I don't want to be disciplined, I don't want to go through anything because
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.960]   it's painful, it doesn't lead anywhere, it's not me, it's frustration.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.480]   It turns you off from learning in general.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.560]   So it's really, really important for a child to have the love experience as early as possible
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.420]   so that they can know what they hate and why they hate it, right?
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.940]   And then they can rebel and they can go into that field, as opposed to, I hate learning,
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.840]   I hate discipline, I hate studying, I hate trying things over and over again.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.360]   If you're kinesthetically oriented, and you know, a part of me, I understand that because
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.200]   I love sports, is you have to practice.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.440]   It's going to take a lot of, you're not going to instantly be good at something, right?
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.400]   And that's going to require a love of it, right?
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.600]   But if your math experience, because I hate learning shit, you're not, it's going to transfer
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.640]   to sports, you're going to hate discipline in general.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.440]   So it's very important for parents to let that child have at least glimmers of that
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.760]   love moment.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   I know for me, when I finished college and I entered the work world, I had to get a job.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.360]   I got worked in journalism, I hated it.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.520]   I hated working for other people, I hated office politics, I hated all the egos, I hated
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.480]   the smarminess, I hated the lack of quality, it was all just about making money and getting
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.960]   things out there.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.400]   And then I worked in Hollywood, I hated Hollywood, I hated working in Hollywood.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.140]   That formed me very much, made me go in the direction that I went in, but only from the
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.140]   basis of, I knew that I wanted to be a writer.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.840]   So that's very important that it's not just hate, it can form you.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   But there also has to be that positive, deep emotional love of something that also is grounded
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.960]   in you in some way.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.800]   What you just said really highlights the fact that energy and motivation can come from either
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.960]   pressure, desire for something or desire to get away from something.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:19:00.100]   And earlier when you were talking about how we are so much more engaged and driven towards
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.380]   things that stir us emotionally, and actually we know based on the neuroscience as you know
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.060]   too, I'm sure that only by the release of certain neurochemicals in the brain and body
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.460]   would our brain have any reason to change, right?
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.940]   If you don't feel agitation and you can do everything that you're trying to do, of course
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.140]   your brain wouldn't change, like why would it, right?
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.280]   That agitation is a signature of the neurochemicals that are saying, "Hey, something's different
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   now."
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280]   - Right, right, right.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.440]   - You might need to do something different, including rewire yourself, right?
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.120]   And that can come from positive or negative experiences.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.720]   - Definitely, of course.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.840]   (upbeat music)
