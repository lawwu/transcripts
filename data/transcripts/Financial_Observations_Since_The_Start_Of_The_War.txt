[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.540]   There's this great quote from Lenin that says, "There are decades where nothing happens,
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.820]   and there are weeks where decades happen."
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.060]   And that's how I felt last week when the war broke out in Ukraine.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.620]   And it's a terrible feeling because there's so much uncertainty, there's so much sadness,
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.480]   and there's so much anger that something like this could happen today.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.960]   And there's also frustration because here in the United States, there's nothing you
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   and I can do about the situation except to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainians.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.140]   And as a parent right now, I just can't imagine having to flee San Francisco to find shelter
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.340]   and then take my kids out of school, leave my house behind, and so forth.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.040]   So it's a really harrowing situation that I hope gets swiftly resolved.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   Otherwise there's going to be a humanitarian crisis.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.280]   If you haven't realized it by now, black swan events happen all the time.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.800]   They happen so often we might as well get rid of the term altogether.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.000]   Financial Samurai was born out of a black swan event, the global financial crisis of
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.520]   2008 and 2009.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.040]   I had come up with Financial Samurai in 2006 after graduating from business school.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.160]   And only after a financial crisis that was the worst in history that I say, "Okay, you
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.200]   know what, time to stop diddle-dalling, time to start this project that I've been thinking
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   about for so long."
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.080]   So this site's DNA will always contain a cautionary strand or two because if you've ever lost
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.200]   a lot of your money very quickly or your livelihood, such as if you got let go and you couldn't
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.280]   find work for years, you will never want to repeat that experience again.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.040]   So a lot of people over the years have said, "Sam, you write so cautiously.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   You always talk about these black swan events that aren't going to happen."
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.440]   But come on folks, since 2009 there's been a lot of things happening if you're paying
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.760]   attention and if you have real money at stake.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.920]   I mean, yeah, if you have several thousand dollars invested and things go down 30%, 50%,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   it's okay.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.800]   But if you have hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, kids to take care of,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.320]   parents to take care of, there's no messing around here.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.280]   There really is no messing around.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.760]   Money is too important to be left up to pontification, which is why I try to write and speak from
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160]   firsthand experience.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.240]   I am an ongoing student of finance.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.800]   No matter how much I write, how much I speak, there's always something new to learn.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.580]   And here are five observations since the start of the war.
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.840]   The first financial observation is this.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   Cryptocurrencies are not a defensive asset.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.520]   There has been some debate regarding whether cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.120]   are defensive assets.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   One idea is that as the US dollar loses its purchasing power, cryptocurrencies will eventually
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.320]   rise up and replace it.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.200]   The thing is the US dollar has appreciated since the pandemic began in 2020 and the war
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440]   began, not depreciated.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.280]   We're talking about a 5% appreciation in 2021 against a basket of currencies for the US
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   dollar.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.400]   So the US dollar really isn't going anywhere.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.560]   We approached the pandemic better than most countries.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.120]   Further, our stock market did better than most countries.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.760]   We're also a world reserve currency.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.500]   So the US dollar is not going anywhere.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.620]   So the idea that the US dollar depreciates to zero is probably not going to happen, right?
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.980]   And when it comes to finances, everything is relative.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.400]   So yeah, you could bash the US dollar, but if other countries and other currencies are
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.660]   not doing as well, then the US dollar is doing relatively well.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.820]   So in the morning when we all found out that Russia was going to invade Ukraine, gold surged
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.220]   higher and then Bitcoin collapsed.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.100]   And then once the stock market started turning around intraday, gold started rolling over
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.660]   and then Bitcoin started shooting up.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.580]   So bottom line is don't buy cryptocurrencies to hedge against a downturn.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.540]   Buy them for more beta on the upside.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.600]   Gold works as a much better hedge during times of uncertainty.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.900]   Cryptocurrencies should continue to be viewed as highly speculative investments with high
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   beta.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.660]   The second financial observation is that uncertainty kills the market.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.140]   Fear of the unknown is one of the biggest negatives for the stock market.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.020]   The greater the speculation about a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the more the stock market
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.020]   sold off.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.740]   And then only when the invasion actually occurred, did the stock market finally turn around and
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.740]   rally.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.520]   So we can all feel that uncertainty unfold in our bodies if we were paying attention
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.680]   up to the invasion, right?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.760]   The uncertainty creates anxiety, a lot of what-if scenarios in our heads.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.280]   You know, a lot of us think about worst case scenarios.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.820]   And then when you start thinking about worst case scenarios, you might end up doing things
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.160]   to prevent that worst case scenario from happening.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.120]   But usually the things in our head, the fears in our heads, generally are much, much worse
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.480]   than reality.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.840]   This is one of the key things that I realized when I left my job in 2012.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   Before you leave your job, you think, "What if you run out of money?
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.340]   What if you starve to death?
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.200]   What if you are thrown out on the streets?"
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.080]   A lot of things that could happen but likely aren't going to happen.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.900]   So as a result, it's a real mind bender before you take a leap of faith and do something
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.660]   completely different.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.800]   And this is why I want to constantly remind you folks that financial independence and
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.440]   doing things that you want to do is not just math.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.160]   It's not just math at all.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.240]   Math is maybe 30 to 40% of the equation.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.600]   Your mental strength, your mental health really is the majority of your ability to change
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.640]   your life.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.280]   So besides the fear of an invasion, here are other uncertainties that may hurt stock market
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.920]   performance to varying degrees.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.400]   Concern over the magnitude and the number of rate hikes by the Fed.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.240]   Since the invasion began, the expectations for the number of rate hikes have gone down.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.280]   The expectation that the Fed will hike by 50 basis points in March has also come down.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.720]   Two, fear over the outcome of a presidential election, especially if the potential candidate
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.400]   has some very extreme views.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.240]   Concern over a reduction in government benefits.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.080]   Worry over a new tax hike or change in tax policy.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.300]   Fear over the impact of a new deadly virus.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.680]   And fear that this war could get out of hand and create World War III.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.800]   So these fears are going to put a lid on stock market performance.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.200]   The more we know about an outcome, the more we can take steps to deal with the outcome.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.180]   However, if you really want to benefit, you've got to take a chance.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.040]   You've got to take action before that outcome is known because once that outcome is known,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.120]   it's going to be too late.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.200]   Here's the third financial observation.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.660]   Extremely powerful and wealthy people are willing to detonate their finances for their
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.480]   ideology.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.400]   So in some circles or in some estimates, Vladimir Putin is worth over $200 billion.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.600]   However, Putin was willing to detonate the Moscow Stock Exchange in order to go to war.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.720]   So on Thursday, February 24th, the day of the invasion, the benchmark Russia index closed
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.680]   down 33%.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.840]   That erased $189 billion in shareholder wealth.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.560]   And given Putin is a very wealthy man, he certainly lost a lot of money.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.080]   Meanwhile, the S&P 500 closed up 1.5% for the day.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.360]   How's that for a juxtaposition?
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.840]   This is the first time since 1987 that a sell-off of this magnitude has hit a market worth more
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.400]   than $50 billion.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.760]   In the aftermath of the Black Monday crash that year, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.560]   33%.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   The worst single day drop over the past century in any market of any size was Argentina's
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.120]   53% slump in January 1990, when the country was battling hyperinflation and a mounting
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.760]   economic crisis.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.120]   So the Russia index, the MOEX, trades at roughly 3 to 3.5 times forward earnings.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   That's it, folks.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.960]   And that's down from 5.4 times at the start of 2022.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.920]   Whereas the S&P 500 is trading at 20 plus times earnings, forward earnings.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:22.300]   So this discount in valuation reflects a risk premium that people aren't willing to pay
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.000]   a higher earnings multiple when there's so much uncertainty.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.480]   Sure, there could be a lot of upside if that uncertainty is removed.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.680]   Let's say there's a more democratic environment, better measures are put in place, checks and
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   balances.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.320]   However, let's not count on that.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.040]   Therefore, you should probably continue to overweight developed countries with highly
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.080]   functioning democracies.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.720]   The fourth financial observation is that compared to stocks, real estate is an oasis during
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   a war.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.960]   Obviously, cash is great as well.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.440]   If you own both stocks and real estate, as most of us do, think about the amount of time
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.620]   you spent worrying about your stock portfolio versus your real estate portfolio during the
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.160]   onset of the war.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.200]   Be honest with how many times you checked your stock app and logged into your online
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.720]   brokerage account before and after the invasion began.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.320]   Now think about how many times you thought about how your real estate portfolio was doing.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.120]   Did you really even care?
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.040]   If you're like most people, you probably worried much more about your stocks than your
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.280]   real estate.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.600]   It's only if you own real estate in a country that is being invaded where you begin to worry.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.920]   Depending on if the invading country wins and how aggressive they are, you could lose
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.020]   your property rights under a new regime change.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.540]   If you tend to be a more anxious person, stocks may not be for you.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.840]   And if you decide to own stocks, even though you're highly anxious, you need to figure
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.500]   out the appropriate net worth exposure percentage that you aren't feeling distraught with the
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.880]   urge to panic sell anytime there's a big downturn.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.980]   I talk about this with the financial seer formula.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.040]   And essentially, you want to equate your potential losses to how many months you would need to
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.640]   work to make up for those losses.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.160]   So I'll link to that post in the show notes.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.300]   But at the end of the day, money is time.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500]   And the older you get, the more valuable your time will get.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.120]   And therefore, the more valuable your money will be, and the more you'll want to protect
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.420]   your capital.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.500]   If you are feeling particularly jittery or moody during the latest war or geopolitical
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.780]   event, then you should probably lower your stock exposure.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.740]   And on the other hand, if you've gone about your business without feeling any stress,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.320]   you didn't check, you just kind of were happy go lucky, then you should probably increase
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.240]   your stock exposure.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.660]   Only you will know how you feel.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.920]   So figure it out.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.900]   The fifth and final financial observation is that big intraday reversals haven't proven
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.560]   to be good omens.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.200]   When the Russian invasion began, the NASDAQ began the day down 3.29%.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.020]   It then ended up the day positive 3.36%.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   The S&P 500 started the day down 2.59%.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.280]   It ended the day up 1.5%.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.240]   These are massive reversals.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.760]   However, when you look at history, when the NASDAQ had a plus 5% intraday reversal from
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.100]   the open, they all happened during the 2000 tech bust.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.920]   And they happened multiple times between 2000 and 2002.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.200]   And then it happened again during the housing crisis, right?
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.640]   In 2008, 2009.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.560]   So in other words, they all happened during bear markets.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.400]   I clearly remember the 2000 dot bomb starting in 2000 because I started working in finance
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.980]   in 1999.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.800]   There were a lot of false hopes, many, many false hopes.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.480]   The first couple of years, ah, things will be OK.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.620]   Things will be OK.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.680]   And after about a year and a half of declining, we just kind of capitulated and said, you
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.680]   know what?
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.480]   Things are not OK.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.280]   And it was just, OK, the denial was just acceptance that we weren't going to make money in the
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.400]   NASDAQ and in technology stocks.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.480]   Any longer.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.600]   And then after about three years, right, starting in around 2003, things got a little bit better.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.000]   But after topping in 2000, the NASDAQ really didn't reach that level until about 2015,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   2016.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.560]   So that's over a decade of waiting to get back to even.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.200]   Now, currently, things are correcting much, much quicker.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.800]   You're seeing a lot of the tech stocks correct by 60 to 80% in just six months.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.640]   So the cycle of change is much quicker now.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   The velocity is very quick.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.840]   However, I wouldn't look at these huge reversals as something of a good omen just based on
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   history.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.920]   I would just continue to have a lot of skepticism about the latest turnaround.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.840]   There will undoubtedly be more volatile times ahead.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.240]   So those are my five financial observations since the start of the war.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.560]   I'd love to hear what your observations are.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.440]   There is also one final point that is something worth thinking about.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.240]   A war could ignite a bull market.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.880]   If you look at history, during a recession, governments tend to spend and print more money
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.000]   to get their economies going again.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   For example, on May 6, 1935, President FDR issued Executive Order 7034 establishing the
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.840]   Works Progress Administration.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.400]   Over its eight years of existence, the WPA put roughly 8.5 million Americans to work
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.280]   helping America get out of the Great Depression at the time.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.160]   And during a war, there's heightened military spending that creates employment and additional
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.280]   economic activity.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.240]   Also more money may be spent on innovation and technology that can carry through to the
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   economy.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.760]   However, there's obviously a cost to many other industries as well.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   The jury is still out on how a war affects financial markets long term.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.560]   Here are some points on how war might actually help the stock market.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.600]   One, it makes the Fed second guess their rate hike plans, which could help spur further
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   borrowing.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.880]   Two, it attracts more treasury bond buying, which helps put a lid on rising interest rates.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.560]   Three, may reduce consumption froth and reduce inflation as more people hold on to cash and
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.560]   spend less.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.920]   Four, it encourages more nations to collaborate, creating more opportunities for international
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   trade.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.120]   A lot of good comes out of darkness, generally.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.480]   Think about a lot of the companies that were formed in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.760]   And then finally, it might motivate more people to spend more money on goods and experiences,
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.880]   given we realize that wars, pandemics, all of these things are proving that life is quite
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.840]   ephemeral and quite fragile, that we might as well spend more of our hard-earned money
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   and live a better life.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.960]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   Let us pray and hope this latest conflict will resolve itself quickly and peacefully.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.440]   Please spend some time reaching out to friends, hugging your loved ones and your children,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.600]   and just cherish them.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   Cherish every single day.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.280]   Thanks so much, and take care.
