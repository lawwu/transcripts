[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Welcome back everybody. Well, what is
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   lukewarmness and what barometer would we use to gauge whether or not we are lukewarm ourselves?
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.880]   Pastor John offered a clear definition and a gauge for us to use in his sermon on
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.120]   Revelation chapter 3 verses 14 to 22, a text that includes Jesus's words to the church in Laodicea
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.640]   where he says they are "lukewarm and neither hot nor cold."
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   And then of course Jesus threatens to spit them from his mouth in Revelation 3.16
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.840]   It's a haunting text. So what is
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.120]   Lukewarmness? Here's Pastor John to explain in a sermon he preached way back in 1983
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.720]   The essence of lukewarmness is the sentence. I don't need it. I
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   Need nothing. I
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.280]   Have enough of Jesus. I walked the aisle one day and he came into my heart and I have him I don't need anything
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.680]   The lukewarm are spiritually self-satisfied
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.120]   To find out whether you are among that number now
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:22.080]   Don't look in your head and ask whether you think that you're a sinner because you all do you've been well taught
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.120]   The way to tell whether you are among the number of the spiritually self-satisfied is to look at your
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.760]   prayer life
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.240]   There's the barometer
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.120]   To tell whether we are in the bondage to spiritual self-satisfaction
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.880]   The question is how frequently how earnestly how?
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.440]   expectantly how
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.560]   Extendedly do you strive with God to have a deeper knowledge with Christ?
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120]   greater earnestness in prayer
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.480]   more boldness in witness
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.240]   Sweeter joy in the Holy Spirit. Do you long for deeper sorrow for sin warmer compassion for the lost?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.000]   More divine power to love are you going after God in your prayer life?
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.200]   hard every day often long and if not, that's the barometer of
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.800]   Whether you're spiritually self-satisfied
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.680]   Not what you think about yourself in your head
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.360]   Does the coolness and the perfunctory nests of your prayer life?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.320]   stack up to exhibit a
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.000]   That you are spiritually
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.760]   Satisfied and
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.320]   therefore
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.880]   lukewarm and therefore on the verge of being
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.400]   spit out of his mouth
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.720]   Now Jesus has a word to you and to me
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.440]   If we think we need nothing at the beginning of 1983 if there's no sense of desperation in our hearts
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.000]   for change
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.800]   People who think that it's a bit mellow dramatic a little overdoing it a little bit
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.320]   to
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960]   Have an all-night
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.360]   Prayer meeting and Friday as though there were some
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.280]   Volcano about to come down upon us
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.440]   Well, there is in verse 14 and 15 a volcano about to come down on lukewarm people
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.280]   here's what Jesus word of
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.440]   Assessment is you are in fact wretched and pitiable and poor and blind and naked
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.640]   Now remember that's Jesus talking. I didn't choose those words for sermonic effect
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.360]   Those are the words of Jesus. That's the way he looks down through that ceiling upon churchgoers
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.560]   Who don't have any passion for change in?
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.000]   your life
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   Who are quite content to go on day in and day out with two minutes with the Lord?
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.360]   And such churchgoers if they don't begin to do something to change will eventually be spit out of his mouth now
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.480]   That's the threat and that's the indictment here comes in verse 18 the council
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.240]   counseling is big business today and
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.280]   Many of you with me are involved in it and I just want to say in passing
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.740]   Don't just read books about counseling study the master counselor
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.320]   See that word counsel there in verse 18. This is counseling at its best
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.800]   fret
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.080]   promise
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.120]   We're gonna see the sweetest promise you ever heard before we're done. But before he gets there
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.820]   The awful threat here comes the council the word in between what are they to do?
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.600]   Therefore I counsel you buy from me gold refined by fire that you may be rich
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.920]   White garments to clothe you keep your shame your nakedness from being seen and salve to anoint your eyes that
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   You may see
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.760]   Christ's will for the church is not to spit it out
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.080]   His will for the church is that our poverty be replaced with wealth
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.120]   That our nakedness and shame be clothed with robes of righteousness and obedience
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.320]   And that our blindness be healed so that we see like God sees and assess everything
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.640]   the way he does
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.360]   There's only one place where we can get that gold those garments and that medicine and that's Jesus himself
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   And that's why he says buy
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.640]   from me
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.320]   gold
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.520]   now
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   How do you buy gold when you're broke?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   He just said you are poor
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.800]   blind
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.080]   naked
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   miserable wretched
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   not only
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.720]   poor
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.880]   Not only broke but blind you can't do any work. You can't earn any money when you're blind
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.200]   And not only blind naked you can't even go out of your closet
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.760]   How do you get the wealth of Christ?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.600]   robes of righteousness and obedience and power to love
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.360]   Sav to make us wise with the wisdom of God when you can't even go out of your closet
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.280]   The answer is in verse 20 you don't go out of your closet you open the door and let Jesus in
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.880]   Behold I stand at the door and knock
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:39.920]   if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I'll come in and eat with him and
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.200]   He with me
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   now that verse
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.160]   Can be applied with
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.840]   Legitimacy to
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.080]   unbelievers
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.640]   But that's not its meaning here
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.960]   I want to drive that home that verse is addressed to Luke warm
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.160]   Christians who think they have Christ
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.680]   Sufficiently and he's just out there knocking on the door of the Christians heart
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:18.120]   It's addressed to Luke warm Christians who think they don't need any more of Christ. We've got his riches. We've got his garments
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.000]   We've got his medicine and he says you don't you're poor blind miserable
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.800]   naked and pitiable
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.480]   People who keep the door shut on the most inner room of their lives
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   People who want to keep the Lord on the porch and deal with him like a salesman
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.480]   You might want to buy the thing, but you don't want him to come in
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.800]   Mixed up in the deep places of your life
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.400]   Christ did not die to purify a bride
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.120]   Who would keep him on the porch while she watches TV and then?
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.600]   His will for the church is that we open the door all
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.720]   the doors of
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.640]   Our lives he wants to join you
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.160]   This is that sweet promise
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:13.120]   He wants to join you in the dining room of your life light a candle spread the table
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   Sit down with you
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.720]   Talk for an hour
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.080]   Just try to imagine the favorite meal you've ever enjoyed with the nearest and dearest friend you've ever had
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.920]   That's the experience Jesus wants with everybody in this room, and he's knocking right now and asking for it
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.240]   Wouldn't you take the time for me, please an hour?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.600]   So that I can eat with you and you with me and when Jesus Christ
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:49.440]   Comes into the room he brings with him all the gold all the garments and all the medicine in the world
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.480]   To have Jesus is to have everything
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.720]   So how do you buy gold when you're broke?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.880]   You pray
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.920]   You start opening all the doors of the deep recesses of your life
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.040]   and you appeal to him to come into every single sphere and
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.760]   Be at home and sup with you and you with him I
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:18.000]   Just confess very personally there is an intimate communion and fellowship with Jesus
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.280]   I crave in 1983 this sermon is a sermon for me. I'm not I'm not damning you I
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.040]   Preach the way I do because I want so bad
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.720]   to have the fullness of Jesus Christ
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.480]   more than I've known him before and I want us to share it as a
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.600]   congregation and
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:47.080]   When he comes and dwells in the innermost room of our affections. There's gonna be power
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.560]   Power to love
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.440]   That's what we all want more than anything
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:00.040]   I said on New Year's Eve power to overcome all the crummy desires that pull us around by the nose and
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.200]   Floored it over us when Jesus comes in and has dinner with you by candlelight
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.040]   You've got power to overcome all the allurements of the world
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.800]   powerful excerpt from Pastor John sermon on Revelation 3
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.680]   14 to 22 titled how to buy gold when you're broke

[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.800]   But should the straight-up offer of a cash bonus be a good motivator for our labors
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.080]   Can the desire for more money in this case a bonus?
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:29.000]   Be desirous in a virtuous way or is this simply the love of money? How can we tell the difference?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.800]   It's a really good question and it's up next time on Friday. I'm your host Tony Reinke and we will see you then
