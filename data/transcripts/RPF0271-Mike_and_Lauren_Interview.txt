[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.600]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I bring you a story.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.080]   This is an interview with Mike and Lauren, YouTube personalities and personal finance experts from Mikeandlauren.com.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:38.040]   They have a very cool story and it's worth your attention because they are cutting loose from the workforce at the age of 30 without ever really making a ton of money.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.880]   They didn't make a big business and sell it.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.320]   They never made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.920]   Just a normal couple who have followed their plan and are retiring at the age of 30.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:09.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.960]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   This is a fun one.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.680]   This is an inspirational and an educational version of the show.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.760]   Mike and Lauren do a really, really great job of sharing some of their ideas and some of their content on our YouTube channel.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.120]   And I was able to connect with them at FinCon 2015.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.280]   Get a few more details, which I can now bring to you.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:44.160]   One of the things I do want to do is provide you with other ideas and opportunities.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.960]   I've got this weird idea that the world is a big place and that the pie is as big as we make it and there's not really any competition.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.640]   And sometimes different people resonate with different formats.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.360]   So for example, those of you who listen to this show consistently, you guys resonate with a podcast format.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.600]   There are people who just flat out are not going to take the time to sit and listen to a long format podcast.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.480]   But they might listen to a short clip of a podcast.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.120]   So there are podcasts that I think could do a good job there.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.560]   Some people don't want to listen to audio.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.120]   They just want to read because that's a much more efficient use of their time.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   So there are great blogs.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.000]   There are great books.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.960]   Some people like YouTube videos.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.240]   And there's a real dearth of content online in the personal finance YouTube space.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   Hint, hint, hint.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.840]   This is an opportunity for some of you who might be able to produce interesting and useful content there.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320]   I very much see the opportunity.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.000]   I very much personally would like to capitalize on the opportunity.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.400]   But it is beyond my core skill set.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.800]   I've tried to figure out how do I do this because I see the opportunity and it's out there.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   So Mike and Lauren, however, are one of the people who are involved in the YouTube space and who are doing a good job of integrating the principles of personal finance, the principles of early retirement, the approach, and also doing it and sharing it with other people.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.200]   They have a very cool story.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440]   Now, this interview was recorded in – what was it?
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.880]   August, so a few months ago now at FinCon 2015.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   But since that time, there's actually been some exciting changes in their life which I will announce at the end of the interview.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.400]   It's worth staying tuned for some of the details that they have to share with us and quick updates since the time of recording.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.440]   Before I play the interview for you, two sponsors for today's show.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.360]   I want to share with you some information about them.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.520]   Sponsor number one is Jay Fleischman, host of the Student Loan Show.

[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.280]   That's kind of a big deal because anywhere we can cut expenses is important and Jay will help you pay less money on your student loans.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.520]   The coolest thing for you, the listening audience, is he offers a consulting package where he will share with you and do a review of your student loans for you.

[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.920]   call Jay especially then.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.840]   Instead of being able to save you bucks, he might be able to save you big bucks.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.360]   He's a real expert in that space.

[00:04:49.280 --> 00:05:00.720]   Paladin is an excellent service where they go through and they vet financial advisors before the fact and present you with a customized tailored list so that you can reach out to a financial advisor,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.400]   interview them to see if they will be able to serve you and work with you and give you some really great options that are pre-vetted for you.

[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.440]   Mike and Lauren, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.560]   Thank you for having us.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.360]   We're excited to be here.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.160]   So, we're going to talk today about financial independence and a little bit about your story.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.960]   You guys are awesome YouTube creators and there's not many people in the YouTube financial independence space, right?
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.680]   There is not.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.040]   No, there's five or six of us.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.160]   Do you know anyone else who's actually doing it?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.320]   Like who are some of the other channels that are actually talking about the subject?
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.720]   Yes, there's Letitia Stiles at Young Finances.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.240]   What's your name?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.360]   Lauren Bolling.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   Okay, yeah.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.240]   Lauren and LB in the Money Tree.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yes.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.520]   There's two or three others.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.560]   I'm trying to think.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.000]   Not off the top of my head, I can't think of anybody.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.040]   Yes, there are quite a few.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.680]   Awesome.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.640]   So, let's talk with your story surrounding financial independence.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.360]   When did you guys get turned on to this idea of saving your way to financial freedom?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.480]   This was all Mike.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.280]   Yeah, so it started when I was about 17 or 18.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:31.520]   I was listening in the car with my dad to a Dave Ramsey show and he was telling the story of the young investor who started at 19 and stopped at age 26 and the other investor started at 26.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.440]   And for the rest of his life, the younger investor ended up with more.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.960]   That magic of compound interest for me was really eye-opening.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.560]   And that was not our eye-opener financial independence necessarily, but just personal
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.360]   finance in general.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.440]   It was a whole new world to me.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.280]   I started reading every blog I could.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.640]   I found J.D. Roth back in the day, Jacob at Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.600]   Read up on that.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   And then it wasn't until a couple years ago that we really saw -- we had always saved
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.840]   about 50% of our income just naturally for real people, so that was just how it started.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.560]   And then we were looking at the numbers and we realized, "Hey, if we just bump up our
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.280]   savings rate just a little bit, we could achieve financial independence at a very young age."
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.840]   And so we went for it and that's where we're at now.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   Lauren, you say it was all Mike.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.360]   What was your philosophy around money?
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.280]   Well now, it was all Mike because I never would have found it on my own.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.800]   But I've known Mike, we're high school sweethearts, so I've always kind of heard the ideas from
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.280]   him.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.240]   And so I learned these things sort of with him.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.440]   And so I like to say that I was usually a few steps behind him, that I would eventually
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.800]   get on board, but he kind of had to give me some time to warm up to the idea.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   So again, with the, "We could do this in a few years, let's just save 75% of our income."
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.560]   And I thought, "Really?
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.520]   We're going to do that?"
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.200]   And then, you know, after a few days I thought, "Okay, let's try it, see what happens.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.480]   What is the worst that we could do?
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.280]   Save some extra money and then say, 'Eh, it's not really for us.'"
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   Right, right.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   When, for you Mike, when was your eyes open to financial independence?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.320]   Because there's a huge chasm between, "Oh, save 15%," Dave Ramsey, "Save 15% of your
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.800]   income for retirement and then go on down the baby steps," versus Jacob, early retirement
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.360]   extreme, save 75% of your income.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.400]   How were your eyes opened?
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.800]   And it was Mr. Money Mustache that, yeah, because Jacob, you know, living on $7,000
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.920]   a year, I could honestly-
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.360]   Your wife loves to hear that idea.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.160]   She did not.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.280]   Those were one of the ideas that, that was one of the ideas she couldn't warm up to because
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.880]   I love the idea of living in an RV.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.560]   I love the idea.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.000]   In my head, we've never actually done it.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.560]   So who knows if I would actually love that, but so maybe she's balancing us out.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.160]   But when Mr. Money Mustache showed his budget and he's not, you know, living in, you know,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.640]   scarcity, that was really an eye opener that he's living like we're living now.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.680]   That's something we could do.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.080]   Sounds exactly like my relationship with my wife.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.680]   I would be, I'm all over the $7,000 a year in an RV and she's a little more practical
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.480]   than that.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.640]   So in between there, there's the, you know, $25,000, $30,000 a year budget that's, you
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.680]   know, a little more reasonable.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.080]   So explain your current plan of financial independence and articulate the details for
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.920]   those who aren't familiar with the concept.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.320]   Okay.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.880]   So for us, financial independence, because that word financial independence is pretty
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.720]   set in stone, but retirement kind of has, you know, a variable definition.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.920]   For us, financial independence is when all of our basic living expenses are covered and
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.360]   maybe not necessarily all the luxury we'd want in our life, but we have a roof over
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   our head, food on the table and, you know, doing the things that we want to do.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.040]   And for us, that number is saving around $420,000.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:42.320]   And with the 4% rule, that would give us around $17,000 a year, I think is $1,700 or something.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.240]   And that is the budget that we set up.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.080]   And so if we achieve that savings, then our basic living expenses would be covered.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.600]   And then after that, any work that we take on, whether it be just for hobbies or, you
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.160]   know, just general, just work that would go to more luxury in our life.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.000]   And so currently we are just about halfway to that point.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   So we started about a year and a half ago.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   We have a year and a half or two left.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.720]   How old am I?
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.240]   I'm 28, right?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.880]   So we're three years.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.440]   Oh, we're way ahead.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.160]   The goal is 30?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.440]   You're going to do it by 30?
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   By my 31st birthday.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.140]   Awesome.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.240]   So it would be at 30, yeah.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.720]   Awesome.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.400]   So you actually live on $17,000 a year now?
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.960]   That's... so no.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.920]   Yes and no.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.120]   It's pretty close.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.320]   We spend right now for our core expenses, almost just about that.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   We're really spending more like $20,000 or $25,000.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.120]   But we have our YouTube channel that we're spending, you know, a few hundred dollars
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.520]   a month on.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.000]   We're doing...
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.120]   We're traveling a lot.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.760]   We know we're leaving for Norway as soon as we get back from FinCon.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.240]   Awesome.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.000]   So the things that are important to us, we're still spending on and...
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.280]   We're finding ways to make up that extra money that we're spending.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.560]   And our YouTube channel.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:54.880]   Yes.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.440]   YouTube is eventually growing into that.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.960]   And then we, you know, let's sell some stuff on Craigslist because we need to make up for
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.520]   this gap.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.280]   And we got some sponsorships recently, so that's helping that also.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.680]   So we're not just kind of waiting or pushing back the timeline.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.480]   There's a real tendency for me to want to stick to that real strict budget just for
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.440]   the people online.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.640]   But I'm like, this is real life.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.040]   Let's, you know, if it happens, it happens.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.800]   Like, this is what we're going for.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.080]   But we're not going to...
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.600]   We're going to Norway with eight of our friends.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.880]   So we're not going to like miss out on that trip just so for our readers, it's like cut
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.640]   and dry, line in the sand, no more than $17,000 a year.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.720]   But how do you actually do that living in Florida?
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.920]   Because you don't live in Mississippi.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.960]   You live in Florida.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.960]   That's a pretty hardcore...
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.160]   Even $20,000 a year, do you own the house?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.760]   And you're saying, well, we don't pay any rent.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.480]   So that's how we do it?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.920]   Like Money Mustache does?
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.420]   Well, we...
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.920]   No, we actually love creative housing situations.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.280]   And for both transportation and housing, we've done really well creatively for our entire
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.000]   marriage, spending about half of the national average.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.080]   For whatever reason, that's just what it's always ended up.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.800]   When we were in New York City, we actually lived in New York City for three years.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.200]   Wow.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.120]   And so the average rent in our area was, I think it was $3,000 a month for...
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:13.360]   We were midtown east and just searching on Craigslist and found a lady that was renting
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.160]   her studio apartment.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.000]   So it was 296 square feet.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.120]   So it wasn't anything huge, but we paid $1,400 a month.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.760]   So we're literally half the average for that area.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.480]   And we're happy with it.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.280]   We loved it.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.840]   It was great.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.880]   I really miss it a lot.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.400]   We were in an excellent area.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.960]   And for our housing situation now, I actually work something out with work because I work
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.600]   for a church.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.640]   And so there's a tiny house on the property at 600 square feet.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.200]   And so that we have worked in at rent for 650, which in our area is about half of what
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.880]   national or half of the average rate for rents in our area.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.920]   And for transportation, we've always just ended up making money on cars because I love
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.880]   finding deals.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.120]   Right.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.760]   So I will find a good deal on a car and then we'll drive it for a little while and then
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.000]   sell it for either what we paid or sometimes a profit.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.480]   Wow.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.000]   Here's the comparison between New York City and Florida, though.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.480]   My wife and I, when we married for our first year, we lived in a 234 square foot studio
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:06.880]   apartment.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.280]   So we beat you.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   Excellent.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.080]   You guys are wasteful spendthrift.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.800]   What's wrong with you paying for the extra 30?
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.440]   I had a closet.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.880]   We shouldn't have gone for the closet.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.440]   Seriously.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   And a little studio in downtown West Palm Beach.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   And we paid $500 a month for that.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.200]   So $500 versus $1,400 is a good comparison in New York City.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.240]   But that is for two people in New York City rent.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.360]   That's the way to do it.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:29.920]   Right.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.920]   How do you find deals like that?
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.480]   Craigslist.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   Honestly, I'd love to say it was it would be something more creative than that.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:44.400]   But it's just about when we want something, we start looking at Craigslist and we're refreshing
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   every 15 minutes to an hour.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.120]   And when I know we wanted a Prius as our car, I set up notifications and you have to be
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.120]   the first person to call and you have to go immediately no matter what you're doing during
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.360]   the day.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.400]   You have to drop it.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.600]   And there's the same thing with the apartment.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.040]   Lauren never saw it before we rented it.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.600]   It went up.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.320]   I called.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.040]   We rented it.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.520]   That was it.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.880]   Wow.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.000]   How do you set up notifications on Craigslist?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.640]   We have an app.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.040]   It's called Craigslist Pro or Craigslist Plus.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.960]   And it'll send you text updates for your search queries or if something gets posted
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.080]   to a category.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   That's a useful tool because I've looked in the past to try to figure that out and I haven't
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.880]   been able to find that.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.920]   So Craigslist Pro.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.080]   I think it's $2 in the App Store.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.560]   So what do you actually do for work?
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   I work for a church.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.560]   And so it's kind of the Florida megachurch style.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.760]   And so I do all the lighting, sound, and camera stuff.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.560]   So I do production.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.720]   And that's how we kind of got into the YouTube thing is I was familiar with cameras and things
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.040]   like that.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.000]   I actually work for a jewelry store, which is what brought us to New York.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.480]   I went to the Gemological Institute of America.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.680]   So I am a gemologist, which is kind of random.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   And so I work for a really cool family-owned jewelry store at home.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.080]   So the YouTube thing is one of the themes that I wanted to talk to you about.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.480]   This seems to be, for those who watch YouTube, like the perfect thing.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.320]   After all, all you need to do is just grab a camera, start filming your life with you
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.760]   walking around with your selfie stick, toss it on the Internet, and you make millions
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.400]   of dollars, right?
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.760]   After all, the Shaytards did it.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.240]   Exactly.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:10.960]   Instantly famous.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:17.200]   What are the realities of building a business and earning money on a YouTube channel?
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.320]   The reality is it's a lot of work for not a lot of money.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.960]   We currently spend about 100 hours a month on our two videos per week that we put out.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.080]   And for advertising, last month we made $400.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.560]   So that works out to about half minimum wage.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.480]   You would definitely be better off delivering pizzas if you're getting into it for the money.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.960]   However, once you have an audience built, then you can follow traditional blog methods
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.560]   of monetizing with digital products and sponsorships.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   And we've actually just had recent success with sponsorships with two national brands.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   And I think we can say in progressive insurance and H&R Block.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.600]   And they paid us to make content for their websites.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.440]   So that was really cool because that was a win-win-win.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.800]   Our fans get extra content if they want it.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.040]   The brand gets original content and we get paid.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.440]   And for those, we were paid over $1,000 a video.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.480]   So that's definitely something more lucrative once you have an audience established.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.840]   This started as a hobby though, right?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.240]   You posted videos of your honeymoon.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.280]   Our backpacking trip.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.120]   And so it was just sort of a way for friends and family to follow our trip.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.320]   It was, there was no intention of ever promoting it or having more people watch it.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.760]   It was just so that we could say, "Hey, we went to Europe and this is what we did."
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.080]   Right.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.480]   And the, uh...
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.360]   Crap, what was I going to say?
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.600]   I don't know.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.080]   Hobby.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.880]   Started as a hobby.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   Thank you.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   Perfect.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.400]   Yes.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.080]   So we love making videos.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.040]   It's a hobby that we have.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.480]   And we would definitely make YouTube videos, even if there was no money involved.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.080]   Albeit, we would not be making two videos a week.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.360]   That's a lot of work.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.880]   But if you don't love it, I definitely wouldn't recommend getting into it.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.320]   There's easier ways to do it.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.560]   So with regard to your financial independence plan, when you reach that, so what percentage
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.080]   of your income do you save now?
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.840]   We shoot for 75%.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.000]   Realistically, we're looking in the 65 to 70%.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.960]   Okay.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.360]   And so you're targeting a couple, three more years.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.480]   Do you have any idea of what you'll do at that point in time?
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.920]   That's the thing.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.200]   Back to creative housing.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.840]   Yes.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.520]   Well, we get a lot of questions.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.880]   Well, I don't want to retire early.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.640]   I don't ever want to stop working.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.320]   And we don't want to stop working.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.600]   We just want to pick and choose what we do and when we want to do it.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.760]   So we can do the things that we love and when we want to.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.640]   And our plan right now, at least, after we achieve financial independence, is to live
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.880]   on a sailboat and do some sailing around the world, which comes back to that creative housing.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.880]   What are we going to do when we only have $1,700 a month?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.760]   Or I'm sorry, $1,400, $1,500 a month coming in.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.760]   That's a realistic budget for sailing the world on a sailboat in a small space.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.680]   If you talk to a financial advisor, any mainstream financial advisor, and also,
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.080]   even if you start posting in some early retirement forum, and you tell them,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.840]   "All right, we're 30 years old and you're similar age," right, Lauren?
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.200]   I'm actually a year and a half younger.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.000]   Okay, so a little younger.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.200]   We're about 30.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.400]   And our plan is to save $428,000.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   And we're going to live on under $2,000 a month for the rest of our life.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.040]   The response will be, at the minimum, you're naive.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.280]   Right.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.760]   And at the more normal, you're stupid.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.000]   Yep.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.160]   What do you have to say to those critics?
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.920]   Well, what we have to say first is that we don't plan on living on just $1,400 a month or less.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.240]   We plan on pursuing our hobbies.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.400]   So right now, I'm really into woodworking, building things, making things.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.120]   And we can't-- and our YouTube channel is a hobby.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:45.360]   And inevitably, we're going to be making a lot more money than just our financial
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.120]   independence budget from our hobbies.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.560]   And if we're not, we'll have to go back to work.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.480]   That's what I love to say to those criticisms is, "What's the worst case scenario?"
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.200]   In your wildest dreams, our plan doesn't work out.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.120]   What's the-- we go back to work like everybody else?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.000]   Right, right.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.520]   And we have half a million dollars in the bank?
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.080]   How is that a bad, worst case scenario?
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.760]   So I've always said this in the comments of our blog to that kind of criticism.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.320]   If we're not millionaires by the time we're 40, then we did something wrong.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.720]   Because we're going to be making money, and we're not going to need that $1,400 a month.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.360]   That-- and that's just going to compound and build on itself.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.880]   And money is not going to be an issue.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.640]   I don't know how to-- there's just a gut feeling.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.600]   I can tell, like--
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.640]   Right, right.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.600]   It's not going to be a problem.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.920]   Well, also, if you just consider-- and I think Jacob Lundfisker,
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.400]   early retirement extreme, always made this point very well,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.920]   especially in his book, which has been a strong recommendation on this show.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:36.240]   The type of person who's able to, number one, build financial independence for themselves,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.040]   and number two, live a frugal lifestyle, is an extremely well-rounded person.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.400]   Where if you wanted to get a job, you're not-- you don't have a resume that simply says,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.640]   "Oh, I did this one job in this one career."
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.760]   You have a resume that says, "I have skills in dozens of areas."
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.920]   And you can take your pick of the housing market.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.600]   And with your many skills, you are much more resilient,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.360]   personally, to be able to find all kinds of new ways of earning money.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:01.760]   Exactly.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.000]   And much more adaptable to any situation.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.720]   If we're having trouble finding work, we already have experience cutting back on our budget.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.040]   So, exactly what you said.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.840]   We're building skills in retirement or in financial independence that,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.520]   if we should have to go back to work, we're building those skills to go back to work.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.600]   There's somebody who's close to me in my life, and this person has an amazing story
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.680]   where they spent years working as a truck driver.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.960]   And they got to their middle age, and as a truck driver, they didn't have much money,
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.480]   working for a large beverage company.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   But they said, "I'm done."
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.360]   And they quit.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.880]   And they switched.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.080]   And instead of working on truck driving, they started to build a real estate business.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.680]   So, they were very handy.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.280]   He was very handy with his hands and was able to work and work on houses.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.160]   Well, he didn't have much money, but he bootstrapped his way into the first couple of houses,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.720]   buying them for cash, never borrowed money on these properties,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.480]   but finding the cheap properties, fixing them up, flipped a couple here and there,
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.120]   and fixed others up, kept some as rentals.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.600]   Well, fast forward, they hit financial independence.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.280]   Well, number one, in many ways, he was job independent from the beginning,
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.040]   because he just said, "That's it. I'm done."
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   He filled in the income gaps with all of these crazy little things,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.200]   making money on all these just weird things, finding a lawnmower here,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.640]   and some guy, "Hey, I'll give you 20 bucks for the broken ticket home.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.680]   Fix it. Flip it on Craigslist during the grass season for $180."
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.600]   You just make $100 here, a couple hundred dollars there,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.000]   and it was due to his physical skills.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.240]   I mean, it's like he makes money on everything,
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.400]   but he doesn't make a lot of money on anything.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.360]   It's just a lot of little things with this diversity of skills.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.840]   Fast forward, they're financially independent eight or nine years later
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.400]   with a number less than 10, but more than five rental houses that provide for them,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.040]   and he still makes money on everything, just flipping things.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.840]   And it's something that I believe in what you do and what you show on-
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.160]   You're describing our plan for financial independence right now.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.200]   Because on your show, you're demonstrating even you've got this weird
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.120]   financial independence and DIY thing.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.440]   Exactly.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.880]   And you're building a diversity of skills that are applicable to,
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.240]   number one, the needs of life.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   "Hey, my wife needs a jewelry cabinet, so I'm going to make one."
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.200]   And also, those skills have value in the marketplace.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.960]   "I'm going to make some custom pieces and sell a few custom pieces here and there."
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.520]   Exactly. For a friend, we built an Apple Watch charging station,
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.520]   and we were just flooded with emails asking for people to purchase them.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.520]   And of course, we should build those and sell them.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.960]   That makes the most sense.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.400]   But it's not what I want to do with my time right now.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.680]   We're happy with making videos.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.440]   So exactly as you said, I don't know where the money is going to come from,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.400]   but I know if we can cover our basic living expenses,
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.160]   the money is going to come for the luxury from other sources, just as you described.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   And if it doesn't, then our plan didn't work.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.360]   I mean, at least we have food on our table and a shelter and a roof over our head.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.000]   Exactly.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.960]   How much do you think you could sell those watch stands for
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.400]   if you were going to put them on Etsy or whatever?
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.800]   Probably $200 or $300, I would think.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.600]   That'd be my guess.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.040]   And in my mind, this is one of the values.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.160]   I encourage all of my listeners to start a blog, start a podcast, start a YouTube channel,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.200]   do something to start to establish a presence.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.800]   Because if you are just a skillful woodworker making cool stands,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   but you don't have an outlet for that, no one's going to find that.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.920]   On the other hand, I don't know if you're a skillful woodworker
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.480]   or you're a mediocre woodworker, but if you're a woodworker and you have a platform,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.840]   then you can make one watch stand as a project with a friend,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.120]   and all of a sudden you've got a business.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.680]   Exactly.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.400]   We've made a video exactly about that, that with an audience, it's unfair.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.760]   Like, because we're trying to teach this financial independence,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.120]   like this is what we're doing.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.880]   You could do it too, except that a big part of our plan is we have an audience
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.160]   to utilize and kind of leverage anything we want to do in the future.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.240]   We'll inevitably make money with an audience.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.840]   But anybody can do this.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.720]   Everybody can't do it with a big YouTube channel,
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.440]   but anybody can do it if they start to learn and understand a little bit of marketing ideas.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.960]   One of the backup backup backup backup plans, I keep lists of things.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.920]   Okay, Joshua, if you go broke and you got to start over again, what are you going to do?
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.520]   Or if this business fails, what do you do?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.360]   So I keep lists of these things.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.400]   But one of the simple ones that I have is, believe it or not,
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.880]   I would enjoy raising chickens and selling free-range pastured poultry.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.160]   So I've talked to other people who have done this,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.240]   and it's one of these silly little things where you start very small
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.800]   and you sell your birds before you even get them simply through basically Facebook.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.600]   And if you start little and you start advertising to people and you say,
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.240]   "Okay, I'm going to do 100 birds," and you go around all your friends,
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.160]   "Here's the plan. I'm going to do pastured poultry."
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.000]   You give them the price, blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.880]   You can sell all your birds before you get them based upon marketing through Facebook.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.400]   And then you sell them, you get referrals, more customers, and you build slowly.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.520]   So anybody can do something today.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.360]   The tools are so easy. It's not necessarily YouTube.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.240]   Exactly. Yeah.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.760]   And it's funny you say poultry because we had chickens ourselves.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.640]   We had to give them to friends.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.160]   We were having troubles with predators.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.200]   But we want to start that up again.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.360]   We want to have our own poultry and eggs.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.760]   So very funny you say that.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.600]   You mentioned that specifically because we've thought about that.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.560]   Right, right.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.600]   And this is how society in many ways used to be, right?
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.760]   You would market to your friends and neighbors,
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.840]   but in a local place with your sign, with your business.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.640]   Everybody knew what little cottage business you had.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.160]   Then we've gone into a system of employment where everybody just works at,
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.240]   "Okay, I do this job and I don't talk to people."
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.080]   But now there's almost a new phase.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.640]   And as the job market continues to shrink,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.880]   as companies continue to cut costs, many more people need something.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.680]   And if you've got something built up that's a thousand bucks a month,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.600]   and you know, "I could scale this up,"
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.960]   then in many ways you become or at least start to feel more confident.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.680]   You either become invincible or you start to feel more confident
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.600]   because however much the church is paying you,
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.400]   you can start making Apple watch stands and sell them on Etsy
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.320]   and replace it in an instant if you wanted to.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.040]   Exactly.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:03.120]   And it's something that I wish we could do a better job of explaining that to our audience
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.640]   because what you just put into words is what kind of our channel is about.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.080]   Yeah, you've got three minutes and 15 seconds.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.480]   Exactly.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.000]   We've got three minutes and 15 seconds.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.800]   Exactly.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.000]   So that's why our channel, we do not do a great job of building it as fast as possible
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.520]   because if we were going to build it as fast as possible,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.600]   it wouldn't be named Mike and Lauren because what does that mean?
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.040]   It wouldn't be about finance, DIY, travel, and woodworking
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.440]   because you would pick one niche and stick with it.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.760]   But the idea is that we're building all these skills and any one outlet,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.240]   just as you described, could at any point replace our income.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.680]   So the next one, which when people say you're naive,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.360]   and I know you have some perspectives on it,
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.720]   so I'm interested in hearing honestly, kids, how do they impact financial independence?
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.160]   Well, it's actually interesting that you bring that up because I am pregnant right now.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.040]   Congratulations.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.520]   So we have a boy that we're expecting in March.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.880]   So we're very excited about that.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.000]   And we've decided that I'm not going back to work after that.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.880]   So that kind of should be interesting.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.400]   So it's funny that just as, was it the same week or two days after we found out she was pregnant
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.240]   is when we started getting sponsorships for our channel.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.760]   And it was kind of like, okay, this is a weird timing that,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.400]   okay, this is going to be probably replacing her income.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.120]   And if her being home, it's something she can do from home,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.360]   we can replace her income, hopefully from our channel with digital products
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.120]   and sponsorships and that kind of thing.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.120]   And now back to the, we're doing a bad job of building our channel.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.160]   If we were just stuck to one thing, now it's going to be very baby related.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.440]   So we have a whole new section of our channel and a whole new audience that will hopefully build.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.040]   Are already saying how they're excited to see baby on a budget videos.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.200]   And then that that will be for the people who are already subscribers and then bring in
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.400]   so many others and how we're specifically kind of going to combat that,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.880]   that thing to our budget, the baby it's, it's getting creative about everything.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.920]   So our house right now is 600 square feet, but there's a laundry room in the back.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.560]   So instead of moving to a bigger house, we're going to convert that room for around $500 or
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.600]   so just put a drywall and and do that.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.960]   And then, you know, the sailing thing once we retire or financial independence is,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.760]   is going to be a very similar, you know, budget.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.000]   Our budget is not going to increase in the traditional ways.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.360]   You know, the figures $242,000, I think the average child is seven or 30% of that is housing.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.840]   Well, we're very creative with our housing situation.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.320]   20% or 16% is transportation because everyone goes out and buys a new SUV.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.920]   And so we just don't do that.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.080]   And based on people we've talked to, we're expecting it to add a few hundred dollars
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.720]   a month to our budget.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.280]   We're not that naive to think that, oh, everything's going to stay the same.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.120]   But it's, we can apply everything we've done in our life up to this point to the baby and
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   hopefully be creative with how we make money and how we save money.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.800]   Just call my wife and talk to her.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.960]   She is the wizard in this area.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.240]   I think for two kids, one two-year-old and one three-month-old, I think she's bought,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.720]   I think, two outfits total because they were things that she really loved and she wanted,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   she felt like she just wanted to buy an outfit.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.920]   And that's what I've started reading is the asking for hand-me-downs because a lot of
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.440]   people think, oh, they're having a baby.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.040]   They're going to want everything new.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.280]   And of course, that's not us in general.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.680]   So I've already started asking, oh, you have something?
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.320]   Can I get this?
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.120]   And so it's so great.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.440]   We've already, I've started storing things that we've received for free.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.480]   So I think that's really interesting.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.000]   One of the secrets that she uses is, number one, we never say no to when somebody gets
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.400]   to give something because then when people are picky, what happens is people often stop
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.120]   offering you stuff.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.560]   If you say yes, but you clarify that, okay, if I don't want this, I'll go ahead and dispose
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.640]   of it and move it down the stream for you.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.080]   Then people are happy to give you things.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.000]   And then once you get a reputation as a receiver, then people are willing to give you things.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.960]   So the first, when we bought our house, which is on the market right now, thinking just
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.440]   to make sure I'm right, the entire time we lived there, we didn't buy a single piece
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.400]   of furniture.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.040]   The entire thing was furnished with free furniture.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.280]   Now, it wouldn't have been on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.400]   And we had been planning to go ahead and, okay, we're going to go ahead and start buying
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.120]   some furniture.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.640]   But we lived there for over two years, three years, and we didn't buy a stick of furniture.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.480]   We haven't bought a single thing of baby clothes.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.240]   We haven't bought a single, we never bought the swing, never bought anything.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.080]   Because when you bring in together, number one, the blessings of a baby shower for those
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.240]   few things that are really nice that you need.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.200]   And number two, everybody is trying to get rid of kid stuff.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.400]   Because in our society, there's such a waste stream of kid stuff.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.480]   Any parent knows that their house is just bursting at the seams and parents love it.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.160]   And then the key is organization.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.680]   So we have bins, she's got bins laid out, boys clothes, these months, girls clothes
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.400]   these months.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.600]   And if you stay just a little bit ahead, you got to be thinking ahead, just like with everything
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.400]   in finance.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.480]   If you think just a little bit ahead, you can be prepared.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.120]   So we're going to move up the up sizes, put this batch away and bring on the next one.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.200]   I can't tell you how happy we are to hear that because we also just like it, we've never
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.440]   paid for a piece of furniture in our entire marriage.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.400]   And our plan is the same.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.960]   We don't plan on paying anything for baby clothes.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.640]   Just because as you said, there's this endless stream of everybody just...
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.200]   People wanting to get rid of things, so why not take them?
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.160]   And so that was our plan.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.400]   And it's nice to hear that that might actually work out.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.680]   Yeah, I've done some shows on it.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.120]   But even we have, most people are not interested in frugality.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.560]   But when people are, we have a few things like, for example, my wife is a genius at
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.280]   cloth diapers.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.600]   We are very interested in that.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   All right, so we can give you the speech off the air.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.240]   But you know, something as simple as cloth diapers, you take, it does require an upfront
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.680]   cost.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.240]   But even that, the average cloth diaper...
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.920]   So here's something that I think the audience will also enjoy and also you'll personally
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.420]   enjoy.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.840]   Have you researched the cloth diaper marketplace?
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.560]   Yes.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.680]   It is stunning.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.160]   I never would have guessed that the used diaper marketplace...
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.680]   And Lauren is shaking her head.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.600]   It's amazing, right?
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.480]   I know.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.920]   It's nuts.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.920]   The used diaper marketplace.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.720]   You never would have thought until you started looking into it.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.200]   It's one of the strongest secondary markets I've ever seen in my life.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.400]   The depreciation on cloth diapers is like 30%.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.840]   It's amazing.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.400]   It's nuts.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.240]   So we started looking at this and it blew my mind that, you know, here you have, you
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.800]   know, cars depreciate just like that.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.880]   And, you know, a couple of years of use on a car and you're at 40% of its original value,
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.480]   it seems like, especially some cars.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.080]   Cloth diapers, a couple of years of putting baby poop in them every day.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.200]   These things are still 70% of their value.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.700]   Right.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.860]   But she learned things.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.300]   So she bought a couple and some people gave them as gifts.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.260]   But then she went out and she went on FreeCycle and asked for diapers.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.380]   And what happens is the elastic gets stretched out and they're bad.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.060]   And so she would get all these diapers where the elastic was just stretched out, get some
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.460]   elastic and replace the elastic.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.660]   So her cost, she's got probably almost 100 diapers, I would guess, of different sizes.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.180]   Her average cost, I made her keep track of it just so she could tell me, it was like
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.980]   $3.10 a diaper or something like that.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.300]   Which when you buy these things, $20 to $30 is new.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.500]   But you take $3.10 a diaper, it makes all the difference in the world because you take
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.700]   away this $50 to $80 monthly expense that many parents face with disposable diapers and
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.780]   you replace it with the cost of water and the cost of detergent plus that upfront cost.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.260]   And then knowing they have a remainder value, you can take this cost that for many parents
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.460]   is, I mean, hundreds, maybe over $1,000.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.740]   And it turns in if you resell them, if you don't have more kids, you resell them and
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.300]   it's amazing.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.540]   So there's always a way no matter what.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.860]   But what happens is we're so trained as consumers to automatically think about, I need to go
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.220]   and buy that solution instead of looking for a creative solution.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:41.620]   Exactly.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.380]   I'm curious, how did you guys handle the birthing costs?
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.500]   Yeah, so we, that depends at different times.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:53.220]   We chose, that was one area where we spent a lot of money.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.980]   We chose to work with a midwife at a birth center.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:02.580]   And so those are covered under insurance based upon the costs of the deductible or whatever
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.620]   the insurance plan was.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.260]   And so with the first baby, I always had a high deductible health plan and that cost
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.860]   $5,000 with our son because that was my deductible.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.140]   So we paid $5,000 and birthing centers are not cheap.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:21.860]   But that was one area where I would personally, and I think most parents, you're not going
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.740]   to go cheap on the cost of your baby's birth.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.540]   Money is not the deciding factor.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.580]   The health and safety and happiness and experience of mom and baby is number one.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.420]   But that doesn't mean that you can't plan carefully for the cost and prepare.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:43.460]   And so what we spent a lot of time doing was working very hard to avoid the potential of
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.900]   having a C-section because there you go from essentially a $5,000 birthing cost to $35,000
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.060]   birthing costs under the US medical system.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:56.100]   So there were all kinds of things that we did systematically to prepare for birth and
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.780]   to do everything we could to influence the possibility.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.500]   There are medical emergencies in which case you can't avoid them.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.740]   And obviously that's where it's nice to have health insurance and plan ahead for that
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.460]   with a cover.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:14.020]   But you can do all kinds of things to prepare for that and that's how we handled that.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.500]   Something we're interested in and still need to do our research.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   So unfortunately we can't talk too much in depth about it, but as an overseas birth,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:26.100]   both to kind of shrink those costs a little bit, but also give our son the gift of dual
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:26.660]   citizenship.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.060]   >> Right.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.580]   >> Particularly, I mean we would love to have it.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.380]   >> An anchor baby.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.420]   >> Yeah, an anchor baby.
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.920]   Exactly.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.220]   Exactly.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.700]   We'd love to have it in the European Union, but that's really difficult to do.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.060]   They're very strict about that.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:42.740]   So we were looking at that as possibly in the South America or something like that.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.100]   I was just curious if you had any.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.100]   >> No, I don't have any insight on that.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.500]   I know that Patrick Schulte from Bumfuzzle wrote about that on his, because they had
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:57.220]   come back from their boating trip and then they were pregnant with their older daughter
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.020]   and they went to Mexico.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.260]   >> Mexico, yeah.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.860]   >> And they wound up having a C-section delivery with both of their kids.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   But the total cost, just paying cash, was a few thousand dollars, if memory is right,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.100]   three to four thousand dollars in Mexico.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:08.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.300]   >> So that could be something worth considering.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:17.460]   I want to talk practically for a couple minutes about how you actually do YouTube and how
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.100]   do you integrate frugality with YouTube?
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.540]   Are you guys frugal with everything else, but with YouTube you go out and you buy the
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.740]   latest, greatest gear and you've got thousands and thousands of dollars of gear?
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.020]   Is this your weakness?
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.100]   >> We do have thousands of dollars of gear, but like everything, there's always deals
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:32.580]   to be had.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.860]   The one thing that we did spend on was our camera, and that's the Canon 70D.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.220]   And it's a DSLR and it's unique to every other camera, particularly DSLRs, because of the
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:43.860]   autofocus.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.700]   So doing travel and stuff like that, we really wanted that.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.500]   I would say we have around four thousand dollars in equipment, but it's not necessary.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   If it's something you're interested in, the cell phone that you have takes 1080p video,
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.940]   but the audio is not there.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:05.540]   So we highly recommend doing some sort of external audio or even like a smart lav microphone
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.500]   to make sure you get good audio.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.380]   And as a podcaster, I'm sure you understand the importance of good audio.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:16.100]   And we would say that on YouTube, good audio is even more important than quality video.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.180]   We actually did a video comparison about that.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.380]   But so you can do it really well for $1,500 or less.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.100]   You can do it pretty good for $500 or less.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.220]   And then you can do it with the cell phone in your pocket if you're just getting started.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.980]   And most people wouldn't know the difference, honestly.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:37.300]   There's a YouTube video creators channel named DSLR Guide, and it's a young man in England,
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.100]   I believe.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:44.820]   And what I admire about him is he demonstrates in his videos the impact of skill versus money.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.940]   And he did a video demonstrating, he did the whole thing shot on a cell phone camera, and
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:57.220]   he showed the impact of skill with lighting to create a good looking product, sound and
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.140]   all of that just with a cell phone camera.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.460]   And watching that, somebody with the latest, greatest equipment, but none of the skill
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.580]   could not duplicate that with a $70,000 camera.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.900]   So as with many things, start with skill and practice skill first before buying gear.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.620]   Yep.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.060]   We would definitely invest, before investing in a camera, we invest in a good microphone
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.940]   and good lighting.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.220]   And honestly, if you don't even want to invest in lighting, daylight is a wonderful source
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.420]   of light for video.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.540]   How do you do the editing process?
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.980]   Do both of you work on it?
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.580]   Yeah, we both work on it.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.060]   We use Adobe Premiere to do the editing.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:33.220]   And usually what we'll do is I start on all the rough cuts and get it down to the three
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.260]   and a half minutes, three and a half to five minutes is what we aim for.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.260]   And then Mike will come in after that and kind of bump everything down a little bit,
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.900]   add the music and do some graphics for it.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.940]   Have people hired you to do other video productions for them?
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.460]   Yeah, that's recently.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.820]   Other than sponsors?
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.860]   Um, actually, not really.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:55.460]   Mike has done some at work, which is kind of how it started.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.020]   But other than that, no, no, not really.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.540]   So the reason I'm pointing this out is the sponsor stories are cool.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.460]   And you shared in your presentation here that I mean, you made quite a bit of money on those
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.500]   deals, which is awesome.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.060]   But again, skills.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:14.180]   So if somebody is trying to build a video business as their sole source of income, that's
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.740]   a challenging business to start and to scale.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.940]   But if you're building a hobby, making YouTube videos, you may not ever get a million subscribers,
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.340]   but your friends and your acquaintances, and as you share them on Facebook, will say,
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.620]   "Oh, so and so does video and they need some videos made for the company."
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.900]   And they'll say, "Can you do this?"
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.540]   And $1,000 here, $2,000 there revolutionizes the financial independence plan.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.100]   Absolutely.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   And if there's three areas with the skills that we have now, we could absolutely get
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.380]   into doing custom promotional for companies.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.620]   We could do real estate is a huge thing.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:50.180]   The multi-million dollar houses, particularly in Florida, agents are looking for high quality
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.980]   video of that.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.340]   And then the wedding business, if you tack the word wedding onto anything, it immediately
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   becomes a $3,000 to $5,000 product.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.820]   Did you have an expensive wedding?
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.020]   Did you have a frugal wedding?
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.180]   We were pretty frugal.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.660]   My grandma did the cooking, and we're very lucky that the church that Mike works for,
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.820]   and that's how we met.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.540]   We met at youth group at church, and so we've been there forever.
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.540]   It seats how many people?
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.180]   1,200.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:19.700]   And so we didn't have to scale anything back, and where we had the reception was kind of
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.020]   open.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.060]   So we had a really big wedding, but it wasn't that expensive.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.700]   You know how much we spent?
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.380]   I think it was under $10,000, wasn't it?
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:25.620]   It was.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.060]   So it wasn't on the really frugal scale, but it wasn't $28,000 either.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.820]   Do your friends get you?
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.780]   Yes.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.140]   Surprisingly, yes.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.980]   We're very lucky with the group of friends that we've had, that we've grown up with.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.700]   Mike and I have had the same friends for 15 years.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.060]   And so sometimes they'll give us a hard time, and sometimes it's a running joke.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.100]   We're always at the butt of a joke, but they at least get it.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.740]   Have any of them started to follow your path?
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.380]   Actually, we're seeing a lot of our younger friends very interested in what we're doing,
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.060]   which is really, really cool to see.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.220]   Just wanting to sit down, and they want to set up their Vanguard accounts and get started.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.140]   And so just being able to help them do that has been really, really cool.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:03.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.380]   Tell me about, and just a couple questions, and then we'll wrap up here.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.660]   But with the sailing, are you sure that you're going to like that?
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:10.900]   No.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.460]   No.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.340]   We could hate it.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.780]   How do you intend to test that?
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.420]   Well, that's where we're very lucky being in Florida.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.540]   We live 10 minutes away from the water.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.540]   And so we can kind of start it out by finding a good deal on a boat,
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.300]   going out, see if we like it there.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.980]   And we can head down to the Caribbean if we feel comfortable at some point,
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.340]   and kind of test the waters and see how it goes.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.740]   We actually own a sailboat, believe it or not.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.300]   It's a 16-foot Hobie Cat that we've never taken out.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.580]   Well, Mike has once, but he hadn't taken any lessons,
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.340]   and it kind of pushed him back into the public beach.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.340]   We ended up into the public beach at Siesta Key.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.780]   My friend and I had to get out and walk it back down the beach,
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.740]   and the lifeguards were screaming at us on the megaphones, "Get off the beach."
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.060]   I don't know how to get off the beach.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.420]   I have no idea how.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.620]   I told him we need lessons, and then we'll go from there.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:57.860]   Right.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.940]   So that's an example of Hobie Cats can cost $2,000 or $3,000.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.060]   I happened to find one that needed some repairs for $800.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.660]   And so, yes, we've never taken it out, but at any point, we can sell it for a profit.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.780]   And it's the same thing if we get a boat, I plan on restoring it.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.780]   And if we don't like it, we'll sell it for a profit.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.860]   And that's kind of the theme of everything we do,
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.420]   is find a way to do what you love doing and not lose money or make money doing it.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.580]   The final theme that I wanted to explore for you a moment is back to marriage.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:32.260]   The situation of one spouse starting to read Mr. Money Mustache or Early Retirement Extreme
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.100]   and getting all just fired up about, "Look, there's all these opportunities."
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.140]   And the other spouse is caught in, not caught, excuse me,
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.060]   is just simply in the normal lifestyle, not thinking about that.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.940]   It's weird in our culture.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.860]   And so this can often bring a little bit of tension in relationships
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.340]   where you get all fired up, "Look, look, let's do this."
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.180]   And many couples struggle with that.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.500]   Lauren, do you have any thoughts on things that Mike did well in talking with you
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.100]   or things that he did poorly or how it often seems to be husbands
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.820]   that do this, although I'm sure it's wives,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.740]   how a husband can effectively communicate with a wife to share a vision?
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.180]   This is something that we've discussed a lot.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.180]   We've actually talked about making a video or even a series about it,
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.780]   about how to get your spouse on board.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.180]   And I just, I think he always gave me the opportunity to,
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.780]   like I said, I often need to warm up to things and he never pushed me into it like,
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.220]   "Oh, we're starting this today."
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.940]   Or he would say, "Why don't you read some of these articles?"
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.820]   Or even he'd point me towards Mrs. Money Mustache's post,
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.900]   which was nice to see the woman's perspective and see what she had to say.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.300]   And so I think that he just let me warm up to the idea versus,
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.940]   "This is what we're doing and I've got it planned and you don't have a say."
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.580]   Do you have any comments, Mike?
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.540]   This is a really hard question to answer because you're talking about people
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.140]   who have had a relationship for, could be 10, 20 years,
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.620]   and then someone has their financial awakening.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.260]   And what if they don't ever get on board?
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.820]   What if they're never warming up to that idea?
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.220]   And I don't have a great answer to that.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.940]   And we get comments on our videos all the time.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.540]   Well, how do I find a woman who,
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:13.140]   because a lot of times they can tell that I'm the one kind of leading the discussion.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:18.020]   And I would say show before you tell.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.860]   And it would be the only advice that I would have.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.020]   That if you're going to adopt a frugal lifestyle,
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.900]   adopt it for your own if the other partner's not on board.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.580]   And then show them that you're still happy, you're still surviving,
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.620]   you're still thriving with that lifestyle.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.900]   And then hopefully they warm up to it.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.540]   And if they don't, I don't know if there's a relationship counseling at that point.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.380]   Because money is a big part of relationships.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.580]   You can't really avoid it.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.900]   It's, I wish I had better news, some bubbly answer to like,
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.900]   "Oh, it's all a bing, bong, boom, one, two, three, you do this."
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.020]   And then everybody's happy.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.820]   Yeah, I would say show before you tell.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.460]   Final words of advice.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.780]   If somebody is listening and for the first time in their life,
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.980]   they're saying, "Wow, I never even knew that was possible."
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:06.740]   What advice would you give them to build a financial, to just start down this path?
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:12.580]   I would say first start reading, start doing research, and then just try it.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.260]   Because again, what is the worst that can happen?
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.860]   You end up saving some money and you realize that that extreme way isn't quite for you.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.700]   Then you can scale things back a bit.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.740]   But just do it.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.420]   If you're considering it, why not try it?
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.940]   And I would say question everything.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.980]   And that's, we have potentially one of the ebooks that we want to write is
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.420]   question everything you know about money.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.100]   Because it seems like everything we're taught is almost completely backwards.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.140]   That car payments are a part of life.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.780]   Well, they're not.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.940]   A house is an investment.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:51.300]   Sometimes, not always, you have to go out and buy the latest and greatest to be happy.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.660]   Well, that's not true.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.860]   And if you just at least allow yourself to question everything that you've been taught,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.620]   then you can form your own opinion about it and maybe go in a different direction.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.340]   And if you form your own opinion and it's in line with society and the culture of today,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.220]   then great.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.820]   But at least give yourself a shot at a different way of looking at things.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:15.060]   If you question it and think about it, you can often reframe the decision.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:19.620]   And a lot of people look at making a certain decision, making a frugal decision as,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.660]   well, that's worse than the less frugal decision.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.940]   But if you change your frame of reference a little bit,
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.100]   my wife and I, we have a $5,000 minivan.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.460]   I don't know what it's worth now.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:34.900]   But to me, I don't want a new minivan because we love to go to the beach.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.220]   We've got two big dogs and we've got two kids.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:42.500]   And I love, I want a van that's filled with love and just joy.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.140]   So when we go to the beach, I don't want to be saying, "Oh, wash your feet up.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.180]   No, dogs get down."
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:52.180]   It's like, no, I'd rather have fur all over the car and just be dirty and salty and wet.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.860]   And okay, so the seat got wet.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.820]   Big deal.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.340]   I don't want to be fussing at my kids about the fact that the seat got wet.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:04.340]   To me, it's a benefit to have that versus, "Oh, my car is not the fanciest."
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.780]   That's funny that you bring that up because we have our Prius,
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.940]   and it was dinged up when we got it.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.220]   And the interior was well-loved and well-worn.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.780]   And when we had goats, they decided that they wanted to start jumping on our Prius.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.900]   So you'd look out in the yard and the goats would be on top of the car.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.820]   But it was sort of a, "Oh, that's fine.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.100]   It's already densed in it.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:24.580]   It's okay."
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.100]   That's a big deal.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.220]   That's awesome.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:32.820]   And then also, when you create the joy, my wife and I, the best date we ever had was
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.260]   actually Valentine's Day one day.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:40.180]   And for whatever reason, I don't remember why, I didn't want to spend much money, but I didn't.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:44.740]   So I called her and I was on my way back from something.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.500]   And I said, "Okay, get ready.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.740]   We're going to go out for a date."
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.340]   So she got dressed up for a Valentine's Day date, and I didn't have any reservations or
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.900]   anything, so I wanted to have a picnic.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.420]   So she got dressed up and we grabbed a couple of bicycles and tossed them in the car.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.780]   And we went to the grocery store, and I think I gave us a limit of either $10 or $20.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.820]   And I said, "Here's our budget for our date."
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.140]   And the whole fun was to go all around the store and try to figure out how could we get
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.500]   something fancy and fun with this very small budget.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.740]   And then we took it to the beach and we put out a towel and just ate the food.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.340]   That was the most memorable thing.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:25.140]   Far more memorable than the $250 fancy dinner where everyone else was at with the stuffed
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.180]   out restaurant.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.100]   So the frugal decision wasn't giving up anything.
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.700]   It was actually better when you reframed the decision.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.260]   Exactly.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.860]   Guys, keep doing what you're doing.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.260]   I love that you're working on YouTube and it's another medium to reach many people.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.780]   And some people, some weirdos might listen to my hour and a half shows, but many more
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.300]   people will listen to a three minute video and that can pique their interest.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.380]   So tell everyone about your channel, website, all your properties, all the things you have
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:53.860]   to offer.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:57.060]   Yes, you can find us at MikeAndLauren.com.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.180]   If you want to go straight to YouTube, you can go MikeAndLauren.tv.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.620]   That'll go straight to our YouTube channel.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.780]   MikeAndLauren on Twitter, MikeAndLaurenTV on Facebook.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.420]   And I do want to say that if any of your listeners are bloggers that are interested in getting
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.260]   involved in YouTube, please email us.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.060]   We love helping.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:19.220]   We want more financial information on YouTube because right now it is just a mess of scams
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.580]   and pyramid schemes.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:26.020]   And you look up investing for beginners and literally nine out of the top 10 are all just
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.020]   selling some pyramid scheme product.
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.340]   And we want more content on YouTube that is financial related.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.740]   So please email us and we'd love to help you out.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.940]   The email is hello@MikeAndLauren.com.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:40.820]   So I'll go ahead and just record this and I'll probably leave it in the interview for
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.620]   people to do.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.260]   But let's talk about me with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:51.060]   And you can give me some advice as being down there as far as what you would do.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.020]   I've looked at, I couldn't have done YouTube in the past.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.300]   I don't have any experience with video, any necessarily skill.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:02.820]   And I couldn't have compressed the ideas and thoughts that I have into a short version.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.380]   So I focused on audio, which was the missing piece that I saw in the marketplace.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.700]   And that's how I built Radical Personal Finance.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.900]   I feel at this point, though, that I could articulate my message and some thoughts and
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.460]   some ideas in a much shorter format.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.540]   And I'd like to start reaching some more people in the video space.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:27.300]   But the challenge is I already have such a high workload with my show.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.820]   I do the show five days a week.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.860]   I also am doing some writing.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.180]   So writing a book, also writing for other publications.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.300]   And I also have a family and I would like to do video as well.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.740]   So the question I've faced is how do I do it?
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.140]   I also don't have any computer equipment capable of editing video.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.260]   And I have cameras, I have mics, I have all of that stuff.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.100]   But I don't have the editing equipment.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.660]   I'm curious.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:57.140]   So I've thought about how could I go ahead and start this and should I do this?
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.660]   And my thought has been I could just shoot raw video.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:07.140]   And through planning, proper planning of the presentation, using some interesting visual
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:12.660]   aids with my actual presentation, just do kind of a one-shot thing, no cuts, things like that.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.700]   Do you think that's possible and that would save me from having to do all the editing time?
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.700]   Or would you say you got to hire an editor?
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.500]   - Yeah, probably not.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.860]   I would definitely edit.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.180]   We even go as far as to edit the breaths out of our videos.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:31.620]   If we take a pause or if there's just even a space in between our words, we'll cut that out.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.660]   Because people on YouTube just kind of expect it.
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.860]   A lot of the videos you'll see from the top bloggers are just very fast-paced.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.100]   - Right.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:46.180]   - And there are financial videos on YouTube from like a lot of the big corporations have,
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:50.420]   like Bank of America and have long-form financial videos.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.220]   And they seem to do well.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:57.540]   So I guess I can't say from experience that long-form one take wouldn't work.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.060]   Just in our experience, our own personal view time is three and a half minutes,
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.100]   no matter what length we make our video over time.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:09.060]   So when we initially, our average retention rate is about 80% or higher per video
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.420]   to our initial subscribers.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.460]   And then once it gets put in the suggestion engine and in search,
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.340]   people usually stick around for about three and a half minutes and that's it.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.900]   And that's been confirmed by a few different channels.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:25.140]   So I would say faster and hire the editor over trying to do it in one take.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.740]   And that takes a little pressure off for you as well.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:31.860]   - Do you think it's, is it the kind of thing that is it even worth pursuing,
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.460]   given that it's not going to be my primary focus, but I see it as more,
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.700]   well, this is a way to develop another platform, another arm to it.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.260]   Is it worth doing or should I just stay exclusively focused on what I do best?
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.660]   - I think YouTube is where we're going, honestly.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.380]   And I thought this back in 2013.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.100]   And I'm glad that we got involved when we did,
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.020]   even though we were pretty late to the game.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.980]   Most of the big channels now started around 2007, 2008.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   Just that's where all our friends are going.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.780]   And the younger generation below us, we're behind that.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.140]   They watch more YouTube than we do.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.020]   I think it's really accessible to people.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.580]   I like that there's a face behind the words.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.220]   And I like the informality of it.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.700]   And podcasting is similar, but you can be goofy on YouTube.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.980]   I would definitely recommend it.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:28.260]   And maybe one way you could start would be just filming your podcast
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.420]   and then doing clips from that.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.460]   If you wanted to do the one take with almost no effort,
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.540]   that's what Dave Ramsey does actually on his channel.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:40.100]   He'll take a call and then he'll just put one call on his YouTube channel.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.300]   That'd be a great way to start, test the waters and see.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:43.780]   - Yeah.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.860]   Well, see, I had to solve the editing issue.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.860]   And my library has big fancy Macs that I could go and use.
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.820]   But at this point, I just really questioned,
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.980]   is this the best use of my time to learn how to edit
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.860]   or do I just need to wait until I'm ready to go ahead and hire an editor
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.140]   to do it?
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.060]   And I haven't answered that question.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.340]   - For me, and I don't...
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.820]   For me, it's all in the editing.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:10.100]   Like our personalities come through through the editing process.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:10.500]   - Right, I agree.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.620]   - Because when we...
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.660]   If you were to watch our raw footage, it's 22 minutes long.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.780]   And it's us going like this.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.580]   No, I missed that.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.300]   It's us going like this.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   And then you see the, it's us going like this part,
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.260]   back to back, cutting out our breath in between the next sentence.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:29.620]   And so a lot of our, what you see on YouTube is from the editing process.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.700]   So I don't think we would ever outsource.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.380]   Maybe we would.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.900]   I would outsource the editing process.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.820]   I don't know if I would necessarily start there though.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.460]   Just so you can get an idea of what it takes.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.860]   And yes, the initial learning curve is pretty steep.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.580]   I'm not gonna lie.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.140]   You would have to put in some time to learning how to edit.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.420]   But we can now edit a video in, you know, under an hour or so.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:48.900]   - Right.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:49.940]   - Yeah, it's not too bad.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.020]   - Which it was a lot more than that to begin with.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:52.660]   - Right.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.060]   - Awesome.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:54.740]   Last question.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.060]   Do you have to get a Mac?
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.700]   - We were Mac people.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.620]   So we're pretty biased.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:06.020]   Although we have the, at work, we have the newest,
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.820]   fanciest Mac you can buy, the 12 core Mac Pro.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.140]   - Right.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.300]   - It still gets caught up in rendering.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.340]   It can't, it's not.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:17.060]   And I have seen Dave Dugdale at learning DSLR video,
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.460]   or it's just learning video now, is a big Windows guy.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.260]   He's almost tempted me to make the switch over
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.060]   just to see what kind of performance is possible.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.740]   Because you have that customization that you can do.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:26.980]   - Right.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.580]   - But as far as ease of use, if you have a Mac with Final Cut Pro,
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:33.860]   that's gonna be your easiest transition into video, I think.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:34.980]   - Awesome.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.220]   Cool.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:35.620]   Thanks guys.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:35.860]   - Thank you.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.660]   - Thanks for having us.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:41.540]   - Now, since the interview was recorded, I told you I would give you an update.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.060]   Mike and Lauren have released some new information on their YouTube channel
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.900]   that I think you would be interested in.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.940]   Number one, as they mentioned in the interview, they are expecting a baby.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:56.180]   Very interestingly, they are planning on having their baby out of the country in Costa Rica.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:00.100]   This is a form of medical tourism, which will lower the costs of having the baby,
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.180]   but also give the baby some unique options.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.220]   Go and check out their YouTube channel for information on that.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.180]   Also, interestingly, having the baby seems to have served as a catalyst in their life.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:15.540]   And instead of sitting around and waiting for all of their plan to come to fruition,
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:19.860]   they are actually using this as a time to change.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:24.020]   And they're using the foundation that they've built with their YouTube channel
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:25.700]   to actually jump a bit early.
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.500]   And instead of working on their plan of saving up just a certain dollar amount and then jumping,
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.780]   they've built enough of a platform with their YouTube audience
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.060]   that they are in the process of selling many of their things.
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.420]   They're gonna be moving to Costa Rica.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.740]   They are buying a large motorhome.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.740]   They'll be moving into that large motorhome,
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:47.060]   building a mobile wood shop to hook up and drag around the country behind that.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.340]   And they're gonna be going on the road, touring the country,
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:55.860]   filming videos, doing DIY projects with their audience while they travel the country,
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:57.780]   bringing that content to their YouTube audience,
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   and then making money from their YouTube plans, which funds their life.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.180]   And I think that is awesome.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.740]   Once they announced that, I wrote them an email and I said,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.380]   "By the way, guys, I'm so glad that you are jumping ship."
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.740]   Because what happens is there's this kind of purist mentality,
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.140]   this idea that, "Well, I've got to tell everyone that
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.340]   they can build financial independence just by working at their job,
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.780]   and so therefore I can't quit."
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.620]   Hey, if you're in a position to quit and you've got a business that you can flip to,
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.900]   do that.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:29.220]   That's gonna be a tremendously valuable thing for you.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.460]   And I encourage all of you in my listening audience,
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.780]   recognize what's going on and recognize the themes.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:39.220]   Go and watch their videos and then perhaps you'll be able to see these themes.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.500]   Recognize the theme.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.420]   The process is get control of finances, build assets.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:47.460]   They're working towards that big lump sum number and along the way,
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.980]   an opportunity comes along.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.460]   And that opportunity in their case is to build a business,
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.540]   doing something that they like to do,
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:56.500]   and that gives them the mobile freedom and the lifestyle.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:00.980]   Using the skills that they have developed, starting by doing them for free,
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.140]   the skills, the equipment while they built it up,
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:06.340]   and now it will be their full-time deal.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.260]   And they don't need millions of dollars to do it.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:11.140]   They just need enough money to buy the RV,
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.980]   have enough money and savings to make the switch,
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.660]   and to get started.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:19.300]   And that is the process of financial independence.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.580]   So I hope that Mike and Lauren's story can be encouraging,
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.060]   inspirational, and educational for you.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.300]   I think they do a really great job and I am thrilled that I was able to bring them on the show.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.180]   Go check out their YouTube channel, MikeandLauren.com.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.540]   We'll link you through to it.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.180]   MikeandLauren.com, if you sign up on their email list,
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.980]   then they will share with you all the details of their net worth,
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:41.860]   and their spending, and their income, and all of that stuff as well.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.340]   MikeandLauren.com is their stuff.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.060]   So thank you all so much for being with me on today's show.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.980]   I hope that you have enjoyed it.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.780]   A bunch of exciting shows in the work here for December.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:55.060]   I've been working on some of the outlines for the scripting of
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.860]   just some of the content and ideas I want to bring you,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.860]   and there's going to be some good ones.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.860]   So I'm going to bring you a show on budgeting,
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.220]   which I'm very excited about.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.540]   Try to lay out the framework of budgeting,
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.420]   and how it's universally applicable to every area of your life.
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.260]   So check back for that in the future.
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.100]   Big thanks to those of you who support the show on Patreon.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.060]   If you would like to support the show,
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:19.860]   go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.620]   I will be making some adjustments to that
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:25.620]   campaign here at the end of 2015 as well,
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:30.100]   but I would value your support and your financial support there.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.220]   So thank you all so much.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:32.100]   Thanks for listening.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.100]   I am out of here for today, publishing this show.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.380]   It's early on Friday morning.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.660]   I'm heading over to Tampa with my family.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.380]   Got a business meeting over in Tampa with somebody,
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.940]   and then also spending the weekend over there with friends.
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:47.380]   And in fact, I should shoot Mike and Lauren out and see if they're around.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:50.580]   One of the cool things about podcasting, you're connected with people.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.620]   So thank you for listening.
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.220]   I will be back with you soon.
