[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.400]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.160]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.000]   I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   and I'm so excited to have you here today.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.320]   Now, many of you might already know my guest today,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.480]   Gary Vaynerchuk,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.420]   but the conversation we have might surprise you.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.220]   I've known Gary for over a decade,
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.280]   and he's probably best known for his hustle
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.760]   and savvy in entrepreneurship, branding, and social media.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.640]   And while he's certainly had a ridiculous amount of success
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.320]   in those areas, building a vast empire
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.140]   that spans multiple industries,
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.400]   today, I wanna focus on a side of Gary
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.140]   that you might not have seen before,
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.920]   but having known him for so long,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.600]   I think might actually be more a part of who he is
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.920]   than anything else.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.120]   And that's a conversation about kindness,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.480]   happiness, and self-awareness.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.520]   We'll talk about ways to transform your life
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.120]   by digging deep into the importance of kindness
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.720]   and making amends with people,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.480]   how you can use self-awareness as a superpower,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.120]   some important life lessons to instill in your kids,
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.520]   and a lot more.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.280]   I'm so excited for this conversation,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   especially because it's in-person
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.760]   at Gary's office in New York.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.080]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.440]   Gary, thanks for having me here.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.280]   - Thanks for having me on your show, brother.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.060]   - Yeah, yeah, it's good to be in this office.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.080]   So many people that I told I was coming to chat with you
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.560]   associate you with hustle.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.640]   What are they getting wrong when they make that assumption?
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.100]   - The nuances of it.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880]   Like, yes, I believe in work ethic.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.440]   I think it's a variable.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.760]   It kind of reminds me of what's just going on in the world.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.120]   We're so into headline reading.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.160]   I think there was a couple of viral posts
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.600]   on Medium written about me on hustle porn
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.040]   and that kind of like cemented point of view
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.520]   that even the writer of that article,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.080]   three years later, DMed me to apologize
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160]   because he spoke to the agenda he had at hand
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.920]   and realized he was making certain variables
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920]   convenient to the story he was trying to tell.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.560]   And I really appreciated that, by the way.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.880]   I think that takes a lot of humility and courage.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360]   And honestly, I really do love the idea
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.120]   of understanding that work ethic is a variable,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.560]   but there's so many other variables.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.880]   Like, for example, from the first book I wrote, "Crush It,"
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.580]   when I wrote it in 2008 and came out in '09,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.880]   in that exact book, there's like,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.600]   hey, if you work nine to five
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.160]   and you make $48,000 a year,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.180]   you've won if you're thrilled,
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.840]   if you live within your means and you're super happy.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.640]   And so I think what people get wrong
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.800]   is I'm excited and I enjoy what I do
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.720]   and I put in hours towards it,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.120]   but it doesn't define me.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.160]   I'm completely, utterly detached
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.240]   from financial success, from notoriety.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.760]   I just love my game.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.400]   The people that know me best know
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.040]   the same vigor I talk about,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.160]   like, hey, you can have a career that you love,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.400]   I bring that same vigor to 6 a.m. on a Saturday
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.160]   to go garage sailing 'cause I love it,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.920]   or competing in basketball or pickleball
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.200]   or watching a Jets game.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.880]   What they get wrong is,
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.320]   unlike a lot of people who don't even use that word
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.820]   or even deploy that energy,
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.360]   I have tons of friends who are seemingly calm,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   speak all the right speak for acceptance,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.040]   but are absolutely, incredibly overly driven
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.840]   by money, by fame, and are detached to that,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.780]   and I think that's why there's a lot of anxiety
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.620]   in the world.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.700]   And so I think the nuances of how I think about it,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.320]   plus, I also spoke about that concept
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   during an incredibly down market in the economy
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.880]   when the internet was hitting
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.400]   an incredible inflection point in 2008, '09, '10.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.200]   When I used the word hustle in 2008, '09, '10,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.040]   the intent is like, hey, there's opportunity
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.480]   and you can go get it.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.160]   I'm thrilled to change that word to tenacity
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.200]   or grit or work ethic.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.060]   So I think the semantics of it all.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.480]   And I'm incredibly self-aware
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.280]   that the way I communicate with the excitement level,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.760]   with the energy, with the Jersey chat of it,
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.040]   I'm very aware and genuinely compassionate
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.480]   and understanding to why people may take the extreme take.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.160]   And I also don't have the audacity.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.520]   I deploy enormous humility
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.280]   when I'm about to say what I'm saying.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.260]   I would never expect someone to spend five hours
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.440]   to double click into it and actually understand
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.640]   what I'm about and what I'm saying.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.760]   And so, I guess at the end of the day,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.920]   what are they missing?
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.240]   They're not missing anything
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.560]   if they're just doing a drive-by and reading a headline.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.060]   If they've spent two or three hours on me
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.400]   through content or interaction or people that really know me,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.760]   I doubt they'd be missing anything
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.480]   'cause I think they would contextualize it.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.200]   - Do you think that work ethic you have,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.980]   that grit, that tenacity
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.240]   is something that can be taught or learned
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.580]   or is it just something that's part of your DNA?
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.880]   - I think it's a combination of both.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.960]   I think it's clearly in people's DNA.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.360]   There's many people that are either born
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.520]   with too little or too much that deploy it immediately
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.120]   to quote-unquote prove something or see an opportunity,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.280]   especially for immigrants.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   It's so easy for me to go at it.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.880]   I was born in the Soviet Union.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   My parents lived their entire childhood
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.120]   into their early 20s there.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.760]   So, I lived in a household that really understood,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.440]   like, shit, man, America's pretty epic.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.280]   This is pretty cool.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.720]   You don't go to jail for trying to make a better life
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.680]   for yourself in entrepreneurship.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.200]   So, it was very easy for me.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.320]   On the flip side, I've seen a lot of people
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.780]   be affected by the osmosis of work ethic.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.180]   It's kind of like what's going on with me in the gym.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.240]   It became so not natural.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.560]   As natural as it comes to me to sell lemonade
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.260]   or sports cards or run businesses or be nice to people,
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.280]   it comes equally not natural to me to work in the gym.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.760]   But we've known each other a long time.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.840]   Somewhere around 38, I decided to put in the work
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.040]   'cause I wanted to live longer
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.720]   and just thought it would be better.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.640]   And through osmosis practice,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.160]   like I'm now someone who goes to the gym,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.200]   I still don't love it, which is why I really do talk about
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.480]   how important passion is to actually get to that state
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.240]   where it's so easy 'cause you love it so much.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.680]   I really do wish for everyone that the job they had
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.720]   was similar to their favorite hobby.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.920]   For everybody right now who's listening,
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.720]   they can take a step back and whether it's skiing
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.800]   or cooking or playing video games or sailing
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   or garage sailing or watching movies or what have you,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.200]   if they could do that 24/7 and sustain their life,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.120]   a lot of people would be happier
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.200]   and would enjoy that.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.920]   But on the flip side, for a lot of us,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.560]   just like me for the gym,
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.200]   sometimes you have to put in that work
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.360]   if you want to accomplish something that you think is good.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.680]   To me, I'm actually very focused on people
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.280]   living within their means versus creating frameworks
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.960]   that require them to work harder, to make more money,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.200]   to live within the means that they think
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   they need to live in.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.760]   I don't think you need a BMW.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.320]   I don't think you need a six-bedroom house.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.560]   And I think that is where that conversation
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   gets interesting, but at the end of the day,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.260]   I think it is something that can be taught,
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.000]   but I don't think it's something that can be taught
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.200]   in this scenario.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.760]   I've gotten better at basketball even in the last year.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.420]   I've put in more work.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.040]   I'm not an NBA player.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.920]   So I think there is a level of DNA
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.260]   that caps out everyone in every genre,
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.680]   but I think the capacity to get better in everything
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.240]   is quite high.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.080]   I can't sing for a lick.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.840]   I have a feeling if I got a voice coach
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.280]   and really put in the work and worked on it for a decade,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.040]   I think I would be better at karaoke than I am now.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.880]   That's interesting to me, the things you can control
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.520]   versus the things that you can't.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.480]   - I'm guessing you don't wanna sing,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.440]   which is why you haven't done that,
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.200]   but you did wanna build--
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.840]   - So I have a new song out with Snoop.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.680]   Everyone go check out, it's not a joke,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.040]   go check out on Spotify.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.920]   Please take a step back, Snoop Dogg and Gary Vee.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.800]   17-year-old me is still freaking the fuck out.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.960]   - But you did wanna work out.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.800]   - Yes. - You said you're 38.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.640]   I'm 38.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.160]   I don't have a great fitness regime.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.280]   Was it just putting in the work
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.800]   or are there things you did that made it more possible?
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.480]   - I think I was also in a five-year window
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   where I was really hitting it hard,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.520]   traveling a lot, going hard.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.580]   I was really enjoying it.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.760]   I did recognize this is really not sustainable.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.040]   I don't think I have good eating habits.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.680]   I have great mental habits.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.580]   I'm incredibly calm and happy.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.920]   The hustle thing that always makes me laugh
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.800]   is I sleep six, seven, eight, nine hours a night,
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.040]   depending on the night.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.420]   So I have good sleeping, I have good lack of anxiety
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.240]   because I am detached from the work stress,
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.960]   but I knew that my eating and muscles were nowhere
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.280]   and so my back had been hurt as a child
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.640]   working in my dad's liquor store.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.200]   So that was something I wanted to fix
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.760]   'cause it was really uncomfortable
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.840]   and back to kid's life,
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.080]   you start not wanting to carry your kid
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.320]   'cause you're worried your back goes out.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.160]   The little simple things like taking luggage
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.600]   off of the top of a plane
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.400]   and having to use your right side
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.520]   'cause you're scared your left side will go out.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.840]   There was these little nagging things.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.040]   My neck would get stiff at times.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.900]   I was like, well, I'm way too young for all this
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.980]   and I plan on really quote unquote going hard.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.820]   I enjoy what I do.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.940]   I'd like to be 65 and fly somewhere for a meeting
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.860]   and so for me, I just said I've got to do this.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.700]   There's certain things that are just very clear.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.420]   Back to how we started this.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.700]   Work ethic is one of the variables
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.540]   that help somebody build something meaningful, right?
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.740]   Well, eating well and going to the gym
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.840]   genuinely gives you a higher propensity
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.240]   of having a longer life and a more enjoyable life
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.640]   in your 60s, 70s, and 80s
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.960]   so it was just a very logical conversation.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.520]   I also got to the financial place
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.720]   where I was able to hire a babysitter
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.320]   and the big unlock for me was
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.520]   I'm not accountable to myself, I'm accountable to others.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.340]   The reason I think I'm a very good boss,
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.480]   the reason I think I'm a good friend
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.520]   is I like being there for people.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.760]   For my own self, I just kind of take it for granted.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.520]   I don't want to beat my own record
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.260]   how fast I ran or how much iron I pumped
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.260]   so by hiring Mike Vacanti to be my full-time babysitter
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.480]   and the person I was accountable to,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.220]   it really worked for me
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.940]   and it's what I'm still doing 10 years later.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.100]   - It's funny, the sharp decline in my exercise
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.220]   happened when Kevin Rose stopped riding the Peloton
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.580]   because we had this fierce competition of like,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.760]   I didn't care about beating my record,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.940]   I cared about beating his record
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.340]   and he cared about beating my record
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.780]   and then he kind of gave it up
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.100]   and I lost a little bit of that edge.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.760]   - I think that's a huge insight for you.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.600]   I think you can replicate that.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.340]   You've got other Kevin Roses in your life,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.100]   you can find a Kevin Rose on Twitter right now
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.800]   and so I think that's epic
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.020]   and by the way, same with me,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.300]   like who I am on a basketball court or a tennis court,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.900]   the level of effort and work I put on in that environment
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.900]   versus what I do in the gym is like 10 to five.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.540]   Like 10 on the court, five in the gym
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.040]   so I understand that
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.760]   and I think that's something you should try to figure out.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.600]   - I got some ideas.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.300]   - By the way, anybody who's listening to this podcast,
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.700]   just hit up Chris and be like, I'll be your Kevin Rose.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.540]   - Yeah, just get on the leaderboard.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.360]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.200]   - We would basically be like,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.100]   let's push until we might throw up on this guy.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.300]   - By the way though, building this podcast,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.940]   which you have care for
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.940]   'cause you put a lot of effort to making this date work
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.180]   and I appreciate your tenacity
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.780]   and I apologize that my schedule is the worst,
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.180]   I'm so pumped we're here
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.460]   and it's always great to see you.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.760]   You're such a good dude.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.460]   I think you should build the community of this podcast.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.500]   I guarantee you 73 of your listeners right now
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.820]   are fired up right now
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.500]   and you can build a whole community on this.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.940]   - It's funny, we haven't had the conversation about this
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.260]   but we launched a membership.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260]   There's like 150 people right now actively
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.300]   starting a book club.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.020]   - Right, so in this membership, 39 of that 150
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.660]   or 150 others that haven't gotten into the membership yet
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.080]   are all about this Peloton challenge
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.740]   and something we're thinking about.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.740]   - I like it.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.260]   Okay, so first book, focus on Crush It.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.020]   Most recent book, much more on the softer skills.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.860]   - Yes.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.620]   - My takeaway was that you'd rather be known for kindness
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.580]   than hustle in the longterm, that's a focus.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.100]   Why is kindness so important to you?
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.060]   - Well, because at 47, it's clear to me
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.620]   that's an equal variable to work ethic
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.500]   that's brought me to the place that I'm at.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.700]   And the thing that I watch and admire in others
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.660]   who are in similar places,
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.100]   I think there's an incredibly disgusting concept in society
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.860]   that says nice guys finish last.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.620]   I think it's an awful thing.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.900]   As a matter of fact, I really need to make a hoodie
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.080]   and start rocking it that says nice guys finish first
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.700]   'cause I really believe that.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.580]   Because I think it's what are you judging?
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.540]   Like cool, you made $83 million in the bank and you die
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.880]   and nine people show up to your funeral was like that good?
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.520]   I would argue it's not.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.220]   And so when I wrote Crush It,
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.620]   what was obvious to me at that point
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.940]   was the internet had a huge opportunity,
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.380]   influencers were gonna be big,
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.100]   people laughed at that concept.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.300]   That work ethic was a requirement.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.340]   I was 34, all I knew was my dad and myself
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.980]   worked our faces off to build the American dream.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.040]   And that finding something you liked
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.260]   would make it not feel like work
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.060]   which would eliminate the anxiety of the work.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.420]   At 47, when I write 12 1/2,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.580]   I've now built a 2,000 person global company.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.900]   I know why it's working.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.620]   I know why it's undisputably gonna disrupt
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.800]   the marketing industry.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.200]   It's because people wanna be here forever.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.380]   I looked back at Wine Library and be like wait a minute,
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.780]   that's the same thing that happened there actually.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.420]   And then I just think about my life.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.900]   And then also I think about the hundreds of companies
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.820]   I've invested in, the ones that have worked,
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.340]   the ones that haven't,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.860]   the thousands of companies I've consultant,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.660]   the ones that work, the ones that I don't.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.300]   And I think again, back to the way this podcast started,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.740]   if you started it with Gary, nice guys finish first,
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.580]   what are people missing?
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.300]   Or if you went the other way and said hey,
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.820]   Gary, you really hate the nice guys finish last,
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.980]   what are people missing?
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.180]   It's similar to the hustle conversation,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.780]   the work ethic conversation.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.060]   There's multiple, it's why the book
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.440]   is subtitled Ingredients.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.480]   There are multiple ingredients that I think stand out
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.580]   as a consistent North Star blueprint
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.060]   that have sustainable, enjoyable success attached to them.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.340]   And I think work ethic and I think kindness
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.860]   and I think curiosity and several others
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.260]   are pretty standard.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.460]   Now some people are stronger than others
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.420]   and that's why there's so many variable differences
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.780]   of so many different things out there,
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.340]   but it works for me and I really enjoy being nice.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.180]   You know this as well 'cause you've watched this journey
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.500]   from me being someone a couple people knew
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.580]   to a lot more people know.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.620]   I've always enjoyed the fact that even today,
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.660]   the people that know me best
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.740]   have the best feelings towards me.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.940]   That's a nice feeling,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.300]   especially when you've become a public figure
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.780]   and a lot of people have a lot of different takes.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.020]   As people get closer to me, they have a better taste of me.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.340]   I'd be much happier with that than the reverse,
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.380]   which I think a lot of people in the world have,
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.620]   which is they may be liked optically on the outside,
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.540]   but as you get closer to their inner circle,
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.020]   it gets more rotten quickly.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.780]   - I wish giving financial advice were easier
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.580]   because I get asked about it all the time.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.300]   But the reality is that what's right for one person
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.180]   might not be right for someone else.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.180]   However, there are a few universal truths I believe in
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.820]   when it comes to your financial planning.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.380]   And one of them is that if you wanna protect your family
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.540]   with life insurance,
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.620]   you should absolutely be getting a term life policy,
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.380]   not whole life, universal life,
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.300]   or anything else someone is selling you.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.000]   And Fabric by Gerber Life
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.340]   has great high quality term life insurance policies,
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.140]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.960]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.660]   to help you get a high quality,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.020]   surprisingly affordable term life policy

[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.660]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.900]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.300]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.000]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.040]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.020]   It takes less than 10 minutes to apply
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.060]   and you could be offered coverage instantly
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.140]   with no health exam required.

[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.740]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.400]   not available in certain states,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.000]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.820]   Do you ever struggle with getting work done?
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.020]   It's even worse when you have to track tasks,
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.180]   write docs, and set goals in three different places
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.700]   with a graveyard of browser tabs between them.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.460]   If that sounds like you, then listen up
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.480]   because it used to sound like me.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.400]   But I'm now using the incredible tool Notion,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.100]   which makes it so much easier
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.780]   to make progress on your projects,
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.780]   and I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.980]   I basically run my whole life and business on Notion,
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.460]   and it's one of the few apps on my home screen.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.140]   I love that it's so flexible and customizable.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.020]   You can view your projects as a timeline,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.340]   a table, or even a Kanban board.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.260]   There's also powerful filtering and automation features,
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.820]   so you can work exactly the way you want.

[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.980]   which includes new powerful ways to manage projects

[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.340]   The interesting thing about kindness
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.940]   is it feels like the thing
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.660]   that most people probably think they have,
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.820]   and when you double-click,
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.820]   there's aspects of their personality.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.380]   Is cutting all negativity, does that level it up,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.740]   or how do you really own kindness?
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.540]   - I think it's understanding negativity
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.140]   versus cutting it out.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.980]   We're all humans.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.740]   I mean, I'm gonna go to the garden tonight,
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.340]   and the things I'm gonna say to Jimmy Butler
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.120]   are gonna be completely inappropriate,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.660]   though I love Jimmy Butler.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.480]   He represents so much of what I believe in.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.860]   But for those three hours, I will not be kind.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.260]   It's the context.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.820]   Every human's gonna gossip a little bit
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.540]   or talk to their best friend in the office
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.060]   about somebody else in the office.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.460]   I think the question becomes, why?
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.140]   I ask myself, why do I not spend a lot of time
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.660]   tearing down other people?
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.540]   It starts with because I'm not tearing down myself.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.060]   I don't really have a whole lot of envy.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.300]   I don't deploy a lot of jealousy.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.020]   I don't hold resentment towards my parents
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.860]   or other important figures in my life
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.220]   for anything that I deem that they did
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.380]   that wasn't good, right?
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.700]   And I think that's a very common trait for the masses.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.060]   I know people who just can't let go,
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.100]   just spend all their time on jealousy, envy, and resentment,
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.220]   and then it manifests.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.820]   It's in their subconscious.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.220]   And then like every day to day,
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.820]   if they see someone who's happy,
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.780]   they get triggered to kind of point out
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.460]   what they're not good at or what they're unhappy.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.040]   So I think we're all human and everyone has it,
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.940]   but I think getting to a place
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.620]   where you figure out your relationship with yourself,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.460]   I think can be quite powerful.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.940]   And I think always has a direct indication
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.380]   of how people feel about others.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.660]   I always believe that the bullies in the world,
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.220]   the nasties of the world,
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.780]   that not able to be civil with others of the world
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.540]   are always in a really tough spot with themselves.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.740]   - So kindness, it's funny.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.500]   We always think about kindness as like, I'm kind to people,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.460]   but it sounds like the unlock is realizing
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.700]   you need to be kind to yourself
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.220]   and you need to understand yourself.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.160]   You've said, I think self-awareness is like a superpower
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.380]   most people don't realize.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.380]   - In a way that really matters, brother.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.940]   Like, in a way that's like, man,
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.380]   if I could wish anything for people on earth
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.580]   besides good health,
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.420]   for everyone who's listening in this great community,
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.300]   'cause I know the kind that you would cultivate,
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.220]   I just think to myself, like, who's a listener of this
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.900]   based on I know good amount about you.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.380]   And like, I've been watching you for a long time.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.540]   There's like a really high standard of human on here,
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.460]   but I think a lot of them are blind to certain aspects.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.820]   And I think the biggest one is like,
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.620]   just be easier on yourself.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.220]   Like the extreme level of judgment people put on themselves
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.740]   because they play the game of comparison.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.900]   Like the enjoyment I get to see Kev or Tim Ferriss
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.580]   or anybody like Sarah Blakely.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.100]   Like, I don't know, like you, like anybody.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.420]   Like I get thrilled when I see people are winning.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.620]   As if that's coming out of mine.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.420]   I've always been baffled by people's inability
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.780]   to understand that the world is abundant
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.140]   and nobody is taking out of yours.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.820]   If 50 people showed up tomorrow
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.620]   that are incredible public speakers,
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.860]   not a dollar is taken out of my pocket.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.620]   There's plenty of speaking gigs I could do.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.220]   I really wish people understood that.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.620]   And I think understanding who you're trying to accomplish for
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.940]   is also very important.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.940]   There's a lot of people listening here
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.300]   who are still trying to make their parents proud,
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.140]   even though their parents are not capable
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.980]   of ever giving that cosign to their child
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.460]   because they themselves never got it from their parents.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.620]   So a lot of people blame their parents
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.740]   and haven't done the work of figuring out
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.820]   that they should actually be blaming their grandparents,
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.400]   which then leads them to actually realize
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.260]   they should be blaming their great-grandparents.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.780]   And it becomes this game where you can give your parents
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.900]   a lot more leeway, which actually a lot of times
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.460]   for people is an unlock.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.940]   And it's kind of like a, you know,
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.140]   you can get it off your chest
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.740]   and I'm very passionate about this subject matter.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.580]   - Are there things people that are listening can do
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.620]   to start to build better self-awareness?
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.000]   Is there like a training regimen
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.880]   or some activity that you've seen be helpful?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.820]   - I think one is to really start
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.340]   to make the people closer to them,
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.500]   feel comfortable with giving them truth and candor.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.160]   So like finding that best friend where like,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.540]   if you can go to that one place,
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.500]   whether it's your mom or dad or best friend or spouse,
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.620]   where you're like, hey, I'm actually starting a journey
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.900]   of self-awareness and I know that I've always been
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.620]   the kind of person that can get very defensive
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.540]   or it can lead to a fight or you just love me so much,
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.140]   you don't want to hurt my feelings, but no bullshit.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.420]   Can you just like answer a couple of questions for me?
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.020]   You know how everybody says like, I have all this talent.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.500]   Like, am I lazy?
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.040]   If you can get a person that loves you
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.320]   to a place where they'll tell you the truth,
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.880]   you can really start to unlock some conversations
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.140]   that can give you some affirmation
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.940]   on something you've been fighting off.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.960]   - It's funny you say this.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.640]   I remember, I hope he's okay with me talking about this.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.020]   Kevin went through this process and actually hired someone
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.060]   to call a bunch of his friends
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.620]   and have that kind of like performance review conversation
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.380]   and be like, I'm going to keep this anonymous.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.100]   I'm not going to sign it to you, but like,
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.860]   Kevin wants to know like, what can he improve in?
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.180]   Like, where is he letting his friends down?
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.020]   What would you tell him
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.340]   if you knew he wouldn't be able to know it was you?
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.460]   And it sounds like, you know,
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.980]   not everyone needs to hire someone to do that.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.200]   You could, you know, it's hard.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.700]   Sometimes your friends don't want to be honest.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.380]   - I think what you just said is a viable
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.700]   and maybe even a cleaner data set than what I'm referring to.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.540]   I'm just very aware that most people can't afford
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.660]   to hire someone to do that, right?
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.140]   Or even think of it, but like-
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.940]   - Even a friend, like ask a friend,
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.460]   can you just call these five people and ask?
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.820]   - I like it, I like it.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.180]   To your point, in my version,
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.980]   I'm asking that most inner person to give it to you.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.620]   To your point, maybe that inner person
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.860]   is the one that cultivates the data.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.940]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   - Or an anonymous Google form.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.380]   - I like that too.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.720]   I think people have to be ready, right?
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.560]   I had to be ready.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.320]   For eight years, I knew health and fitness
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.460]   was something I wanted to be,
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.320]   but it was finally on a flight from Houston to New York
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.140]   with my head against a window where I was like, it's time.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.280]   You know, for a lot of people right now,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.660]   they're hearing this and they're pushing against it,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.060]   like, nah, because they're not ready.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.300]   For another listener today, this was the moment.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   Like in the last week or two, they just got ready
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.700]   of like, you know what, I just want my life to be happier
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.020]   and this is part of the equation.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.020]   Look, out of all the things, work ethic, passion, kindness,
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.160]   I will say that accountability, I would argue,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.200]   is probably the quickest indicator to how happy you are.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.000]   If you are truly interested in being accountable.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.120]   - To yourself?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.760]   - Yeah, to the whole thing, to yourself,
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.360]   to everyone around you, to every situation,
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.800]   to every relationship, to the truth.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.120]   I'll give you a good example.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.000]   In my 20s and 30s, I would struggle so much
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.200]   with firing people and giving them canterous feedback
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.360]   that almost every exit at Wine Library
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.300]   and early VaynerMedia was sloppy.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.960]   They stayed a year longer 'cause I wrestled with it.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.140]   And then when I would do it, it would just be a shit show.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:06.140]   Like, it would be, I'd ask my cousin Bobby to do it,
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.560]   even though I was the one who interacted
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.980]   with the person every day, 500 days a year.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.520]   I would flub it, I would go in quick and get out.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.220]   I would over, I would talk for three minutes
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.700]   about how they're the greatest and be like,
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   but that being said, we're gonna have to let you go
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.620]   and they'd be confused.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.140]   And so there was two, 300 people over a 20-year period,
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.980]   back to what I said earlier, that were close to me
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.900]   and did actually know me,
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.100]   who did not have a good taste towards me.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.020]   What did I do in my 20s and early 30s?
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.140]   I would blame them.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.980]   I'd be like, how could that person be mad at me?
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.820]   They were the worst.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.340]   They were so incapable at their job.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.060]   I was such a good guy for letting them even be
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.780]   in the company for another year or two.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.620]   Look what's happened.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.140]   They've not been successful in their last two places.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.360]   And it took me getting into my late 30s
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.500]   and really actually into my mid 40s.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.720]   Fuck my late 30s, not my late 30s.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.360]   It got into the last three or four or five years
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.100]   where I was like, you know what?
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.340]   My lack of candor is the kryptonite
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.940]   to the thing I said 15 minutes earlier,
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.500]   which is I love that people that know me like me a lot.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.580]   Asterisk, people that have worked for me
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.580]   that were not good at their job in my subjective opinion
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.740]   that I let sit around 'cause I was too scared
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.020]   or was not interested in conflict.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.700]   And I created so much resentment and passive aggressiveness
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.020]   that eventually it boiled over and then they were fired.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.760]   That group of 100 to 200 people on earth
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.940]   don't have the same good taste towards me
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.460]   than the 10,000 that have been close to me in my life.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.820]   That took me being accountable to like,
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.420]   that's on me 'cause I struggled with candor,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.880]   which is why in the book,
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.460]   the last book that you're referencing,
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.500]   the reason I wrote "12 1/2" was strictly
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.580]   at the end of the day to talk about kind candor.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.980]   This concept that I rebranded it to myself
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.140]   and now I'm better at candor,
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.380]   but it took a lot of professional and personal losing
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.820]   for me to get to that point where I could be accountable
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.460]   and be like, hey, okay, tough guy,
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.380]   like you're good at a lot of shit, that's nice,
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.060]   or a lot of people, this is something you stink at
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.340]   and will continue to be a problem in your life
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.260]   unless you're able to build.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.580]   And I'm proud of where I'm at with candor now.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.820]   I'm a five, I'm a 4.7, I'm a 5.2.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.140]   It's a lot better than a one.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.740]   And I gotta tell you, in the last two, three years
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.980]   at VaynerX, the holding company, VaynerMedia,
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.500]   the agency, the company's much stronger 'cause of it.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.140]   My greatest pride as a leader was eliminating fear.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.780]   I got this, I got this, I got this.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.540]   I got you, we got this.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.340]   And I delivered for years.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.740]   But what really was rock bottom for me
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.700]   was when I realized, wait a minute,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.540]   there's a lot of people walking around scared
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.300]   'cause they don't know if out of nowhere
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.500]   they're just gonna get fired
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.580]   because I'm like, everything's great until it's not.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.080]   And I have to start giving more candor along the way
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.300]   and my organization does it better because I do it better
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.220]   and it's been a big growth for me.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.460]   - You mentioned earlier that you liked
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.700]   that that reporter reached out to you three years later.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.780]   Have you reached out to those 100 to 200 people?
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.060]   - I've reached out to many people.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.060]   I have, I like making amends.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.820]   So the answer is several.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.900]   Luckily for me, there was a lot of good
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.620]   in what happened until the end.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.780]   And so for a lot of people, when they've gone on
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.860]   to have two or three other work experiences,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.780]   they were able to contextualize what I was doing well.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.300]   And so to the credit to a lot of those people,
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.060]   a lot of those 100 to 200 people,
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.140]   two, four, five years later, have reached out to me
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.300]   because I was still on my journey, I wasn't there yet.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.660]   And then to me, when they did that,
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.660]   I would come so hard and say, hey, Jimmy, Sally, thank you,
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.800]   but hey, I need to own a piece of this as well.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.060]   Over the last two, three, four years,
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.020]   I've been better at starting that conversation
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.020]   versus being the follow-up to that.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.740]   - I appreciate you being vulnerable,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.980]   saying I'm not good at this thing
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.020]   'cause I think from the outside, everyone's like,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.500]   Gary must be great at everything.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.980]   - Yeah, and honestly, from the outside,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.820]   I think a lot of people,
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.260]   back to the way we started this podcast,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.500]   assume I'm not good at a lot of things.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.900]   For example, people are blown away
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.780]   when they hear that I don't like conflict
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.340]   because on public stages and in podcasts,
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.200]   especially 'cause I always talk about innovation
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.900]   and breaking things, seemingly, I like it.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.640]   So there's different versions.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.580]   I think the other thing for everybody who's listening
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.700]   is like, look, a very important thing, back to judgment,
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.420]   is I don't make assumptions about anybody.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.740]   Every person I know that I don't know,
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.020]   I make almost no assumptions.
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.940]   I'll give you an example of shit I think about
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.380]   when somebody's judging someone.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.100]   Like, oh, someone famous like Ryan Reynolds
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.140]   has the best life ever.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.500]   You don't know if the most important person
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.300]   in that person's life was his aunt who was a mother figure
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.980]   and she's been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.500]   How do you think that person's walking around right now?
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.020]   Or in your office, like that person got the promotion.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.900]   They're so lucky.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.740]   Are they?
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.140]   You don't know that their spouse might be dealing
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.980]   with alcoholism currently right now.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.220]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.100]   I think another thing that really works for my temperament,
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.460]   for my peace of mind, for my joy,
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.360]   is my lack of capacity to make assumptions
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.840]   about other people's lives.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.060]   Like, there's nobody I think has it great.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.900]   It's inconceivable.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.200]   Everyone's a human.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.040]   It's inevitable.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.580]   And by the way, even when someone does have it great,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.700]   and people have had, I've had 'em,
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.860]   people have had 'em eight-year, nine-year, six-year,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.740]   12-year, 20-year runs, life is too challenging.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.380]   I know friends who I know intimately
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.700]   and know well enough to say the following.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.940]   Great 10, seven, 12 years, and then boom, child sick.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.660]   Great 10, 12 years, and boom,
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.840]   father was the rock of the family, gone, heart attack.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.340]   So this concept that somebody's got a great life
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.240]   is just incredibly judgmental
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.620]   and lacks the nuances I think are required.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.540]   And I think we are at a hyperbole
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.780]   of this judgment world now.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.320]   We are full headline reading.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.920]   We are full cancel culture.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.540]   We are full assumptions.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.980]   We are full envy.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.660]   And I don't think this is a social media thing.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.860]   This is what's always happened.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.820]   We're just hearing us talk it out.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.940]   People in well-to-do neighborhoods for years
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.340]   have envied the person that's the richest
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.460]   or the handsomest husband.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.520]   People just really need to get back to being insular,
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.300]   loving themselves, just allowing them
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.700]   to start to love others.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.460]   - When you said earlier, people would be happier
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.860]   if they weren't chasing money,
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.540]   they weren't chasing dreams, they weren't chasing status.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.420]   - Dreams you should chase.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.260]   - Okay, fair.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.460]   - Like I wanna be the best surfer.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.660]   That's fun, like dreams are fun
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.400]   when you don't beat yourself up on accomplishing it,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.180]   when you champion yourself on trying to accomplish it,
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.420]   and then you being realistic about it.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.000]   - Part of that was you said people were doing what they love
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.300]   and weren't as focused on money.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.540]   They'd probably be a lot happier.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.380]   - Yes.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.220]   - I wanna spend a couple minutes on something
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.500]   that you've talked about before,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.020]   but to someone listening who's like, okay, I want that,
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.260]   I can learn to detach from the need to be as good
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.780]   as I might perceive someone to be,
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.600]   which might actually, you might be completely wrong,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.760]   on the figuring out what you should be doing front.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.220]   Have you seen people make that discovery
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   of like that's the thing that I should be doing?
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.140]   And are there things they did to get there?
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.540]   - Yes, I've seen it a lot because of what I talk about
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.460]   and how many DMs and emails I read for the last 15 years.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.540]   So far, it all happens from extremes.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.020]   Horrible divorce.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.100]   Now, whomever the wife or the husband
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.820]   is in like a financially challenged situation,
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.260]   like life's different,
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.660]   and they're forced into doing something,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.740]   and they just happen to be consuming mind
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.780]   and other positioning of like, if you're gonna do this,
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.180]   do something you like, and all of a sudden,
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.260]   they have a business making kites, this is a real one,
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.020]   and it was just really therapy
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.500]   'cause there was so much pain, and kites,
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.120]   I mean, I remember this email vividly,
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.540]   kites were a big part of their childhood and they enjoyed,
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.140]   and it was very challenging.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.340]   The father that flew kites with this person passed,
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.780]   and then six months later, divorce,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.140]   and then like really in a challenging spot,
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.100]   and this person decided to follow the passion route
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.220]   versus getting a job like everyone told him,
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.900]   and she sold kites on Etsy,
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.940]   and like four years later,
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.820]   was selling like $400,000 a year in kites,
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.880]   and so like that or the complete other side,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.220]   someone just hearing the message in the right way
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.180]   and realizing in their early 20s,
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.900]   you have nothing but capacity for risk,
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.100]   and decided to like run into it,
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.600]   and I've seen a lot of versions,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.380]   just being very humble and aware
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.900]   that they are in a financial family
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.580]   that allows them to go full risk for passion,
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.500]   just having a parachute and a landing route,
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.340]   the reverse, so pissed at their often Asian,
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.100]   or immigrant, or Indian parents,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.900]   of like I'm not gonna be a doctor or engineer,
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.060]   you fucking assholes, like I'm going for it,
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.460]   so like in extremes, I've seen in extremes,
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.500]   I'm hoping to get those edges into the middle a little more.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.460]   I'm hoping someone right now who's just like,
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.560]   to me the dream state is the person who's listening now
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.200]   that's making 210 and living a 250 lifestyle,
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.000]   they make $210,000 a year,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.260]   they live a $250,000 lifestyle,
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.300]   and they realize that if they lived a $100,000 lifestyle,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.700]   it would take the golden handcuffs off of them
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.880]   to maybe take the leap and go for it.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.580]   They're obsessed with cooking,
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.820]   and they want their own little like bakery,
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.420]   but they don't have any savings,
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.520]   'cause again, their apartment's too expensive,
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.640]   their car's too expensive,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.980]   their vacations are too expensive,
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.860]   their nights out are too expensive,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.740]   they order bagels on Seamless and Postmates,
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.060]   like do you know how many people buy $30 bagels?
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.260]   Currently, Chris, like lots, lots.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.380]   I want to not know.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.740]   - Well, but we know this,
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.080]   and this is more like the Uber thing
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.480]   that we learned years ago,
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.900]   people will pay for convenience at scale.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.900]   There are people right now who are buying $30 bagels
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.940]   and don't even realize it, right?
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.580]   They're buying an $8 bagel on Postmates or Seamless
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.660]   or Uber Eats, but then there's the surcharge,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.340]   the charge, the delivery fee,
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.740]   they kind of are blindly on the tip
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.180]   'cause they wanna be a good person.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.940]   You kind of wake up and it's a $28 bagel,
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.900]   and that same person is buying a $28 bagel
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.900]   'cause they make $210,000 a year,
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.260]   but deep down, they're like,
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.780]   they hate being in this law firm more than life,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.580]   like literally can't wait to five or six o'clock every day,
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.060]   truly can't, yet want to own a bakery,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.500]   yet wanna start a podcast on Star Trek,
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.500]   and I believe they can,
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.180]   but do they have the humility to move back in
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.340]   with their 50 or 60 or 70 or 80-year-old parents?
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.340]   Probably not.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.300]   Do they have the humility to get a roommate?
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.140]   Probably not.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.740]   Do they have the awareness to say,
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:18.900]   I should move out of New York
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.500]   and maybe move to a suburb of Wisconsin
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.260]   because I actually like the outdoors
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.700]   and my lifestyle there can afford it?
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.380]   Especially right now, I got one,
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.700]   I haven't thought about this until this exact microsecond.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.660]   We are living right now in a world
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.900]   where a lot of companies will let you work remote.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.940]   I've been talking about this whole quit your job,
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.340]   start your life by going humble.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.860]   How about don't quit your job, ask for a move,
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.060]   and so you literally go from New York, LA,
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.460]   San Francisco, Dallas,
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.500]   to literally lower cost deep suburbs of those places.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.980]   My parents live an hour and a half from this office.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.340]   Living in Hunterdon County, New Jersey,
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.860]   you can live for a lot less than living in Manhattan.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.540]   Could you do that?
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.860]   And could you take those savings,
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.820]   could you cut out the $30 bagel?
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.300]   Can you take one less vacation?
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.140]   Could you trade in the car you have now for a downgrade?
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.700]   And can you take all those savings on that 210,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.060]   now you're living a 130 lifestyle, right?
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.680]   And can you stack 30,000 savings three years in a row
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.180]   to give you that $100,000 nest egg
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.660]   to go, that's a level of practicality around passion
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.740]   that I hope becomes a bigger norm.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.580]   - Totally agree.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.060]   I actually have been thinking about this
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.460]   as you're talking that my new hypothesis is that
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.860]   once you start doing the thing that you really like,
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.020]   you actually probably will care less
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.740]   about all these other things going on, right?
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.420]   If you hate your job, like of course you're like,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.300]   oh, I need these other things to make me happy,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.940]   my friends have these things.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.700]   - It's all in, all out.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.540]   - Yeah.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.780]   - Like when I work out, I eat better.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.280]   If I don't work out in the morning, I eat worse.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.980]   So it's an all in or all out.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   When you like what you do, the majority of your life,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   aka your job, well then all of a sudden,
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.780]   you aren't spending $50 on cocktails after work
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.560]   to deal with what's going on.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.000]   You don't have seven streaming services
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.580]   to escape what's going on.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.900]   You don't find band-aids for the issue.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.300]   And the issue is your relationship and your job.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.440]   And figuring that out is massive.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.620]   - We're driving up to our vacation home tomorrow morning
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.780]   and I am so excited to spend a week relaxing in Napa,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.020]   which honestly isn't something I thought I'd ever be saying,
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.660]   but then we discovered Fractional Vacation Home Ownership
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.180]   with Picasso and actually bought one.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.860]   And I am excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.100]   So how does it work?
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.540]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.060]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.140]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.060]   and you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.760]   at 1/8 of the price.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.460]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.860]   Picasso professionally manages the home,
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.140]   handling design, cleaning, maintenance,
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.380]   bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.060]   And the scheduling system they built
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.580]   makes it fair and equitable for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.420]   When we first heard about Picasso,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.340]   we felt like they made it just for people like us.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.540]   That same week, we found the perfect place,
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.020]   toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.540]   Since then, it's truly become our second home
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.140]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.320]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.500]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.740]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.880]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.180]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.360]   So for a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.700]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.940]   where listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.460]   which means you can see new listings
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.900]   before they go on the website
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.880]   and lock in up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.840]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.760]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.320]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.220]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.320]   for this episode.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.520]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.180]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.720]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.520]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.600]   you will want to wear it all the time.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.440]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.160]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.720]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.200]   And it's not just for men.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.600]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.240]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.680]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.180]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.240]   I've ever owned.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.040]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.120]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.040]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.200]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.480]   Or I even wear their meta pants out to a nice dinner.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.400]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.720]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.460]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to

[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.340]   I got two final things.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.960]   One, let's say you're all in on something,
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.620]   which I kind of am on this podcast.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.560]   Like I found the thing that's me, it's my calling.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.520]   Once you love it so much, I know you have kids.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.620]   How do you find this balance?
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.460]   I love what I'm doing.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.300]   A part of me is like,
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.380]   I could spend every waking hour thinking about it,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.620]   but I also love this other thing.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.860]   I have these two big ambitions.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.980]   - You wanna mitigate regret.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.140]   And like anybody who has kids realizes like,
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.940]   you don't wanna wake up when they're 20
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.820]   and realize your relationship isn't strong
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.100]   and they don't wanna see you anymore.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.200]   And like, they were accustomed to living
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.540]   without you being in their lives.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.820]   And like, it's devastating.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.620]   And so I just think you're thoughtful.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.700]   Look, there's no such thing as balance.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.120]   There's your subjective opinion of balance.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.940]   I love when people like judge
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.420]   other people's work-life balance.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.300]   You don't know their family.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.040]   This goes back to a lot of things we talked about.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.220]   So I think for every person here, be willing to adapt.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.920]   I've changed and ebbed and flow multiple times
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.520]   over the last 15 years on it.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.260]   All here, this, more there, less, weekend.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.820]   I think everyone's got their own thing.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.460]   I work very hard Monday through Friday,
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.980]   but I'm pretty checked out on weekends and holidays.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.060]   And when I say pretty checked out, I'm checked out.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.860]   Unless there's a super fire.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.940]   Other people may work nine to six
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.140]   or nine to five during the week,
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.020]   but they're also working on the weekend
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.180]   on their phone the whole time.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.420]   Everyone plays it different.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.180]   And by the way, you may go all in
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.660]   for three years on this podcast
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.380]   'cause there's a moment right now.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.980]   But then in three years, you may be like,
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.660]   wait a minute, I've done that.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.860]   But like, look over here,
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.060]   these little ones are getting big.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.460]   And like, wait a minute, I'm worried.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.540]   And so you can go all in there.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.020]   Like, people can find balance in extremes.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.860]   You can't judge yourself on a day-to-day basis
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.980]   on these big issues.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.340]   It's a bigger thing than that.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.740]   Look at all the people that reconcile
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.260]   with their relationships years later
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.180]   and have great, I mean, I have a friend
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.900]   who didn't speak to their father for 40 years
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.460]   and now has had an incredible five years.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.380]   And that's because they've leaned into forgiveness.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.580]   I think it starts with forgiving yourself.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.720]   You know, back to your question,
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.980]   like, there's a lot of parents right now
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.220]   who have 17-year-olds who are like, oh, too late.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.660]   No, not too late.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.940]   There's never a bad day to start doing the right thing.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.380]   Like, if you're 62 and you've never been good
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.140]   at health and wellness, good news.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.660]   Tomorrow is a good idea to do it.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.260]   If you have 18-year-old twins
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.860]   and you've worked on just your career
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.340]   for the last 18 years,
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.040]   and you can sense they're about to go to college
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.800]   and they don't give a shit about you.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.100]   They love you, but they're accustomed
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.540]   to not having you be a big part of their lives, good news.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.420]   You could visit them every weekend at college.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.480]   Probably a bad idea.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.620]   They might not like that.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.060]   But like, you could start today to put it in,
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.200]   if you are angry at your mother
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.820]   and you've got 20 years of resentment built up,
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.980]   like, good news.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.660]   Today is the day you can start therapy.
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.720]   Today is the day you can go have a canterous conversation
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.020]   that is built on compassion for your mom
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.620]   that gets some of the poison out.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.220]   There is never a bad day to start doing the right things
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.580]   that are most upsetting you.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.400]   - I love it.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.660]   The last thing, kids, everyone listening
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.720]   could share this with their parents.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.860]   They could share it with their spouse.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.980]   They could start to think about these lessons.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.020]   I can't go share this with a one, a three-year-old,
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.420]   probably not a five, six, seven-year-old.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.740]   Are there things you're doing to try to instill,
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.820]   let's take your kind of 12 and a half lessons.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.740]   - Self-esteem.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.460]   - That's the thing.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.460]   - That's the thing, and not delusional self-esteem.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.360]   - Okay.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.420]   - If your seven-year-old loves Beyonce,
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.760]   but when she's running around the house singing,
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.220]   like, literally, you have to put earplugs in
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.700]   'cause it's the worst sound you've ever heard,
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.740]   it's probably a bad idea to tell her
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.300]   she can be Beyonce one day, too.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.460]   It's not a bad idea to say if she puts in a lot of work,
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.140]   she could be better at singing than she is today.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.060]   So, to me, it's self-esteem.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.240]   Also, what do you compliment your kids on?
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.180]   If you're complimenting your kids constantly
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.660]   on how attractive they are,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.520]   you're so beautiful, you're so cute, you're so handsome,
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.620]   you're instilling affirmation on that,
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.620]   which is gonna affect them when they're in their 30s,
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.780]   40s, 50s, and 60s 'cause that's gonna be their self-worth.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.820]   If you're telling them that they're remarkable
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   because they're getting A's in school,
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   you're teaching them to conform to systems
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.780]   that aren't real once they become 22.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.340]   Might not be the best idea.
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.160]   Eighth place trophies bother me,
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.740]   not because I'm so competitive,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.020]   but because you're telling your kids that losing is bad.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.780]   Like, kids are smart, kids are smart.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.020]   So they realize the reason they're getting
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.000]   an eighth place trophy is like you, as the parent,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.960]   don't want them to feel losing.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.420]   Losing is bad.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:52.500]   The problem is losing is such a fundamental part of life
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.960]   that you're teaching kids to be scared of it
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.420]   instead of leaning into it.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.860]   So for me, it's practical self-esteem, truth.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.820]   - What do you compliment your kids on?
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.000]   - Their humanity.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.660]   Whenever I see them interact with humans
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.180]   and are kind, compassionate, empathetic,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.860]   when my son will go over to somebody who gets hurt,
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.300]   I mean, he drilled a line drive
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.900]   when coaches were pitching two years ago when he was eight.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.340]   He drilled, he was very good at baseball
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.340]   between like six and 10.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.020]   Drilled a line drive that drilled the head coach.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.260]   He ran, you know, he hit it,
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.540]   so he started running towards first base
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.020]   and he stopped in the middle of the base path
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.480]   and asked the head coach if he was okay.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.700]   You know, after the game, the coach came up to him,
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.500]   he's like, look, I've been hit a lot of times
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.380]   in the history, he's been doing it for 30 years,
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.060]   he's like, I've never had a kid just stop and do that.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.900]   And I bring that up to my son every day.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.900]   Like, do you know how good of a person you are?
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.980]   Even though you're so competitive
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.820]   in baseball as your passion, like you did that.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.220]   The humanity of it versus the thing.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.580]   So I try to focus on those things.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.620]   - I love it.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.040]   I feel like this is not the conversation
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.740]   I think a lot of people thought we were gonna have
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.860]   and I like that.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.600]   Any final words or where people should go to see more Gary?
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.460]   - You know, I think building off of what you just said,
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.460]   it was a theme of everything.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.380]   Like, books by covers is a real issue
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.980]   in our society right now.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.060]   For me, to your point,
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.040]   I think 90% of your audience will be like,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.140]   oh, that was interesting, didn't see that going that way.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.700]   I think for 10% of your audience,
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.700]   when you just said that, they're like,
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.500]   what are you talking about, Chris, that is Gary.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.700]   Why, because they've allocated the time to go deeper.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.140]   We are really in it in our society right now,
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:35.060]   politically, socially, nationalism, geopolitically.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.380]   There's a lot going on.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.860]   And we're also affected by the last 30 years of parenting
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.340]   where I do think we over swung too far in certain areas
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.820]   like eighth place trophies,
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.140]   which has made a lot of people anxious.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.940]   So what I would say as a final thought is,
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.100]   if you find yourself thinking that in this interview
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.020]   or any other of Chris's interviews,
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.220]   it's definitely what made me think about the world.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.660]   Like, when I started going through my 20s and 30s
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.540]   and meeting people that I had different thoughts of,
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.740]   and then when I got to double click in,
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.820]   either in person or through content consumption,
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.420]   I'm like, ah, right.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.140]   You know, that will lead to a much happier life.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.900]   But like the theme of this whole podcast,
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.980]   it starts with yourself.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.780]   Finding how to not judge yourself for your shortcomings
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.060]   and accept yourself for your shortcomings
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.980]   and champion and be proud of your strengths
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.220]   is a really nice framework to be able to do it for others,
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.860]   especially your children, your spouse, your parents,
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.620]   and then going to your friends and acquaintances,
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.380]   and then just the world.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.060]   I think this world desperately needs
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.260]   more civility and warmth.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.500]   And I think people are looking for others to provide it.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.260]   And I think back to accountability,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.100]   it starts with yourself.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.300]   And so I think you're capable of it.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.100]   I really do, whether that's therapy
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.220]   or listening to different things
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.860]   or starting a regimen of health or wellness
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.900]   or mindset that gets you to that place.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.820]   And I think you should do that
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.980]   'cause it's a lot more fun to live life happy
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.660]   because final thought, you were dead for a long time,
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.780]   aka not born, and you will be dead forever.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.340]   And so I think it's a good idea
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.460]   to maximize your hundred years, God willing.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.540]   So consider that.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.380]   - I love it.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.620]   Reach out if this was helpful.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.900]   I'm sure they can reach out to you online.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.740]   - Of course, I'm easy.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.980]   - Gary's easy to find on the internet.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.380]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.220]   - Thank you.

[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.780]   (bubbles popping)
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.780]   (crickets chirping)
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.780]   (crickets chirping)
