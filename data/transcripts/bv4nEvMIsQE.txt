[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   the core idea is there is mobility upward that's generally true at least in u.s society over the
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.420]   period i talked about i think that's probably going to be true in the future even though yes
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.020]   it's been a little bit slower recently i think gen z millennials gen gen alpha all these people
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.440]   like it's been tougher on them than prior generations like for a host of reasons i think
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.660]   housing prices is one of those big determinants that's slowing that down but we're going to see
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.600]   this change over time as the boomers pass on and stuff all that wealth is going to start moving back
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.560]   into the next generation etc i'm hopeful i think we just have to wait it out i think just the median
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.480]   the first time home buyer age is going to go up like we're just going to delay what we normally
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.300]   would have done earlier in life that's all
