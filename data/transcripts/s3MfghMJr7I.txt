[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.600]   - Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing podcast number 25.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.800]   Today my special guest is Don Phillips, former CEO and a managing director of Morningstar.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.280]   Over the last 35 years, Don has had a front seat watching and commenting on the many changes
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:38.920]   that have occurred in the mutual fund and advisor industries.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.400]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry and I'm the host of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.000]   This podcast, as with all podcasts, is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.080]   Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that can be found at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.400]   Today our special guest is Don Phillips.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.800]   Don is a former CEO of Morningstar and a managing director who remains involved with corporate
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.560]   strategy and investment research.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.240]   Don joined Morningstar in 1986 as the company's first mutual fund analyst and soon became
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.840]   the editor of its flagship publication, Morningstar Mutual Funds.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.360]   He established an editorial voice for the company, and under his leadership, the company
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.000]   developed Morningstar style boxes, a Morningstar rating system, and many analysis techniques
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.140]   that are stable in the mutual fund industry today.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.440]   This podcast is a fast-moving discussion about many topics of interest in the mutual fund,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.080]   ETF, and advisor industries, and we even touch on federal reserve policy and cybersecurity.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.800]   So fasten your seatbelts, here we go.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.320]   I'm delighted to have with us today Don Phillips.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.960]   Welcome to the podcast, Don.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.640]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.160]   Don, you have quite an interesting history.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.000]   You joined Morningstar back in 1986 as the first mutual fund analyst, and ironically,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.800]   I was just getting into the business around that time.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.600]   Can you tell us a little bit about your background?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.040]   I had started investing back when I was a teenager.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.120]   My dad bought me 100 shares of the Templeton Growth Fund for Christmas one year, and then
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.280]   he sat me down on Friday night when Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser was on, and John
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   Templeton was the guest host.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   And I was just so impressed.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.240]   It's like, here I am, this little paper boy, and here's my personal money manager on national
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   television.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   And it just really was amazing to me.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It just sort of opened up a world for me, and for a long time, I thought of Templeton
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   as a role model.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.760]   And I think it was only later in life that I realized that the real role model was my
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   father.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.400]   And it was for me that investing was something that he did as a responsible adult, and it
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.080]   was something that I could do.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.520]   So I had an early introduction to funds, and really thought it was a sensible way to invest.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.280]   I studied economics at college and completed all my coursework in economics, but then switched
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   over to English literature and was pursuing a master's degree in literature at the University
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   of Chicago when I decided to sort of flip things around.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.680]   I was thinking that I'd become a college professor, but be an active investor on the side.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.920]   And I decided to flip that around and say, "Well, why don't I get a job writing about
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.160]   researching investments, hopefully mutual funds, and then read the great books on the
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   side?"
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.040]   And Joe Mancedo ran an ad in the Chicago Tribune that said, "Wanted Mutual Fund Writer."
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.760]   And I sent him an impassioned letter saying, "This is exactly what I want to do with my
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   career."
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.000]   We came in and talked for an hour about John Templeton, and two days later, he called up
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and offered me the job.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.320]   >>Corey: Now, if I recall a story about Joe doing mutual fund analysis at his kitchen
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.240]   table, is that-
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.600]   >>Steven: I joined Morningstar after Joe had moved out of the apartment, so I never had
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.360]   to deal with the dirty socks on the floor, things like that.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.920]   He was in the Monadnack building in Chicago, had just sort of moved in there.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   But he'd started the company in '84, so he'd been around for about 18 months to two years
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   before I joined.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.880]   And he was already putting out the Mutual Fund Sourcebook, which had a tremendous amount
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.760]   of mutual fund data in it.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   It had holdings.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.080]   It only covered equity funds.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.720]   He wasn't quite sure how it was going to cover bond funds at the time, and it didn't have
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.560]   any analysis of the individual funds, but it did have the star rating.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.360]   Now, that predates me.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.680]   But I was hired for a second publication that Joe wanted to do, and it's the one that you
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   are probably more familiar with, and it had the one-page reviews of funds.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.960]   It had a lot of data and graphs-
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   >>Corey: Right.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Right.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   Right.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   >>Steven: And I was hired to write that text, to sort of interpret the data, to call up
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.800]   fund managers, to get additional information, and to give an investor kind of a fuller picture
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.960]   of what they needed to know about that fund to decide if it was appropriate for them or
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   not.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.360]   >>Corey: I recall the first job I had in the industry, I was working at Kidder Peabody,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.400]   and we used to begin to get these paper editions of Morningstar printed on newspaper-type print,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.800]   and they were fascinating to go through them.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.440]   There was such great information.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   Eventually, this continued to grow, and at one point along the way, you got to meet Jack
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   Bogle.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.840]   Can you talk about your relationship with Jack?
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.360]   >>Steven: Well, Jack became an early and ardent supporter of Morningstar, and he was talking
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.400]   about it in the press before I ever met him.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.440]   I remember one early quote he said, something along the lines of, "I bow to no man in my
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   respect for Morningstar," and I think what he realized early on is that we were coming
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.680]   at investing from the same point of view that he did, and that we believed if the investor
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.920]   doesn't win in the long run, everyone else in the process has failed.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.240]   It all has to be about investor success and helping people meet their goals.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.440]   It's not just about making a lot of profits for the asset management company or for the
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.920]   person selling the funds.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920]   It's about the investor.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.200]   I think Jack also realized that we were shining a light on the playing field, and that the
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.560]   more it became a clear, well-lit, even playing field, the more the cost advantages that he
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.840]   had at Vanguard and the superior investment product would win out over time.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.080]   He was a big early supporter of ours, and I've always appreciated that, but it's simply
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.680]   because we had philosophically the same mindset about doing what's right for investors.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.640]   >>So you had to review all these active funds.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   That was your first job, and write about them, and really get into the nitty-gritty detail.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.600]   You were truly a mutual fund analyst, and probably one of the first ones out there,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.440]   but you eventually started to have an affinity for index funds.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.880]   Can you talk about how that "aha" moment occurred?
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.760]   >>Well, I don't know that it was an "aha" moment.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.600]   We were always just looking for things that are good for investors.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.800]   Index funds clearly were good for investors.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.360]   It's broad-based diversification, low cost.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.520]   I should back up and say maybe what Jack Bogle would call a traditional index fund is good
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   for investors.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.440]   Later on, we saw some bad behavior under the index tent.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.440]   >>Absolutely.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   >>At one point, there were scores of index funds that had turnover ratios of more than
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.000]   100% a year, or expense ratios of more than 1% a year.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.320]   As Jack Bogle would say, the whole case for indexing falls apart if it's not prefaced
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.400]   by the words "low cost" and "low turnover."
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.120]   They were broad market indexing.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.800]   Indexing just became more and more compelling, interestingly, as active management became
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   better.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.000]   That's sort of the paradoxical part about it.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.880]   For one segment of the market players to better the averages, you've got to have some other
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.720]   group of participants who are underperforming.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.680]   For years, those underperforming participants that allowed active managers to be above average
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.840]   were the individual investors, or the shoot-from-the-hip stockbrokers who were advising individual
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   investors.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.400]   These individual investors going out trying to play the market oftentimes had very poor
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.840]   results.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.000]   You may recall back then, they used to talk about this thing they called the "odd lot
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   theory."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   >>Oh, yeah.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.320]   >>That meant when the volume of small trades, odd lots being buying securities in less than
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.280]   100 share blocks, when the volume of that went up, it meant that individual investors
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.920]   were piling in the market, and that was a sign of a market top.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.440]   For a long time, you did get superior performance among active managers because you had this
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   underperforming group of individuals.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.360]   What happened over time is those individuals got smarter.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.560]   They said, "Hey, we're tired of being the suckers here.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.240]   We're not going to buy individual stocks.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.200]   We're going to start buying funds."
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.720]   Now all of a sudden, it was only professionals who were really dominating the market.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.600]   Even in the early days, you still had a lot of mutual funds, active managers who regularly
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.700]   outperformed the market.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.040]   It seems to me, and you can't prove this, but where that advantage went away was when
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.120]   regulation fair disclosure went out.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.640]   No longer did the big East Coast shops get first crack at corporate management or maybe
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   get little insights.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.120]   Once it came out that corporations had to give information out to all participants at
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.600]   the same time, that sort of structural advantage and superior performance that you saw from
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   some big East Coast shops year after year after year started to go away.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.480]   Then you also saw as more money went into mutual funds is that across the board, the
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.720]   caliber of the asset management went up.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   I think the CFA program had a huge amount to do with this in that it started educating
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   more people.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.000]   Analysts, even at small fund shops, became very sophisticated and much better at what
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   they were doing.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.520]   More importantly, maybe they were also being trained in the same methodology.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.600]   Now, all of a sudden, when you've got the market dominated by professionals who have
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.400]   access to the same information and are using the same mindset to analyze securities, active
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.200]   management became more and more homogenous.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   In my mind, that's what really set up the stage for the rise of passive investing because
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.240]   passive investing is simply about keeping your costs down, keeping your transaction
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.400]   costs down, keeping your expense ratios down.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.760]   When you're looking at a homogenous group, it's the low cost provider that's going to
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.680]   be the winner there.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.560]   The great irony is that passive has succeeded largely because active got better.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.520]   >> I went through the CFA program and it's true that it was a very good program.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.640]   It produced a lot of good analysts and money managers who were all basically doing it the
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   same way.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.400]   >> Before, you had really big shops which had training programs and their analysts all
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.720]   became maybe the equivalent of today's CFAs, but then you had a lot of mom and pop shops
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.480]   and people forget what a cottage industry, the fund industry was 20, 30 years ago.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.040]   There were all of these small shops and maybe their main stock picker, maybe someone just
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.240]   with drawing out little hand charts and going to the newspaper every day and writing down
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.540]   prices and then trying to do head and shoulder diagrams or something like that.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:47.300]   It was not nearly as sophisticated an industry 30 years ago that it is today.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.640]   It was as the industry grew in sophistication and became more homogenous that the case for
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.280]   indexing became even more compelling because it was harder to find consistently superior
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.320]   managers because that pocket of underperformers started to be chipped away at.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.140]   >> Interesting that you talk about the odd lot trend line and such where the number of
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.960]   odd lots going up, therefore more speculators in the market, that it signals in some way
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.400]   a market top.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.300]   I recall the number of day traders in the 1990s who you ran into them and they were
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.240]   quitting their day job to become day traders and we were all saying, "This has got to be
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   near a market top."
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.280]   Well, I know it's funny, but you know what, I'm seeing that right now, seeing it right
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   now.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.120]   You've got these Robin Hood traders, you've got people who I see on Twitter who just are
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.200]   absolutely convinced that they can outperform the market.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.840]   I see the same thing that I saw back in the 1990s, the same attitudes, maybe a different
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.320]   group of people, a different generation, but it's the same thing.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.080]   We have the rise of the day traders, if you will, supposedly using more sophisticated
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:00.200]   technology or whatever, but could this possibly be a signal that we're reaching a long-term
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   market top?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.160]   Those are questions well worth asking.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.960]   The nice thing, though, is that you do see what's oftentimes termed as the behavior gap,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.800]   the difference between the time-weighted returns and the dollar-weighted returns.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.960]   It's starting to really shrink and I think a big reason it's shrinking is that more investors
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.840]   or a higher percentage of investors are becoming buy-and-hold index investors or they're using
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:32.080]   more sophisticated, longer-term asset allocation plans as opposed to market timing and trying
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.440]   to jump in and out of the market.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.120]   The more you just buy-and-hold the market, the more you're going to enhance your returns
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.640]   over time and the more you're going to get rid of that behavior gap because if you just
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.360]   buy-and-hold, your dollar-weighted return becomes essentially the same as your time-weighted
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.080]   return over time.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.600]   I think we are seeing on the whole, through things like 401(k) plans, the great success
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.360]   of independent advisors out there helping people make better investment decisions, we're
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.680]   seeing on the whole, I think, massive improvement in the average investor's experience.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:12.760]   Your comments about the investor gap shrinking, the performance gap shrinking, your own data
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:20.360]   at Morningstar shows that people who have been in balanced funds and target date funds
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.240]   or life strategy funds where the rebalancing is done automatically for them is actually
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.560]   a positive performance gap.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   Absolutely.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.800]   I mean, you could actually use the bad investor behavior of others against them if you're
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   a bit of a contrarian.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.920]   So, in a balanced fund where you're reestablishing the balance, stocks go up, you sell them and
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.560]   you buy more bonds, you're constantly reestablishing that balance and you're going against the
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.920]   fear and greed emotions that investors have.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.120]   That to me is the central investment question.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.920]   We know that investors are driven by fear and greed, they have this manic cycle.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.960]   I think the question all of us in and around the asset management industry have to ask
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.840]   ourselves is are we going to be a part of accelerating that fear and greed cycle, out
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.320]   promoting hot products at their peaks and then yelling run for the hills at the troughs?
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.920]   Or are we going to be a part of trying to calm down that cycle and help investors ride
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.040]   this out?
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.920]   And the nice thing is that things, as you mentioned, like balanced funds or target date
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.000]   funds, and anyone working with a good financial advisor is going to get a sophisticated, balanced
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.480]   portfolio based on good, strong asset allocation principles today, all of which are much more
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.840]   likely to lead to a better result.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.680]   It's certainly better than calling up your broker 30 years ago and saying, "Hey, what's
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   this week's hot tip?"
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.200]   Well I look at advised client portfolios every day as my business.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.800]   Now I'm doing an hourly business and so I don't have any skin in the game anymore, I'm
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.680]   not managing money, but I do get to look at portfolios every day and many of them are
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.680]   from advisors.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.840]   And yes, there's a subset that does it right, but there's also a subset that is all over
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   the place.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.200]   That's a very fair point.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.080]   I wrote a commentary once called "The Third Rail," the thing that no one in and around
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.160]   financial services want to say, and that's that lots of people like to say, "Look how
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.920]   much the average investor underperforms the broad market," but the thing that they never
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.840]   throw in is that the average investor today is using an advisor, because most individuals
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.440]   use some kind of advice or they use something in like a 401(k) plan where there's someone
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   who has a fiduciary responsibility.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.760]   And so if you put those two things together, that the average investor is doing poorly
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   and the average investor is working with an advisor, it means that there must be an awful
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.600]   lot of bad advice out there.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.080]   And at one point there was more bad advice than good, I would argue.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.280]   If you turn back the days when the wire houses sort of, their mutual funds were the biggest
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.400]   in the industry and they were some of the worst performers.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.280]   But increasingly today assets flow to the better funds and increasingly people are deploying
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.160]   them more successfully and they're holding them for longer periods.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.840]   They're not just trying to jump in and out.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.000]   And so I tend to be an optimist and say, "On the whole, things are trending in the right
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.200]   direction," but I would agree with you wholeheartedly and say that we're not at that point where
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.120]   everyone's having a great experience and that there aren't still bad actors out there.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.960]   You know, a lot of times we point to fees as the reason why active management underperforms
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:18.680]   indexing, and then we can look at fees for active management coming down pretty substantially
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.040]   over the past 20 years.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.840]   The fees for indexing and index funds and passive, the traditional ones as you spoke
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.800]   about, are also coming down.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.320]   But the irony is of the data that I look at, even though active management fees have come
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.560]   down quite a bit and traditional index fees have come down some, they were already low
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.040]   to begin with and they came down some more.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.760]   The number of active managers that are underperforming the indexes is still the same amount.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.220]   It hasn't come down.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:54.800]   So there's something else going on there and I think the fact is active management is just
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.560]   getting tougher and tougher and tougher, as you pointed to earlier, with the quality of
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.080]   active managers that are out there.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   It's absolutely true.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.880]   Another thing is that it's been the biggest companies that just keep getting bigger and
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.920]   bigger that are what's driving the market.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.400]   Look what's happened with the FAANG stocks recently.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.480]   And you think about this, an active manager might easily have three times the market weight
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.800]   in a small cap stock, but they're never going to have three times the market weight in Amazon.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.120]   You'd have to put a double digit amount of your portfolio into that one stock and no
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.680]   one ever does that.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.000]   And so active management tends to do better on a relative basis in small cap led markets
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.880]   than they do in large cap led.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.440]   And certainly the kind of markets, it's an environment we've been in the last two decades
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:45.800]   where the biggest keep getting bigger is one that is not advantageous to active management.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.040]   And active management, as you point out, doesn't need that disadvantage because it's already
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:56.920]   at a crippling disadvantage due to cost, especially if you include taxes in cost, which can just
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:02.000]   completely decimate the case for active management when you take into account the tax consequences
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.040]   of their actions.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.860]   This is a really good segue into style boxes because you mentioned that the average active
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:14.760]   manager more equal weights their portfolio than market weights their portfolio.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.080]   Therefore they are going to have a higher probability of having more weight towards
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.360]   mid cap and small cap individual names than say the market would.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.980]   However, years ago you created Morningstar style boxes, which captured this and put these
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:37.400]   managers in the right boxes, or at least attempted to put the active managers as closest as you
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.000]   could into the right boxes to try to give you a more apples to apples comparison.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.760]   So tell us about the whole evolution of the style boxes.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.520]   Well, it came from attending a financial planners conference and advisors were sitting around
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.120]   the table saying, how do I explain to my client why we have more than one US equity fund in
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   their portfolio?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.660]   They said the client would say, look, we've already got this one equity fund.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.200]   Why do we need another general equity fund?
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.000]   Let's add a gold fund or let's add a sector technology fund.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.520]   And the advisors were saying, gee, I could see adding a gold fund or a tech fund, but
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.440]   that should be the seventh or eighth fund we add, not the second.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.000]   How do we explain to an investor that two US equity funds might be complementary to
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.060]   each other and another two might be overlapping and that the two I'm suggesting actually complement
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   each other and aren't doing the same thing and so it's actually bringing diversification.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.980]   And what we really want to do is give the investor control over the analysis of their
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.980]   funds.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.920]   And back then, some of our rivals in the fund tracking business, they basically just let
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.180]   fund companies pick their category.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.060]   If they called it a growth and income fund, it went into the growth and income category.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.300]   And yet, their definition of growth and income might be very different from someone else's.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.020]   And we wanted to police that to a certain extent.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.340]   And we also wanted to get rid of what I call sort of the inside baseball talk.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.580]   Back then, you had to be an insider to know that Windsor meant large cap value stocks,
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:05.100]   that that was John Neff's strategy, and that Janus meant large cap growth.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.500]   If you were an insider and you knew those things were great, but there was nothing about
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.380]   the name Windsor or Janus that gave you a clue how they were going to invest that money.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.060]   And what we wanted to do was just create more apples to apples comparisons so an investor
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:21.820]   could understand, could make better comparisons between funds and could understand perhaps
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:27.460]   what role in a portfolio or what part of the economy or the economic opportunities a certain
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.260]   manager was mining in, and to set more realistic expectations.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.780]   You know, to expect Windsor to outperform in a growth-led market would be foolish.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.820]   And yet, if you didn't have that understanding that Windsor really bought value-oriented
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.340]   stocks and it had headwinds and tailwinds that were different than Janus, you would
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.140]   end up consistently selling Windsor at the time you should be adding to it and buying
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.260]   Janus at the time you should be selling it.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.980]   So we just wanted it to be descriptive and to help people and advisors get on the same
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.780]   page and better understand and set more reasonable expectations for the funds that they were
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.780]   holding.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:05.740]   >> About this time, 1994, Gene Fama and Ken French came out with their first section of
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:13.220]   return paper which talked about the three-factor model, beta, size, value, which was measured
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.120]   by them by book-to-market.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.440]   How much did this influence Morningstar's decision to go with a Morningstar style box
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.260]   and how much did that work in?
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.220]   I know that your value is not book-to-market.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.140]   You have a multi-factor approach to value and growth, but could you explain the academic
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.140]   side to it?
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.940]   >> Well, initially, the way we looked at value was just price-to-earnings and price-to-book.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.920]   It was just those two added together, you know, the relative position and then averaged.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   I think it was a nice correlation.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.620]   I mean, obviously, we were doing this before they were doing it, but it was already, there
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.380]   was circulation out there and you did have a handful of managers positioning themselves
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.460]   as small-cap value and some as large-cap growth.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.100]   But most of the things that were small-cap were on the growth side.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.280]   There used to be a small-cap category and an aggressive growth category and they tended
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.260]   to have an awful lot of gray area between them.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:10.100]   So I think, you know, the academic backup of this thing that, look, size and style are
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.980]   something that has predicted value and are important differentiations.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.500]   I think that maybe encouraged more fund companies to pay attention to this.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.660]   And then the style box also gave, you know, this sort of the unintended consequence of
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.820]   the style box is it gave fund companies a roadmap on what kinds of products that they
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.820]   could develop.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.040]   Because right now, you know, they could say, we could look at this nine-box grid and say,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.420]   we've got funds that map into three of these, so now what we have to do is go out and create
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   the other six.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.100]   And, you know, that was never our intention.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.020]   We didn't design the style box to be a marketing roadmap for product creation.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:48.980]   We did it for these much more pedestrian intentions of trying to just help investors understand
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.340]   what a manager was doing and to understand that over time a manager's style might change.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.900]   You know, someone who starts out buying small-cap stocks, as the fund gets bigger and bigger,
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.920]   might migrate more into mid-cap or large-cap territory.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.860]   Or you could have a portfolio manager leave.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.540]   You know, the fund's name would stay the same, but perhaps the last investor was a diehard
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.300]   growth investor and the new investor is much more value-oriented.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.860]   You know, back in the days when fund companies just, or funds just had these poetic names,
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.700]   you saw those kinds of massive shifts in strategies that would go on with the investors not, you
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.340]   know, not at all being aware that they suddenly had a very different portfolio.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.780]   >>COREY: Oh, like the Fidelity Magellan fund.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.940]   >>STEVE: There was a, when we first started doing this, there were two funds called Blue
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.780]   Chip Growth, I think.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.780]   One was from T. Rowe Price and the other was from Fidelity.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.220]   And T. Rowe has always been a real truth in labeling shop, and so if they call something
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.340]   Blue Chip Growth, it's going to be what you and I would, and your clients would think
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.140]   of as being, you know, Blue Chip, you know, large-cap stocks.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.580]   And I remember we looked at, like, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, and I think it's median
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.260]   market cap, where you placed it just barely in the mid-cap, just out of the small-cap.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.420]   And I remember talking to the fund manager, and he said, "Well, I guess if pressed, I
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.460]   would have to say that I think of these as future Blue Chips."
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.960]   I said, "Well, that's great, but you're telling the world that this is a Blue Chip fund.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.140]   They think their expectation of what they're getting is completely different from what
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.020]   your expectation is in running the fund."
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.740]   And when you have that mismatch of intention and expectation, investors tend to suffer,
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.820]   and I think the industry lets down its clients.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.580]   >>COREY: And actually, the SEC finally stepped in on that, and was sort of a truth in labeling
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.820]   regulation that came out to ensure that if you said your fund had Blue Chip stocks in
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.180]   it, it had better at least 80% have Blue Chip stocks.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.260]   >>GREGORY: Yeah, it's true, but it gets a little nebulous when someone's like, "Well,
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   how do you define a Blue Chip?"
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.660]   There isn't some, you know, God-given stamp that said, "This is a Blue Chip, and this
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.660]   isn't."
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.660]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.660]   And there was a classic example.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.460]   Again, I think it was a Fidelity fund.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.940]   They had an insured municipal bond fund, and John Lansner of the Orange County Register
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:54.060]   did a report in his local paper about what's the exposure to uninsured bonds in all of
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.020]   the different California insured municipal bond funds.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:03.460]   And I think then the limit you had to have was 65% had to be in the type of security
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.520]   that your name suggested.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.980]   And Fidelity at that time had 66% of its assets in insured bonds, and the other 34% in uninsured
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.980]   bonds.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.460]   And the manager said, "Yeah, we think insurance is just way overpriced right now, and it's
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.660]   not worth the premium you have to pay for it."
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.300]   Well, that's great, but you're selling this to the public as something that's labeled
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.020]   as an insured municipal bond fund.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.380]   And so it still seems to me that while the SEC has cleaned up on this and gone with an
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.780]   80% rule across the board, there's certain words like "insured" or "government" or "treasury"
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.620]   that really pull on investors' heartstrings.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.460]   And today, you could put four motor company bonds in a government bond fund and enhance
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.460]   your yield and not be violating any of the rules.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.540]   Now, in practice, we don't see that much of that kind of shady dealing going on in the
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540]   industry today.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.980]   I think it's a cleaner, better-lit, more fiduciary-centric industry than it was perhaps 30 years ago.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.220]   But I still think you have to be on guard against that kind of stuff, because, again,
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:06.420]   when you have intent and expectations varying greatly, investors oftentimes end up disappointed.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.540]   And just look what the credit market imploded back in the financial crisis.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.260]   You had some things that were called "government bond" that lost 30% or more, and other things
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.540]   that were called "government bond" that made money during this, and it had to do with how
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.100]   they were interpreting that mandate to invest in government bonds, and whether you were
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.340]   buying just the straight forward bonds or you were buying some kind of exotic derivatives
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.460]   somehow linked to government paper.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.220]   >>COREY: Another benefit of indexing is the transparency.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.220]   I mean, you do know what you're getting.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.220]   >>STEVE: Absolutely.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.860]   I mean, there's scores of benefits to indexing, and the longer-term view, the tax advantages,
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.900]   the truth in labeling, all of those are there.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.100]   But that said, there's a lot of craziness under the index umbrella these days.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.060]   Anytime something gains popularity and it's got someone like Jack Bogle at the forefront
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.260]   of it, you're going to attract shadier characters around the fringes of that who are going to
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.860]   quote Jack and say, "Oh yeah, following his great tradition, we're launching a set of
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.700]   market-timing triple-leveraged index funds, and these are good because they're index-oriented."
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.660]   They're like, "That's something Jack wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.420]   You really shouldn't be invoking his name on something like that."
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.660]   >>COREY: Oh, I agree.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:20.220]   I call it special-purpose indexing, spindexing.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.740]   That's what it is, just spinning something.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:28.980]   I mean, the fact is you create some crazy index based on the shoe size of the CEOs,
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.100]   and whether they're left-handed or right-handed, I mean, whatever it is, you create some crazy
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:40.860]   index, and then you turn around and you launch an ETF or a mutual fund to that index, and
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.820]   you call that mutual fund passive indexing.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.860]   I just think that the industry is getting away with way too much when they start going
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.940]   down the road of calling spindexes or comparing spindexes to traditional indexes.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:59.020]   >>GREGORY: Then you go grape yourself in the sacred cloak of indexing and invoke Jack Bogle's
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.820]   name and say, "We're doing the Lord's work."
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.700]   Jack would be rolling in his grave over there.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.700]   >>COREY: Absolutely.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.980]   I want to get into the rating systems that Morningstar uses.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.220]   You have two different types of ratings.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.980]   You have a star rating, and you have an analyst rating, so could you compare and contrast
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.980]   the two?
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.620]   >>GREGORY: Well, the star rating is something that Joe had come up with before I joined
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.020]   Morningstar, and it has some positive advantages to it, absolutely.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.980]   One would be it's longer term oriented.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.180]   The minimum period we look at is three years, and if we have a five or a 10 year history,
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.020]   we weight those more heavily.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.300]   The second thing is that it's risk adjusted, so if you go out and you take a lot of crazy
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.940]   risk, you produce a very volatile stream of returns, one that investors are unlikely to
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.380]   use well, because greater volatility means there's a greater chance you buy high and
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.020]   sell low.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.300]   You get penalized for that in the star rating system.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.220]   The other thing is that the star ratings include all costs that a mutual fund has.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.980]   It includes the expense ratio, but it also includes front end and back end sales charges.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:03.420]   We deduct those when calculating a star rating, and this was a huge improvement at the time
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.300]   it came out, back in the mid-1980s.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.540]   Back then, most of the comparisons you saw were things that said, "This fund is number
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.580]   one in its category," and sometimes the categories were very short term oriented.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.100]   It could be very narrow or very short term oriented.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.500]   It might be growth in income funds with assets of less than $25 million, and the performance
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.700]   period might be over the last three months.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.060]   The other thing is that all of those number one in category comparisons ignored any sales
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:37.420]   charges that you might incur, so it was something that really camouflaged the impact of cost,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.820]   whereas the star rating, by including the loads and by taking a longer term point of
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.460]   view where the burden of high expenses takes a greater and greater toll, or at least it's
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.580]   not camouflaged as much as it can be in short term results, the star rating was something
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.340]   that was a real important catalyst in pointing people towards not only better performing,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.380]   or at least better historical performance and lower risk, but also substantially lower
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.380]   cost funds.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.940]   I think that's one of the things Jack recognized right away, and an advantage in what Morningstar
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:13.620]   was doing, is that we were taking an approach that put more emphasis on cost than the industry
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.220]   had done to date.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.740]   I know people will complain about the star rating and say, "Well, it doesn't tell you
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   this.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.740]   It doesn't tell you that."
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.980]   We always say, "Well, first off, we never said it told you everything you needed to
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.820]   know, but it does tell you some things that are of value," and then some people would
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.900]   come and say, "Well, I think you should just buy index funds and ignore the star ratings."
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.780]   Okay, that's fine, but traditional index funds have substantially and consistently gotten
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.820]   above average star ratings, and people say, "Well, I think you should just buy Vanguard
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.380]   and Fidelity and ignore these other three fund groups."
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.500]   Well, Vanguard has consistently had the highest, or certainly among the large fund families,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.140]   the highest average star rating, so there's something right about them, but there's also
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.980]   something incomplete, and what we always said is that the star rating is an introduction,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   not a conclusion.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.980]   It's a good place to begin to screen down the universe to a more manageable size, because
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.460]   there are tens of thousands of funds out there.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.780]   You just can't possibly look at all of them.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.380]   You need to have some kind of mechanical way of reducing it to a more manageable task.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:17.140]   Then you started analyst ratings, where you gave them gold, silver, bronze.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.180]   This was more forward-looking, correct?
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.220]   Yeah, and that was the intent.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.980]   We recognized the shortcomings of the star ratings.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.820]   In fact, we conceded them before most people recognized it.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.940]   We never ran an ad that said, "Follow the stars to riches.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940]   This is all you need."
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.740]   Yeah, but there were a lot of ads that said that, but you didn't say it.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.700]   Yeah, yeah, and again, you have to go back and say, "Well, what would it be better?
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.620]   Would it be better that they're quoting the star rating that's long-term, risk and cost
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.180]   adjusted, or short-term number one in its category, when you don't even know what other
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.780]   funds are in the category, and you know that it's ignored the sales charge?"
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.900]   It was an improvement at the time, but it wasn't everything, and that's why we did the
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.980]   analyst rating.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:00.420]   We knew that we produced a whole page of research, and the star rating was just one of hundreds
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.780]   of data points on there.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.180]   Oftentimes, our analysts would say, "This fund currently has a five-star rating, but
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.380]   here's the reasons why we would be cautious and wouldn't think that that's predictive
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.380]   of the future.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.220]   Perhaps there's been a manager change, or perhaps it's just a three-year record, not
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.300]   a five- or a ten-year record, or perhaps the fund has had a certain tailwind that our analysts
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.620]   thought was unlikely to continue."
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.300]   We wanted to get more of that information into the starting point analysis, because
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.900]   we knew that some people just stopped at the star rating.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.860]   That's where the analyst ratings came about.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:37.740]   As we built up a global team of analysts that was capable of doing this kind of due diligence
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:44.620]   on funds, we decided to put more of that into a rating so that people could have something
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.820]   that would be more stable than the star ratings, and it would include more of our best thinking.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:55.380]   Again, we did not adjust a star rating if a portfolio manager left, because you never
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.580]   really knew on the outside how important was that manager, and how important was the team,
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.580]   and all kinds of variables that you didn't know that were very hard to get into a mechanical
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.740]   thing like the quantitative star ratings, but we could get into the more subjective
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.780]   analyst ratings.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.100]   That was the intent, was to give investors a better starting point than the star ratings.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:22.900]   I'm going to ask the tough question here, because you do have advertisements for mutual
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:31.820]   funds in your magazines, and in your publications, and such, and they have a tendency to want
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:39.620]   you to say certain things about them, and to give them certain ratings, and so forth.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:49.660]   There's a pay-to-play element in the financial media that basically you pay us money and
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.220]   we'll say good things about your fund and your fund company.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.260]   Can you comment, number one, about the whole industry, and number two, about Morningstar's
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.940]   approach to this?
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.060]   We didn't have advertising in our products for a long time, and as we moved into the
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.660]   web, we started taking ads.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:12.380]   The old research publications didn't, but on the web, it's part of the business model.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.460]   What we did is we said, "Well, look to the people we admire most," and we looked to The
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.180]   Wall Street Journal, we looked to The Economist, we said, "Look, there are plenty of examples
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:25.420]   where you've got an editorial function that is kept separate from the advertising, and
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.940]   it's just not that difficult to do if you've got the right culture, and you set up the
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.700]   right parameters."
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.340]   We hold our analysts to one standard and one standard only, but the only thing we hold
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.900]   our analysts to is, "Are you telling the story as fairly and accurately as possible from
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.020]   the investor's point of view?"
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.660]   That's the only standard that our analysts are held to.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.900]   Our analysts sign their work, it's out there for the world to see, and it's out there with
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.180]   all of the supporting data.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.140]   Anyone reading this can look and see, "Okay, the analyst says this fund has a consistent
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.140]   history.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   Well, let's go look at the returns.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.580]   How consistent have they been?"
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:04.820]   I think it's as transparent as it can possibly be in a realistic business model for the web.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.980]   >> Let's talk about exchange-traded funds.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   You were around when they launched the first one back in 1994, and I personally started
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.500]   using them in 1996, so there was only two of them.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:24.300]   There was SPDRs and MIDIs, but I could see that this was the future.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.780]   You picked up on that right away also, that this was the future.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.780]   >> Sure.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.100]   Well, you were really prescient, Rick, and you were among the early advisors to really
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.820]   latch onto this, and a lot of advisors wouldn't because there wasn't some kind of a commission
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.260]   baked into it.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.900]   I think what set you apart is that you're looking at this from the point of view of
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.900]   the investor.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.540]   If you were looking at it from the point of view of someone who's trying to make a buck
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.340]   selling stuff, then maybe they weren't nearly as attractive, and that's why they got ignored
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.620]   for a while.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.420]   We came at it from the same point of view as you did and say, "Look, this is low-cost.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.860]   This is good.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   We don't see the issue."
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.780]   I remember Jack Bogle had a big issue with it.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.500]   He had his shotgun analogy, saying this is a very powerful tool that could be used for
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:10.740]   self-defense or for murder and things like that.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.820]   Then when Vanguard came up with some very creative ways of attaching them or linking
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:20.180]   them to their existing funds and the tax advantages that they have, they really do have material
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:26.740]   advantages and the low-cost and the transferability of them to move them from one account to another.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.700]   There's some powerful advantages for the investor.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.860]   We were championing them because our moral compass always pointed to do what's right
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   for the investor.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.580]   If the investor wins, everyone else in the process can succeed, but if the investor is
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.100]   suffering and not doing well, then all of us have failed to do our job.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:53.700]   I recall when I first started looking into ETFs, it was around 1996 when I had my epiphany,
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.940]   my aha moment, listening to Jack Bogle and reading his books and coming up with why aren't
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.940]   I doing this for my client.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.940]   I started looking around.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.100]   I was working at Smith Barney at the time.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.740]   I was looking around saying, "Okay, where are the index funds?
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.900]   Where can I find index funds?"
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:15.380]   Of course, you couldn't find any index funds that weren't available, but by 1998, actually,
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.420]   Smith Barney did launch a clandestine index fund.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.740]   You could find it if you wanted.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.060]   We actually had one.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.700]   It was buried deep, deep, deep down in the Smith Barney mutual fund platform that was
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.820]   never advertised and nobody knew about it, but it was there and you could use it.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.500]   It was relatively low cost because they didn't want people running to Vanguard, but the only
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.940]   thing that I really had available was ETFs.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:44.820]   That's where I started putting client money.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.860]   I remember going to Jamie Dimon and I said to him, he was the president, and I said,
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.460]   "Jamie, we should do this," and he had no interest in it whatsoever.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.020]   Now everybody's doing it.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.900]   >> It didn't fit the old brokerage model.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.940]   >> No, it certainly didn't fit the model because there was no money in it.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:06.660]   There was no 12B1 fee.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:12.500]   These companies, Vanguard wasn't about ready to pay any brokerage firm a half a million
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:20.260]   dollars a year just to get in the door and buy pizza for the advisors and tell them about
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   these things.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.780]   >> Pizza's the least of what the advisors were asking for.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.420]   >> Let's talk about advisors because we're into this.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:36.060]   You talked about the evolution of active funds and how it's getting tougher for active managers
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.060]   as the world is getting smarter.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   What about advisors?
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.460]   You've written a lot about this.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.980]   In fact, a lot of the audience for Vanguard is advisors.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.260]   You have a big advisor conference every year.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.020]   How do you see that industry evolving and changing?
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.020]   >> It's been a massive change in my lifetime.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.020]   The first advisor I met was my father's stockbroker.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.860]   My dad would go to her for ideas on what stock should I buy.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.940]   The advisors started as people that would pick individual securities.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.100]   Then in time, they said, "You're not really very good at that.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.100]   You shouldn't be doing that.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.900]   You can't pick stocks, but you can pick managers, so go out and pick active managers."
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:19.100]   That became the bread and butter trade of many advisors for a number of years.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.060]   Then, as we've talked about, it got harder and harder to pick successful active managers.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.200]   Many asset management shops turned into soap operas.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.380]   The star managers become divas, and they leave in a huff.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.020]   All of a sudden, you've got all these tax consequences, and you've got to run and reshuffle.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.380]   The case for passive investing just became stronger and stronger.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.620]   The mantra among advisors came, "We can't pick stocks.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.980]   We can't pick active managers, but we can pick asset classes.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:46.020]   We can pick a whole bunch of indexes, and we can put together a good portfolio."
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.100]   That was the model for some time, but now I think you're even seeing that begin to change
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.100]   and morph.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.380]   Tim Buckley, the new head of Vanguard, in his first couple of weeks taking over as CEO,
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.220]   he started making some statements saying, "We really don't think advisors should be
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.920]   putting together portfolios.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.260]   We don't think they should be in that business.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.540]   We think they should be buying model portfolios, and that our people can put together these
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.860]   portfolios and manage them and rebalance them better than many advisors can."
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.340]   If you think about it from that perspective, the advisor has been pretty much pushed out
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.900]   of the entire investment part of the investment management process.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.980]   The fascinating thing is, even with all of these things happening, the advisor's role
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.820]   and the commitment that clients have to their advisors is as strong as ever, which suggests
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.860]   that in many cases, what the clients really wanted from the advisor was something other
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.900]   than some kind of mythical investment genius.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.260]   What they really wanted was some hand-holding and someone to listen to them and someone
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.520]   to match their goals to an investment portfolio.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.940]   Advisors are doing that today and providing an incredible value for their clients, even
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:55.260]   if they're not picking the next hot stock or the next star manager.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:01.380]   I think the role of the advisor has really shifted phenomenally in the last 30 or 40
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:07.420]   years, but the importance that the advisor has for the client hasn't diminished at all.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.700]   Most investors want to be working with someone if they navigate these difficult financial
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   planning decisions.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:20.780]   Although I see the way that advisors get paid is now becoming more in the spotlight.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.740]   I've been on all sides of it, Don.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:29.380]   I started out in the brokerage industry doing commissions and then went to the AUM, Assets
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.580]   Under Management business.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:37.540]   I had my own advisory firm doing AUM for almost 20 years, and now I'm doing an hourly model.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:42.340]   What I see, again, from looking at all these portfolios that I see every day, is I see
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.260]   advisors who want to get assets under management.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.700]   They do things that sometimes I don't agree with.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:58.780]   Just yesterday, I was talking with a client, and his advisor had him roll money out of
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:05.340]   a 401(k) into an IRA that the advisor could manage, and then when the client got another
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.460]   job at a company that had a very, very good, low-cost 401(k), he didn't advise the client
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.380]   to move that money into the new 401(k) because he would have lost the assets under management.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.620]   That precluded the client from doing a backdoor Roth and a mega-backdoor Roth, and it was
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.580]   paying management fees to this advisor.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:30.660]   In other words, the incentives of AUM to the advisor caused the advisors not always to
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.340]   make the most fiduciary decisions for the clients.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.700]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.700]   There are issues.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:42.100]   On the other hand, I think most clients prefer it, not having to write out a check, have
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.420]   it collected seamlessly, and from the advisor's standpoint, it's delightful.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.300]   If you can get paid in basis points, what a wonderful way to earn money.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   I remember one of the first fund managers I ever saw speak was a guy named Tom Ebright
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.060]   who ran money for Chuck Royce, and I remember him saying, "I get up in the middle of the
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.300]   night, and I go to the bathroom, and I'm making money.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.300]   I'm getting paid.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.260]   I'm getting paid around the clock all the time as long as that meter is ticking on the
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   AUM fees."
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.500]   If you're getting paid on assets under management, you have very little incentive to leave it,
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.860]   and as a client, even if you might look at it and say it doesn't really ... There may
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.620]   be some issues that are bad.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.260]   Most people prefer to pay in this seamless way.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.260]   That said, I think there are two things that the industry really needs to think about is
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.740]   that the AUM model does not work at all for the small client, nor does it work well for
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.740]   the large client.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.900]   For the small client, if they don't have any assets, then there's no incentive for financial
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.260]   advisors to reach out and help these people.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.660]   That's a major issue that's going to have more and more attention over the next couple
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.660]   of years.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.580]   How do we reach out to underserved communities?
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:50.180]   How do we make more people in America investors, or how do we help small investors become more
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.540]   meaningful investors, and how does the financial planning community reach out to these underserved
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.540]   communities?
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:44:01.100]   Then, on the other hand, advisors have their very successful clients who may now have tens
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.100]   of millions of dollars.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.860]   Maybe they've sold a business or something like this.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.820]   Well, for them, paying a percentage of assets under management is a huge, huge check that
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.960]   they're writing, or they're not even writing it, but they're paying each year, and as they
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.100]   wise up, I think a lot of these people would come back and say, "Hey, let's negotiate a
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.100]   flat fee.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.100]   That makes more sense to me."
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.900]   AUM doesn't work from the advisor's perspective with small clients, and it doesn't work from
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.660]   the client's perspective with large clients, but for the vast majority of people that the
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.500]   planning community works with, even though there are issues that you correctly point
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.900]   out that can create, perhaps, false incentives, I think it's one that's sort of a preferred
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:42.020]   methodology or preferred method because of its seamless nature for most participants
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.020]   and most advisors.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.060]   Well, we could have a long discussion about that, but ...
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.220]   Well, I'm arguing we're going to an hourly thing.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.220]   Oh, it's not easy.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.220]   I prefer that, though.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.340]   It's certainly not easy because you're only getting paid for the work that you do.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.460]   It's not like that other advisor saying, "Hey, this is wonderful.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.800]   As I'm sleeping, I'm making money."
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.900]   I mean, is that what a fiduciary would say?
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.860]   Well, exactly, and you don't pay your accountant that way.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.980]   You don't pay your tax advisor.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.100]   You don't pay your estate planning attorney that way.
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.340]   I mean, I do think that the trend is going to be in that direction, but given that AUM
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:19.700]   is so set up and so established, and clients aren't rebelling against it, and for most
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.980]   clients it probably wouldn't mean a major savings that they did that.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   It might just clear up some of those potential conflicts.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:30.060]   I just don't know if there's a catalyst for moving away from it, but I certainly agree
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:35.260]   with you philosophically that if you paid on an hourly basis, it would probably be better
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.660]   for the client.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:44.780]   Let's talk about something that is a move away from at least high-cost AUM, like 1%
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.700]   or so AUM fees, and that is the robo-advisor trend.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:53.560]   Vanguard just launched a new robo-advisor, a true robo-advisor.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:58.700]   They have the PAS program, which is 0.3% when you're talking to an advisor.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.400]   You get the same four-fund portfolio, but you get to talk to an advisor, and now they're
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:08.740]   at a 0.15% internet-only advisor program where you're not talking with anybody, but the cost
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:15.700]   of just getting a portfolio managed using a robo-type platform continues to come down.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   I think this is a good thing.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.500]   I mean, there are many more people that need financial planning that are getting it or
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.780]   need investment advice that are getting it, and there are big audiences that the planning
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.140]   community just has to kind of turn their back on because it doesn't make economic sense
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.140]   to serve them.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:33.660]   So the small investor with a 401(k) plan, if they can tap into some robo-advice and
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.620]   have a more diversified portfolio and build up a bigger nest egg until they get to the
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.820]   point where a financial advisor would take interest in them, and also before they get
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.500]   to the point where they've got the more sophisticated questions that an advisor can really add value
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.940]   on -- things about tax decision or charitable giving or estate planning and all of these
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.980]   -- the world of different things that advisors bring to the table.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.260]   I think this is a good thing.
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.420]   So I don't see it as a threat, I just see that there's more work to be done, more people
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:05.740]   that need some kind of help, and that these are going to be a big part of the future.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.780]   And I do think that the biggest robo-advisors are not going to be some kind of high-tech
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.780]   startup.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.220]   It's going to be Vanguard, and it's going to be Schwab, and it's going to be people
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.460]   that already have assets under management and can layer on these additional services
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.560]   at a low cost to the asset management service they're already providing.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.940]   They're going to be the big players here.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.460]   One new type of indexing that's available -- it's actually been around for a long time,
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:37.940]   but it has become more popular lately -- is direct indexing, which is building your own
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:46.140]   portfolio of 500 stocks, and then selling off individual stocks that are at a loss so
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:52.300]   you can generate tax losses, which you can use against capital gain that you might have
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.740]   from selling a business or something, or a single-stock position from RSUs or whatever
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.060]   you have.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.980]   And this is a growing business.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.980]   What are your feelings about it?
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.700]   I have mixed feelings about it.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.980]   Well, I think parts of it are really cool.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.420]   I like the idea.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:15.140]   I also suspect it's more sophistication than your typical investor needs or wants.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.420]   But the great thing to me is you're seeing a spectrum of opportunities, and you can decide
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.860]   to invest at whatever level of complexity that you like today.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.940]   You can do one-stop shopping, just buy a TargetAid fund or a balance fund and just leave it there,
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.860]   or you could assemble a portfolio of individual funds, or you can just buy an index fund,
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.140]   or you can create your own index.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:37.700]   I mean, there are just so many good solutions out there, and you and your advisor just have
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.380]   a decision, what complexity level do we want to play the game at?
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.860]   And I think that's a wonderful thing.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:47.420]   So I think direct indexing can be a very good thing, but I think most people come to mutual
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:51.500]   funds because they want it to be simpler, and they're not looking to add complexity.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:56.060]   But there are some cases where, as you point out, perhaps you've sold a business or you're
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.020]   selling a business and you've got a lot of capital gains and you want to find ways to
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:07.020]   offset them, but look at how tax-efficient a broad-based total market ETF is today.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.740]   What kind of additional benefits are you going to get from direct indexing, and do the costs
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.220]   perhaps outweigh that?
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.220]   Those are open questions.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.100]   But the nice thing is that we're competing on what's a better offer for investors as
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:23.180]   opposed to what's a better deal for those people trying to sell you an investment option.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:27.260]   So I see that as being on the positive side of the ledger.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:36.700]   Let's talk about ESG, environmental, social, and governance, and the kind of the start
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.700]   and stop that we have seen in this over the years.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.620]   We've had social responsible that sort of started and then it stopped.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:48.940]   Now we have ESG, which seems to be getting traction in this social environment that we're
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.940]   in.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:50.940]   Do you think this is it?
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.940]   Do you think it's going to grow now?
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.940]   I do.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.940]   I'm in favor of this.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.940]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.500]   And to me, it gets back to investor rights.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.040]   And I think in the early days of Morningstar, what we were fighting for is that investors
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.940]   had a right to know how their money was being managed, what the costs were, who the portfolio
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.300]   manager was, what the fund was actually doing.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.260]   And I think today you can extend that and say, look, as an investor today, you might
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.680]   have concerns that go beyond just your mercenary ones and beyond just finances.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.300]   You want to know what impact your money is having on the world around you.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.240]   And you shudder at the fact that maybe you're making a profit from a company that's out
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.440]   polluting the environment that your children and your grandkids are going to live in in
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.540]   the future.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.820]   And so I think investors have every right to know what impact their money has.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:39.820]   So more transparency, more data on environmental governance, social issues, I think these are
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.820]   positive trends.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:46.500]   And I do think we're going to move from more of a shareholder oriented focus to a stakeholder
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:51.460]   oriented focus, simply because the shareholders have needs beyond their financial ones.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.300]   They have concerns about the environment, about society.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.860]   And we're seeing that with young people very much today.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:03.460]   My son, he buys stocks, he buys funds, but he does a lot of due diligence, or he does
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.860]   as much due diligence, I would say, on the ESG factors as he does on the financial ones.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.180]   And I think that's a trend that's going to stay.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.700]   And I think it's all about investor rights, that you have a right to know what impact
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.540]   your investments have on the world around you.
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.940]   Money is a means to an end, it's not just a goal in and of itself.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.660]   It's not some game where whoever ends up with the biggest pile of greenbacks wins and everyone
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.660]   else loses.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:34.180]   It's about reaching your goals and defining your own success.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:39.500]   And if being a participant in a process that makes the world more the kind of world you
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:46.700]   want to live in, that's a very viable concern for your money.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.620]   Let's talk about a couple more topics.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.300]   One of them is fixed income.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:52:00.020]   So we've reached an interesting place in history here, where interest rates are going to remain
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.020]   very low for a very long period of time.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:12.580]   In fact, the Federal Reserve is changing the way they operate relative to inflation, where
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:19.540]   basically going to let inflation rise, as opposed to trying to cut off inflation to
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.140]   make sure that it doesn't get above their 2% target.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:30.620]   Now, these are all big changes to a financial system that are going to cause and are causing
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.300]   valuations of all asset classes to change.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.540]   I want to hear your feelings about what you think this all means.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:45.060]   Those are great questions, because it potentially means that any kind of backward-looking asset
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:51.780]   allocation and research that we do may be of very little utility, because we're entering
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.060]   into a future that's going to look very different from the past.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.820]   And the same thing happened when we went off the gold standard.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:02.740]   And you need to think about what are the implications of that, because suddenly fixed income returns
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.860]   may look very different than they have in the past.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:10.460]   Certainly, the benefit of being in fixed income today is much harder to make a pound-the-table
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.460]   argument for.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.700]   If you can get a higher yield from buying the S&P 500 than you can from buying a lot
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:20.580]   of bond funds, especially if you're looking at a high-cost bond fund and a low-cost S&P
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:24.700]   index fund, it's kind of hard to make the case that we need to be in fixed income in
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.180]   a major way.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.980]   And I understand that responsible advisors and Vanguard and others still make the case
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.980]   that you need fixed income.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:37.980]   And I don't disagree with that, because it certainly adds balance and maybe gunpowder
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.840]   or something or firepower for the future to the portfolio.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:46.700]   But the benefits of fixed income, it's hard to see how you can use that as a major asset
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.820]   towards wealth creation going forward.
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.820]   And it has been an enormous engine of wealth creation for the last 30 years.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.500]   I don't see how you can argue it's going to be that way for the next decade.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.500]   I know.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.500]   It's going to be tough.
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.740]   And a lot of people who are retired and relying on fixed income, or if they're going to
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:09.020]   annuitize their lump sum, the payouts are going to be smaller.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:14.100]   It's pushing people into more risky asset classes, and that could have consequences
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.100]   also.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:20.220]   It certainly could cause the market to go to P/E levels that we hadn't seen in many,
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.220]   many years.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.220]   Exactly right.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.700]   And the net result is that the investor will be exposed to greater risks because of it.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.060]   And some of the things that people had counted on for their retirement years, the ability
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:39.140]   to, say, lock in a rate of return near the 4% to 5% rate, which would get you those long-term
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:43.980]   stability of assets that you need in many of the retirement models, you're not going
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.020]   to get that from fixed income.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.180]   You're only going to get it from taking higher risk.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:50.780]   And that's a dangerous position to be in when you've got the baby boom generation on the
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.780]   cusp of retirement.
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.460]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   One final item, and that is cyber currencies.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:07.100]   How long do you think it will be before cyber currencies make their way into Schwab, Fidelity,
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:15.420]   Merrill, where they become part of the asset mix for advisors and investors?
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:20.980]   You know, Rick, I'm not an expert on this, so please take whatever I say with a huge
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.340]   grain of salt.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.260]   I would say that, you know, currencies aren't something that investors have used successfully
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.500]   in their investment programs historically.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.740]   So I don't think that aspect is going to become a huge one.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.920]   What I would say is that you'll probably see, you know, there'll be maybe early adopters.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.220]   I think there are some benefits to these.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.100]   My guess is that you'll see Vanguard be among the later ones.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.460]   They'll let others go out and test the waters.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:50.940]   Most asset firms that I talk to, they're interested in the technology behind cybersecurity for
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.700]   internal processing, for a lot of different things.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:56:00.780]   But cyber securities as an asset class, I think, have a long...are probably something
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   on the horizon.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:06.640]   But we have a long way to go before you can say that investing in those is a well-researched,
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.320]   responsible choice, you know, something that sort of would fit the prudent man rule.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.100]   And my guess is that a firm like, say, Vanguard or T. Rowe that, you know, tend to be more
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:22.060]   conservative will let some other firms, you know, go out there and test the waters first.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.620]   And change always happens at the margins.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.180]   It's not the established players that are the first to embrace a new technology.
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.820]   It's some that come along and embrace it, and some get burned, and others figure out
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   ways to make it work.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.100]   And I think if you're an investor who's interested in it, you know, wait and see who figures
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.980]   out how to make this work and really benefit a portfolio.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.580]   You don't have to be the first to try something.
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:44.740]   It can still have benefits for you down the road once some of the kinks have been worked
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:45.740]   out.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:52.380]   I see a world, maybe when my grandchildren are my age, I see a world where they might
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:57:04.140]   be trading S&P 500 coins globally, along with MSCI coins and total bond market coins.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:09.460]   In other words, a portfolio instead of a portfolio of mutual funds or portfolio of ETFs, they
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:15.500]   actually have a portfolio of coins or cyber currencies that have the backing of markets
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.540]   all over the world, where these things trade all over the world in any market.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:23.340]   It's like their Pokemon games that they've been playing for years, right?
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340]   Exactly.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:31.300]   Only this is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week market, and it's all done through cyber currency.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.620]   So that's what I envision.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:33.620]   It could happen.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.340]   And the thing, you know, when you and I got into this business, would you ever have imagined
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:42.900]   ETFs and the range of choices that you have in them, and what a great toolkit the investor
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.700]   today has, compared to what we had 30 years ago?
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.520]   Today, the toolkit that the investor has is phenomenal.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.380]   The number of quality, low-cost, high-quality options that are out there for investing is
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.380]   staggering.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.500]   I mean, today, the individual investor has the tools that only the most sophisticated
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.340]   pros had 30 years ago.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:07.500]   So I think it boggles our mind what might be out there 30 years from now, but I can
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.100]   tell you the one thing I do know is that the things that win are going to be those that
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.420]   serve investors well, and the failures are going to be those things that over-promise
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.300]   and under-deliver and disappoint investors.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:21.180]   Don, it's been a real pleasure having you on "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.380]   Thank you so much for your time.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   Rick, thank you very much.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.700]   And my heart goes out to the Bogleheads.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:29.060]   I think you guys are just phenomenal, and I know how much the Bogleheads meant to Jack
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.660]   Bogle, and Jack is one of my great heroes.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:37.140]   I saw how touched he was by the love and the affection that the Bogleheads poured out,
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.900]   but more than that, I think he'd be incredibly proud by the work that they continue to do,
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:46.220]   and being out there and being advocates for better investor outcomes, and that's something
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.460]   that I know he would share.
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.700]   Thank you.
