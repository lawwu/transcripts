[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.160]   and in this episode I have a special guest with me,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.840]   Eric Rosenberg, freelance extraordinaire.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.040]   Say hello.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.720]   - Hello, so excited to be here.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.400]   Thanks for having me on the show.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.220]   - No problem.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.600]   So we go way back, maybe 12, 13 years,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.760]   since I started Financial Samurai in 2009.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.720]   What were you doing back in 2009?
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.320]   - I was actually had just started
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.680]   my own personal finance blog as well.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.560]   I started it October 2008,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.680]   so I think that makes us dinosaur bloggers.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.960]   - Oh wow, yeah.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.420]   - It was a fun little journey.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.920]   I didn't know anything about online marketing
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.840]   really at that point,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.400]   so I made the really good decision
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   of starting at narrowbridgeadventures.blogspot.com.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.280]   - Okay.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   - Definitely learned a bit along the way,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.880]   so now my main personal finance site
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.840]   is called Personal Profitability,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.560]   but that actually leveraged me into doing freelancing,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.040]   which is how I was able to quit my old day job
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.120]   and become self-employed and control my schedule.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.140]   Now I don't have to ask for time off from anybody
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.480]   when I wanna be away.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.960]   So my lifestyle has changed a lot
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.560]   because of that little blog I started way back when.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.720]   - Yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.200]   You got your MBA,
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.580]   and what did you do after business school first,
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.000]   and then how did you start doing
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.560]   the freelancing stuff, I guess?
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.020]   - Yeah, well, so I guess I'll back up a little bit.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.720]   I started my first blog in,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.880]   I think it was the summer of 2006.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.400]   I was working at a Boy Scout camp,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.320]   and it was my seventh summer working there,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.000]   and I was the office manager.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.200]   So I was dealing with a lot of the paperwork,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.660]   the finances of troops checking in and out,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.560]   that kind of stuff,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.840]   but when I wasn't dealing with Scoutmasters,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.120]   and scouts didn't come into the office all that much,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.080]   that gave me a little bit of downtime.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.260]   We had this brand new thing
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.280]   called satellite internet in the office,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.080]   and I had my big old heavy laptop from school.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.680]   So in my little bit of downtime here and there,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   I started a personal blog,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.280]   and that gave me a little intro to the world of blogging.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.800]   And then 2007, I finished my undergrad
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.360]   with a finance degree,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.860]   and I started working as a bank manager,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.360]   and I was reading all these personal finance blogs,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.660]   mostly by people who were in debt,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.600]   and they had a lot of credit card debt,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.680]   and they were telling their stories
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.040]   about how they were getting out of debt
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.120]   and fixing their credit,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.520]   what they were learning,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160]   and when I quit working in the bank
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.880]   'cause I didn't like my banker's hours,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.560]   which were about seven to seven,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.880]   I started thinking,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.080]   well, geez, I have a finance degree,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.600]   I've never been in debt,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   I graduated from undergrad debt-free,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.900]   had a great credit score,
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.320]   maybe I should start blogging about personal finance.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.600]   So that's when I started
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.280]   what was then Narrowbridge Finance,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.720]   Narrowbridge Adventures,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.000]   and I had that little bit of finance under my belt,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.920]   and then I switched into cubicle land.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.160]   I did corporate finance and accounting for about a decade,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   and I got the MBA full-time while working full-time.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.440]   So I was super busy,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   and I kept the blog going.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.400]   The quality wasn't quite what I would have probably wanted,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.360]   but busy with work and school.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.720]   But I kept the blog going,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.800]   and I was learning a lot,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.680]   and that MBA helped me get better jobs,
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.880]   you know, as one would hope.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   I invested a lot of money to get an MBA.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   I'm proud to say it has paid off multiple times.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.060]   And along the way,
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.320]   I still kept that blog thing going as a side hustle.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.880]   And it grew and grew,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.000]   and actually through the Yawkeesi,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.600]   that group that Sam founded,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.520]   I started doing a few articles here and there
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.880]   on some other personal finance blogs.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.120]   Not getting paid a whole lot,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.400]   but I was like, hey, you know,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.040]   making some beer money here in my 20s.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.520]   I went to nightclubs a lot.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.260]   I like the EDM world, you know,
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.320]   boom, boom, boom kind of music.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.760]   So it was nice to have a few extra bucks coming in,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.960]   and it paid off my MBA loans,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   paid off my car loan early.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.820]   My MBA loans, I paid off two years
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.060]   and six days after graduation,
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.780]   which I'm always a little mad payday wasn't a week earlier,
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.440]   'cause then I could say under two years.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.700]   That six days always bothers me.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.620]   So, but along the way,
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.900]   I kept that blog going,
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.600]   and I started going to this conference called FinCon,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.140]   where Sam and I have hung out in person a few times.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.540]   And through FinCon,
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.080]   I connected with some bigger companies
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.900]   that were looking for freelance writing.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.260]   And I was, they said, oh, you know,
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.160]   we like your blog.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.540]   We like what you're doing there.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.940]   Will you write your story for us
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.780]   and help write financial advice on our site?
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.820]   And my first bigger client
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.900]   that you might've heard of was Betterment.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.980]   So thank you to them for bringing me on.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.460]   And that really changed the trajectory of my online work.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.300]   'Cause up until that point,
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   I'd thought maybe I'd have a site,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.140]   you know, more like yours,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.420]   a big site with a lot of people coming every month.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.780]   I looked up to Pat Flynn a lot from Smart Passive Income.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.720]   I thought, yeah, I could be like a little mini celebrity
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.140]   in my own world online.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.500]   And make a bunch of money from my website.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.340]   But Google seemed to have other plans for my website.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.340]   I didn't ever get a ton, a ton of traffic.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.100]   But I got enough recognition from my credentials
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.700]   and the quality of what I was writing
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.660]   that I just kept getting more freelance opportunities.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.600]   So I started to do something
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.900]   that I always advise people to do.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.460]   Look at what you're working on and see what's working.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.100]   And even if that's not what you expect to be working,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.660]   if it's working, that's where you should double down.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.860]   So on the blog, I had certain topics that did really well
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.640]   and I wrote similar posts and they kept doing well,
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.220]   not surprisingly.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.700]   But 'cause I was making more money
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.980]   with the freelancing thing,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.580]   that's where I really started to focus my efforts.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.900]   And I kept going back to FinCon every year
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.480]   and I met these great companies
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.340]   and built a larger and larger writing portfolio.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.000]   And in 2000, let's see, 16,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   or actually 2015, I'd made $40,000 on the side,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.940]   mostly from freelance writing,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.900]   also freelance website designs.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.740]   Those were my kind of two main things
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.300]   I was focusing on outside of the day job.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.460]   And I realized, wow, 40,000 on the side,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.780]   living in Portland at the time,
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.740]   that was what the average person in Portland made in a year.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.260]   I thought if I could do that in 10 to 20 hours a week,
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.060]   imagine what I could do if I went full time
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.540]   and started doing this 40 or who knows
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.960]   how many hours a week it would turn into.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.520]   And what really led me to make the big change
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.160]   and leave the day job, 'cause I was doing pretty well.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.080]   I had the MBA, I was working as a senior financial analyst
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.840]   at a big financial and payments company
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.920]   on the card services division.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.480]   I had great health insurance, great benefits,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   a team that I really enjoyed working with.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   But one day I had to go,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   if anyone out there's worked in accounting,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.500]   you know close is a busy time of the month.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300]   That's usually the first few days of the month
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.360]   if you're not from the accounting world.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.880]   And I had a couple days that I was gonna have to go in
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.540]   really early and leave really late.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.340]   And one day I had to go to work before my daughter,
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.880]   who was then about four months old, was awake for the day.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.240]   And I got home when she was already asleep for the night.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.600]   And it looked like I was gonna have to do
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.320]   the same thing the next day.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.460]   And I was like, this isn't why I go to work.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.100]   And I'd always kind of thought about
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.860]   going full time for myself.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.680]   One of the biggest reasons I hadn't
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.720]   was 'cause of the cost of health insurance,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.100]   which is still, it's actually more than my mortgage.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.600]   And I live in Southern California,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.000]   so it says what health insurance costs.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.760]   But there was just that point I thought,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.840]   this isn't what my life is about.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.600]   I'm not living to work, I wanna live for my family
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.360]   and work to support that.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.080]   And if work is taking so much away from my family,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.320]   that's not what I wanna be doing.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.380]   So like any good, responsible dad
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.140]   with a four-month-old baby and a stay-at-home mom/wife,
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.420]   I quit my job and sold my house
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.180]   and moved to one of the most expensive parts of America.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.680]   And here I am, it's like seven years later,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.640]   and things are going great.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.180]   So that's the basic journey of how I got to where I am.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.140]   - That's a good journey.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.000]   A lot of risk-taking here.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.860]   Freelancing is something that I feel most people should do.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.520]   Why don't more people try to make more money on the side?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.080]   If you only work 40 hours a week,
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.840]   that's a single-digit workday.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.800]   And let's be honest,
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.720]   we're not working all eight hours a day, right?
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.600]   There's probably downtime, go to the bathroom,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   water cooler, whatever it is.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.460]   Why don't more people do freelance work
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.080]   since there are so many opportunities online right now
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.880]   with so many platforms to provide those opportunities?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.240]   - Yeah, I think that's a great question.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.180]   I think a lot of people just don't realize
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.400]   what the opportunities are.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.440]   If you have a degree in something,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.480]   there's probably someone who will pay you
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.040]   to use that outside of your job.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.000]   And if you think about it from the employer perspective,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.160]   hiring a full-time person's a lot of money.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.120]   It's a big commitment.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.480]   You have that, let's say I actually just had,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.920]   for about a year, had a full-time employee working for me.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.040]   No matter what happened, I had a certain amount
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.300]   I had to pay him every week or every other week for payday.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.800]   I was doing weekly.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.480]   I had extra insurance, extra taxes.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.400]   There's a lot of things that you have to do
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.780]   and have to pay when you have an employee.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.680]   But when you have a freelancer,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.720]   you're really just paying for performance
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.320]   and there's a lot less risk.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.240]   All of my contracts with my clients basically say,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.060]   if they're unhappy with my work,
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.040]   they can just stop giving me assignments.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.120]   So if, or if I've had some, not too long ago,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.240]   there was a huge wave of layoffs in the tech world.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.380]   So some clients just didn't have the budget anymore
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.140]   and they said, sorry, we have to cut back
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.340]   or cut completely what we're doing with you.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.300]   So that's a risk on the freelancer side.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.100]   But if you think about it from the boss's side,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.820]   there's a lot more potential benefit
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.880]   from working with freelancers with lower risk
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.620]   than there is to hiring employees.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.300]   So when you have that mindset
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.220]   and know what value you can offer,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.460]   that's where you can really start
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.420]   to find great opportunities.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.800]   And also, it was a lot easier for me
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.360]   when I was in my twenties to do freelancing
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.720]   and side hustle kind of jobs.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.680]   Now I have three kids and a wife.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.560]   So there's a little bit less time,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.440]   but because I invested the time to learn other skills,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.300]   to learn how to work online,
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.760]   all of these other things I started doing in my twenties,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.160]   I was able to leverage that
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.400]   into real career opportunities in my thirties.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.360]   But that doesn't mean it's too late.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.920]   If you're 45 and have kids,
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.900]   you probably still have down hours.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.660]   Like Sam was saying, you might have a lunch break.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.260]   If you have a personal laptop,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.540]   there's no reason you can't go to the pizza place
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.500]   down the block that has wifi
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.540]   and have a slice of pizza and write a blog post.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.680]   Or if you have, I'll throw out accounting again,
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.500]   maybe you could do weekend bookkeeping for your business.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.660]   You spend a couple hours on a Sunday.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.220]   There's things people need and they will pay you to do it
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.060]   if you do a good job.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.820]   - So I guess the question would be for many listeners
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.460]   who want to freelance but have never freelanced before,
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.680]   how does one get started?
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.040]   What are the main areas to get started
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.300]   with finding these freelance gigs?
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.780]   - Yeah, so the first thing is to think about
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.260]   what you can offer and what someone's willing to pay.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.380]   And there's actually a great book
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.180]   called "The $100 Startup" by Chris Guillebeau.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.620]   He has a bunch of good books.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.780]   One of the things he says in that book is
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.940]   to have a business, you really only need three things.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.180]   Something that you sell,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.260]   whether that's a product or service,
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.180]   someone to buy that, and a way to deliver it.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.620]   So that's really all you need to freelance.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.820]   So first you have to pick what service somebody wants.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.660]   Remember, just because you want to do it
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.020]   doesn't mean someone is willing to pay for it.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.640]   So you have to think of what you're able to do
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.740]   that someone's willing to pay for.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.060]   Then you just have to find the person willing to pay.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.860]   So think about, for me, while I have a finance degree,
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.260]   I always seem to have a knack for writing.
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.700]   I did well with English and writing classes
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.300]   and later on in high school and college.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.620]   I always hated language arts and English classes
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.220]   until halfway through high school.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.780]   And then I had a couple of really good English teachers
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.780]   that changed my perspective on writing.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.740]   So ever since then, I was always,
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.020]   I looked at writing as something I enjoyed.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.860]   And as I mentioned, I started just as a little fun side
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.660]   thing when I had a few hours off at camp.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.980]   So that, for me, was something I could do.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.140]   And I was able to find ways to get paid to do it.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.180]   But think about other things people
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.740]   are willing to pay to do, particularly things
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.420]   you can do online remotely, which
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.260]   is a lot of things these days.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.900]   Graphic design, if you know how to do Photoshop really well,
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.780]   there's probably somebody who would pay you to do that.
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.580]   It could even be photo editing for people
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.540]   who take their own wedding photos or something
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.380]   and they want those touched up.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.860]   Maybe it's bookkeeping, I mentioned.
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.220]   That's something that, if you're really good at math,
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.940]   you don't even need an accounting degree.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.980]   You just need to understand how QuickBooks and similar software
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.860]   works.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.140]   And there are probably some small business owners
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.340]   who don't want to understand how it works
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.060]   and are happy to pay you to do that for them.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.960]   There's just so many things you can do online these days.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.340]   If you have coding skills, it's a little bit more competitive
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.060]   right now because of all the tech people who got laid off
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.860]   who also have coding skills.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.940]   But you don't even need to have a degree in computer science
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.340]   to build websites.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.740]   As Sam mentioned, I've worked with him on his website
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.660]   to do upgrades.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.620]   And I don't have a degree in computer science.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.420]   I self-taught HTML and PHP and CSS.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.100]   Recently, I've learned Python, so I've
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.180]   been able to build some of my own apps.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.260]   So if you're able to learn something that helps somebody,
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.980]   you can make money helping them.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.740]   So just keep thinking through what skills you have
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.900]   and who would want those skills and find those people.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.820]   And there's marketplaces you can use to start out.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.260]   There are sites like Fiverr and Upwork.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.540]   Those are good.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.820]   I'd say they're usually better for newer freelancers,
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.220]   not once you're farther in, because they're
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.220]   ultra-competitive and you're competing
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.060]   against people in India and Philippines
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.340]   who are willing to work for a lot less than you probably.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.020]   But you can get some of those first gigs there,
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.460]   start building your portfolio.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.860]   I always think everybody, regardless
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.220]   of if you're freelancing or not, should have your own website.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.860]   I'm a big fan of getting yourname.com,
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.540]   or as close as you can to that.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.660]   And start building a portfolio to show off what you can do.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.540]   So for me, it was writing for some people.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.500]   It could be graphics for some people.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.100]   Like I say, who knows what it could be?
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:43.980]   It could be an editor.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.420]   You could be a, I don't know, freelance engineer.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.980]   Whatever you do, start building that portfolio.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.180]   And even if they pay less, it's good to find
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.860]   those first few clients.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.900]   I'd never say to work for free, but I
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.300]   would work for less early on.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.380]   And then you have that base to build on,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.540]   and you can start networking.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.300]   I find a lot of clients at conferences.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.140]   I actually had to do a couple of conferences
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.660]   in the next couple of months where
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.580]   I plan to find new clients.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.100]   Those in-person connections have been
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.940]   instrumental for my business.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.420]   But everyone I've worked with, I've not
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.980]   met in person necessarily.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.860]   So once you start building your portfolio,
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.100]   you can start building a reputation in that industry.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.340]   And hopefully, your freelance business will blossom.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.380]   How easy is it to start a site nowadays?
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.660]   And how much does it cost on average?
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.660]   And we're talking about, let's say, a good site.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.980]   And do you recommend going with those pre-built sites,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.140]   like Wix or whatever, or a WordPress site,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.100]   like the one Financial Samurai is on?
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.860]   How quick and easy is it to do?
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.100]   So quick and easy depends on your internet and computer
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.100]   skills.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.620]   OK.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.980]   But for most people, you can run a website.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.340]   If your name.com is available or something similar,
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.820]   the domain cost is about $10 a year.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.460]   I now do all of my domains on CloudFlare.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.940]   So they're like $8 and something cents a year.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.540]   It's about the cheapest you can find.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.340]   So that's where I do my domains.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.020]   But you could get them from GoDaddy.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.180]   There's lots of sites there.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.300]   They're like $12 a year.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.260]   Something I like to remind people--
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.700]   like, I've seen people who work really, really hard
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   on their blogs.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.860]   And they keep them at .blogspot.com or .wordpress.com.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.060]   And I think, why, if you're willing to do all this work
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.260]   on something, would you not spend $1 a month
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.420]   to get your own piece of real estate?
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.140]   I have something like 42 domain names right now,
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.500]   which is more than most people need.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.820]   But I have every permutation of my name you can get,
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.220]   or I could get.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.740]   But you don't need that many.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.420]   You just get-- like, Sam has financialsamurai.com.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.620]   But let's say your name is--
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.620]   I don't know-- John Smith.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.540]   Johnsmith.com is probably already taken.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.900]   But get something as close to that as you can.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.700]   It'll be about $10 a year.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.060]   Then for the hosting, I recommend WordPress
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.260]   over things like Squarespace and Wix.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.580]   There are all these little site builders that--
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.820]   they're OK.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.140]   You can drag and drop and get something that looks all right
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.220]   pretty quickly.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.340]   But at the end of the day, you don't really own it.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.660]   It's sitting on someone else's server.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.620]   And you are tied to that service as long
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.300]   as you have that website.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.740]   Where WordPress, which is what my sites are all built on
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.180]   and what Sam's site is built on, it's
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.980]   on whatever server you choose.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.420]   And there's a lot of hosting companies out there.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.660]   So if you're not happy with your host, you can move it.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.220]   And if you find--
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.340]   there are some good discount hosts out there that are $5,
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.700]   $10 a month.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.220]   So for a year, let's say $60, $70.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.100]   All in, on average, with a domain name and hosting,
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.100]   let's say maybe $60 to $100 a year is what you would spend,
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.780]   which I think is pretty reasonable to have
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.060]   your own chunk of the internet.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.500]   And hopefully have that come up first
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.140]   if someone Googles your name.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.260]   You can create the resume you want the world to see
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.020]   and have that come up first.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.860]   And with WordPress, a lot of people don't realize--
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.340]   so when I started way back when to install WordPress,
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.940]   you had to really know a bunch of codey things.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.300]   You had to be able to move files to servers
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.860]   and set up databases and whatnot.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.780]   But these days, you can click one button
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.180]   on most hosting companies.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.660]   There's a handful of big hosting companies that all have this.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.500]   A lot of them use something called cPanel on the back end.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.700]   It's short for control panel.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.460]   So you go into cPanel.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.780]   And at the bottom, there's something that'll say, soft,
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.260]   delicious site installer, something like that.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.460]   You click on it.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.580]   And then there's a list of different things
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.900]   you can put on your server.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.740]   And one of them is WordPress.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.060]   You click on that.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.500]   You type in your email and choose a password
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.940]   and click Install.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.300]   And your site is up and running.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.100]   It takes less than five minutes.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.380]   Even a grandma can do that in less than five minutes.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.420]   If you can send an email and do basic web browsing,
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.660]   you could do this in about five minutes.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.340]   Well, how about-- we're just at the bottom in terms
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.620]   of understanding the internet.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:32.380]   So how much could I pay you to help launch a decent site
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.420]   from scratch?
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.220]   So me, these days, my rate would be $5,000 for a full website.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:38.740]   Oh, nice.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.700]   And I'm definitely not the cheapest out there.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.220]   I'm definitely not the most expensive out there.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.020]   When I work with a brand and they want a brand new site
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.140]   and a brand new design, and I can help them with logos
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.460]   and get their basic text written out for a handful of pages,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.380]   make sure they have a nice home page, an about page,
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.540]   a contact form that works, those are the things
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.740]   that I would package it all together.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.300]   OK, cool.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.620]   There are cheaper people out there.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.420]   If you want to do it for a couple hundred bucks,
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.620]   you can find somebody on those sites
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.740]   that I mentioned that you could go find gigs on, Fiverr
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.380]   or Upwork, places like that, even Craigslist,
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.140]   if you trust it, Facebook Marketplace.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.780]   You could find designers who will do it
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.300]   for a couple hundred bucks.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.620]   The quality might not be the same
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.500]   as when you pay somebody who works with bigger companies,
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   usually, like me.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.340]   I often work with large brands these days.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.700]   But you can get something out there put together.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.700]   If you don't want to do anything yourself,
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.740]   you can just send them a message,
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.340]   like I want a site that's basically these colors,
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.820]   here's the things that I want included.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.140]   You could probably find someone for a few hundred dollars
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.540]   that will get the basics done for you.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.180]   And then once you get started, I feel like, for me,
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.220]   I came up with the idea of Financial Samurai in 2006.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.500]   And I didn't start until 2009 because I was busy,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.100]   business school, and then I was like, well, OK,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.700]   the global financial crisis is here,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.820]   time to have a backup plan.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.260]   But I just couldn't get started.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.780]   And that start from zero to one, I feel,
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.420]   is the biggest hurdle for most people.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.140]   Because once you start, you can adapt and pivot and adjust
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.860]   and make your site better and so forth.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.460]   Absolutely.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.140]   I have a friend who comes to mind when you say that.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.860]   I'm not going to call him out by name.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.580]   He's a nice guy.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.660]   He's been a friend for a long time.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.900]   And we kept talking about all these entrepreneurial ideas.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.420]   He's like, I want to start a blog.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   And now I can't figure out the name.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.260]   And now I can't figure out the logo.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.820]   And now I can't figure out this.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.620]   And now I can't figure out that.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.180]   And years go by.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.060]   And something that I always used in my day jobs
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.740]   that's a philosophy I still hold to and what I do
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.860]   is don't let perfection get in the way of progress.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.420]   You don't have to have a perfect website to get started.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.460]   As Sam just said, you can always improve it.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.220]   If you don't like your logo, change it.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.940]   If you don't like your design, pick a new one.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.340]   If you don't like the words on your home page, rewrite it.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.700]   It's not rocket science here.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.660]   It's something you can do sitting
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.460]   at home on your laptop with a movie on in the background
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.700]   while you have a bowl of popcorn next to you
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.980]   and you're hacking away on the computer.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.180]   It's not that difficult. But if you don't start,
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.380]   it's impossible.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.060]   So just start.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.300]   Just start, folks.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.820]   You never know where it will take you.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.260]   I never thought-- I remember when I started
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.900]   Financial Samurai in 2009, I thought, OK,
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.380]   I would like to retire by 40.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.540]   At that time, I was like 32.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.700]   And I was thinking, if I could make $1,000 a month
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.900]   while in Hawaii, that'd be some great supplemental income
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.220]   in an early retirement Hawaii lifestyle.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.820]   And so it grew larger than I expected.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.980]   And that's the thing, folks.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.020]   If you start, you tinker with it,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.580]   and you work on something you enjoy,
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.580]   you might be surprised where it could take you.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.620]   It might not grow to be a very big site,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   but at least you'll brand yourself online.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.380]   You'll have your own customized resume.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.140]   And you'll attract, due to the law of attraction,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.820]   people who are looking for the things that you can offer.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.420]   Totally.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.100]   Like you say, you never know where it'll take you.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.580]   When I started, I was really excited when
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.300]   I got a $5 ad on my website.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.940]   That's like enough to buy a beer.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.100]   That's not today's inflation rates.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.700]   Beers used to be $5.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.940]   That ages me, right?
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.820]   So I was like, yeah, $5.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.220]   Wow, I could do something with that.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.020]   And then it got to a point I was making a couple hundred bucks
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.500]   a month.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.820]   And I was like, wow, this is enough to make a car payment
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.140]   or enough for all of my beers for a month.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.380]   Then it grew to a point that I was making $1,000 some months.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.740]   And I was like, wow, this is covering my rent.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.940]   This could cover a mortgage someday.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.900]   And now, I don't remember the last month
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.460]   that I did less than $10,000 in a month.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.620]   And it started somewhere.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.900]   It started with that $5 ad on my blog.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.740]   And now, it pays for my whole family to live.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.300]   So you got to--
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.020]   you say, you got to go from zero to one.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.500]   You got to start somewhere.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.260]   And you can always grow and build and pivot and improve.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.300]   But if you don't have something, you're not--
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.100]   you can't do anything with nothing, right?
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.580]   So you've got to start something.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.820]   So starting is the biggest hurdle.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.180]   You heard from Eric, we could start with a couple hundred
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.740]   bucks, maybe $500.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.980]   You can start a website and just go.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:35.140]   So the other hurdle is quitting or keeping consistency.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.660]   Why do people quit?
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.940]   Why do people give up when you can just keep on going?
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.140]   Because you'll never lose if you don't quit.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.340]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.240]   If you look at a lot of businesses,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.100]   if you look at small business administration statistics,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.540]   something like half of businesses
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.900]   don't make it 10 years.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.660]   I think that's the number.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.540]   You can look it up.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.820]   Don't quote me on it.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.420]   Something like that.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.780]   But with blogging and things like that, online projects,
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.420]   I'd say the attrition rate is much higher.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.260]   There's probably millions of blogs
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.060]   that were really exciting to the person who started them
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.300]   for the first month.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.660]   And then they weren't on the cover of USA Today
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.740]   or invited on a national talk show.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.540]   So they were like, oh, well, I'm a failure.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.180]   But that's not true.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.980]   I was just reading a story last week
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.180]   about somebody who gets 200 to 300 visitors per month
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.420]   to their website.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.700]   But they're so highly targeted.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.740]   And the service that they sell is so valuable
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.260]   that they're able to make a living on a service
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.700]   they provide with just that level of traffic.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.900]   So you don't have to be a superstar
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.420]   to make money doing what you do.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.340]   But if you give up, you're not going to do anything.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.540]   You've got to stick with it.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.100]   And pivoting, we've mentioned a couple times.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.900]   For me, that changed what I do in multiple ways.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.060]   I said I wanted to be like Pat Flynn or like Financial Samurai.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.420]   But I ended up doing the freelance route.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.700]   And when I quit my job, there was a point about,
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.780]   I'd say, six months later where I was working a lot more hours.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.260]   And my income did grow from when I had the day job.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.140]   But it didn't grow proportionally for the hours
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.860]   that I grew.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.380]   And I was like, why am I working so hard and feeling more stress
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.900]   but my income isn't going up the way I expected?
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.620]   And me, with a finance background,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.180]   I opened up my accounting records.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.580]   And I was looking at them.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.500]   And I noticed that about 76% of my income
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.220]   was coming from writing.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.300]   And that was taking about 20% of my time.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.460]   And about 17% of my income was coming from website projects.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.660]   And that was taking about 80% of my time
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.340]   and causing about 90% of my stress.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.900]   I was like, huh, that's like the 80/20 rule smacking me
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.820]   in the face saying, Eric, you need
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.020]   to focus on writing over website projects.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.100]   So actually, that is what I did.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.700]   The next month, I had some recurring website support
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.340]   clients that I'd fix their websites when they broke,
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.460]   things like that.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.700]   And I told them I was ending that business
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.620]   and pointed them to a friend in the industry who I thought
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.660]   would do a good job for them.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:20.700]   And I doubled down, tripled down on my writing.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.460]   And the next month, my income did go down a little.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.180]   But the month after and the month after,
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.380]   over about three months, my income roughly tripled.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.060]   And that's when it went over $10,000
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.460]   in a month for the first time.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.220]   And it's almost never gone back down since.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.620]   So again, it was one of those places--
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.940]   it wasn't exactly what I expected.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.460]   But I noticed what was working in my business,
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.860]   refocused my efforts on that.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.980]   And if you keep focusing on what's working well for you,
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.860]   it should keep working well for you.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.340]   I like that.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.060]   Again, in banking, when we were approving loans and reviewing
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.060]   credit reports, we'd say past performance
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.980]   is the best predictor of future performance.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.020]   So if somebody was late paying all their loans,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.860]   they'll probably keep being late paying all their loans.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.300]   But when you're looking at freelancing,
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.820]   the place you're making the most money
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.620]   is probably the place you will keep making the most money.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.740]   If there's a place you're making more money with less effort,
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.740]   do that.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.940]   Don't work yourself to the bone trying
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.780]   to do something that's not working when something else is
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.740]   working for you.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.780]   So focus on what's working, and keep focusing on what's working,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.460]   and reevaluate periodically.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.580]   Big companies have teams of financial planning and analysis
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.620]   people, FP&A.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.180]   That's what I used to do.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.580]   And their whole job is to sit there and look
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.260]   at financial results and find trends, what's working well,
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.380]   what's not working well, basically.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.700]   And if you do that for your own business, which I say,
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.940]   everyone should keep really good records of income and expenses,
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.180]   not just because the IRS says so,
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.900]   but because you're the manager of your business,
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.700]   and you need that data to know what's working well
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.420]   and what's not working well.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.780]   And when you look at it and you notice trends, act on it.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.620]   Don't just sit idly by.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.580]   Like we said, you can improve that website.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.900]   You can improve your business.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.140]   You can refocus what you're doing.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.540]   It doesn't always have to be as knee jerk
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.460]   as I did, where I dropped a big part of my business
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.860]   and focused on another.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.420]   It can be more gradual.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.660]   But if you ignore those trends and ignore what's working,
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.380]   you'll probably just keep doing what you're doing now.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.140]   It'll probably maintain the status quo,
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.860]   unless you take some kind of action to keep that improvement.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.100]   No, I like how you're very process driven,
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.140]   and you look at the numbers.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.980]   For me, I don't really look at the numbers,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.900]   because they kind of bum me out a little bit.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.260]   Because I really just try to write
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.460]   whatever is interesting that's on my mind,
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.380]   or I need some help or inspiration from the community.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.900]   And I feel that that has worked with me since 2009.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.700]   But then if I start looking at the numbers,
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.540]   then the problem is I start questioning,
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.380]   am I writing because I want to make money,
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.780]   or because I want to connect and have a dialogue?
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.100]   And I'm trying my best to write interesting things based
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   on firsthand experience that is relevant to today's economy
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.220]   or society, whatever the topics may be.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.100]   There's endless amount of stuff.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.740]   But I do agree with you that I need to focus on the numbers.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.540]   I kind of outsource the numbers, ironically, to my wife,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.180]   even though I'm the finance guy.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.500]   Because I don't want to look at that stuff.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.340]   Because I've seen before where people--
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.860]   let's say they get into blogging or something,
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.020]   and they're so focused on trying to make money
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.060]   from that endeavor that they inevitably end up quitting,
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.340]   because they don't make enough money in the beginning
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.420]   to make it worthwhile.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.060]   It's definitely-- blogging is a long haul.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.340]   It's not a get-rich-quick thing.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.980]   It takes-- outside of extremely few people,
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.740]   most experiences with a blog, it's going to take time.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.580]   YouTube channels is a great example of things
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.380]   that it takes a lot of time to do well.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.500]   And I've known people who post a video a week, almost
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.380]   religiously, for a long period of time
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.460]   and have a little bit of traffic.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.140]   They get bumps and ups and downs.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.460]   But all of a sudden, two years later,
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.900]   Google's algorithm notices them.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.700]   And they shoot up and do great and continue to do great.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.420]   Does that mean that those first two years were a failure?
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.340]   Absolutely not.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.060]   That's part of--
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.500]   That was foundation.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.180]   --their assets.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:42.460]   Right.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.540]   That's their foundation.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.500]   But if they hadn't put those two years in,
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.700]   that big spike wouldn't have happened.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.220]   When I was able to quit my job and become self-employed--
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.820]   and I used to do income reports.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.580]   So my income jumped those months and went over $10,000.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.040]   All of a sudden, people noticed me.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.220]   So it was like, wow, eight years of hard work,
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.020]   and I'm an overnight success.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.940]   But nobody wants to do the eight years first.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.860]   It was a lot of work to get me to the point
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.100]   where I was an overnight success.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.540]   So once in a blue moon, somebody will start a blog.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.740]   And it'll get picked up by a major media outlet.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.460]   Or something will just work with their search engine stuff.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.020]   Or it'll have a post go viral on some social network.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.100]   And they'll take off early on.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.920]   But most people probably won't have that.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.520]   Most people, it's a slower process.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.800]   It's building a community.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   It's building a following.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.200]   There's a lot of interactions, a lot of emails.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.660]   You know you're doing something right when you start getting
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.440]   the hater emails.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.640]   You're getting to-- getting--
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.320]   rubbing somebody either the wrong way,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.240]   it's probably because they're jealous of what you're saying,
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.960]   or your success.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.400]   Or disagree.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.720]   And it's OK if they disagree.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.820]   That means you're engaging people.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.980]   So stick with it.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.300]   I have one of those personalities
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.780]   where I'll work on something.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.180]   And when I start seeing success in it, I get bored.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.620]   I'm like, all right, I did that.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.580]   On to the next thing.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.980]   I've never been diagnosed, but I think I have ADHD.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.740]   I think that's what probably causes that in me.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.380]   But because the freelancing thing,
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:25.660]   it became so successful, I just couldn't ignore it.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.820]   It wasn't-- it became something that I was like, wow,
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.160]   this can go beyond a side hustle.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.400]   But even when you have a full time job--
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.860]   I'm a big fan of side hustles.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.760]   Having multiple income streams, I think, is really important.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.720]   Because as we saw recently, people
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.120]   can get laid off any day, even if they're doing a great job.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.640]   Maybe you worked at Twitter, and you were an engineer,
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.920]   and you kept the whole site together.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.160]   You'd think that would be job security.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.280]   But a new boss comes in, and you're gone the next day.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.920]   If you have multiple income streams,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.880]   you at least have something else to fall back
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.600]   on if you lose a job.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.480]   And if you are a freelancer, I like to say,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.880]   I traded having one boss for having about a dozen bosses
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.200]   any given time.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   But if I don't like any of my bosses, I can fire them.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.960]   And I still have 11 more who are happy to pay me.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.800]   And it ebbs and flows every month.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.200]   I'd say I work with 10 to 15 companies.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.480]   And some come and go.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.840]   Some come back.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.680]   It's just the nature of freelancing.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.000]   You have to have a thicker skin than a lot of things.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.240]   But I have noticed a lot of people, when they lose a job,
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.040]   that's it.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.000]   They're like, wow, I need to find the next job.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.680]   Where for me, if I lose a gig, oh, well, I'll find another.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.120]   I'll find a lot more.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.840]   So to me, that's almost more job security.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.600]   There's expenses.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.120]   But it's a very different way of looking at income
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.000]   than when I had the day job.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.440]   No, I absolutely agree.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.600]   Yeah, start and stick with it.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.920]   For listeners, just as an example,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.760]   I started the Financial Samurai podcast maybe five years ago,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.840]   six years ago.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.080]   Not consistent three, four years ago.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.240]   But I've been consistent.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.840]   And I haven't tried to find any sponsors or anything.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.080]   I do mention some of the things that I've
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.640]   written and produced in the past or some affiliates on occasion.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.000]   But I've basically made no money from this podcast
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.080]   for five years.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.680]   But that's OK because I'm enjoying it.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.520]   I like talking to people like you.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.200]   And I have this 10-year-plus vision from now.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.160]   So another 10 years when my kids are older,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.440]   hopefully maybe they can come on and they
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.000]   can listen to archive episodes.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.120]   And it's just fun.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.560]   And I do believe if you don't quit and you keep on going,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.600]   there's no way that this podcast will be smaller 10 years
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.080]   from now than it is today.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.440]   So really, that grit and perseverance mentality
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.200]   is so important.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.880]   And speaking of podcasts, you mentioned
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.960]   that you have another freelance gig as a podcast host.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.040]   How does that come about?
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.640]   I mean, that seems so--
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.760]   it just keeps on going.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.800]   Yeah, yes.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.880]   I'm one of those people that if something comes along,
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.200]   I like to say yes if I could make money from it.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.320]   I always give it a try.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.400]   Of course, I have limits.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.680]   There have been big media companies
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.180]   that have asked me to work with them
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.920]   that I have moral disagreements with that I've
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.880]   been able to say no.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.400]   I'm glad I was in that position.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.480]   I could say no.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.040]   But with the podcasting thing, I'd had my own podcast.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.760]   I don't really add to it anymore,
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.080]   but anyone can go download it.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.680]   There's 120 episodes.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.880]   It's called the Personal Profitability Podcast.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.400]   You can find it anywhere you listen to podcasts.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.640]   And I was going to a podcast conference
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.000]   called Podcast Movement.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.200]   I've been to, I think, five or six of them,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.960]   got to know a lot of people.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.760]   So I got to learn a lot about podcasting just by doing it.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.080]   My first episode was not nearly as good as my 50th, which was
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   not nearly as good as my 100th.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.960]   If you go back five years of Financial Samurai,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.500]   you'll probably notice the same thing.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.600]   The podcast gets better.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.800]   We get better microphones, better editing.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.680]   We get more consistent.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.240]   We get better at interviewing people.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.560]   Anything you practice, you're going to get better at.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.840]   So podcasting, because I practiced 120-something times,
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.200]   became a skill.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.800]   And one of my writing clients--
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.640]   it's a company I really love working with.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   It's called PayActive.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   They do a financial wellness--
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.240]   it's a financial wellness platform
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.000]   for targeting lower-income hourly workers.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.560]   Anyone could really benefit from it
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.040]   if you ever feel like you're living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   And I met the CEO at a conference in LA.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.440]   They invited me as a media guest.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.320]   And we were chatting.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.000]   And he said, you seem to really get
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.280]   the idea of what we're about.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.560]   Will you write for our blog?
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.920]   And I've actually been one of their longest-affiliated
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.400]   people.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.960]   I've seen multiple chief marketing officers
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.040]   come and go over the years.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.520]   But the last one said, I like the blogging world.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.800]   We really need to expand, though.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.840]   We need to do video and audio, because that's a big trend.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.280]   People listen to podcasts on--
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.360]   you live in New York on the subway to work.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.880]   If you live wherever, you might listen to one on your commute.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.520]   Commutes are a really big place to listen to podcasts,
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.280]   or if you do any kind of driving.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.200]   I actually got a little podcasting speaker in my shower,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.760]   because I was just not getting enough podcast hours.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.360]   So I'm listening to podcasts whenever I can.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.240]   Yesterday, I had a podcast on in my ears
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.640]   while I was doing yard work.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.680]   So for me, podcasts are just something
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.800]   I've always loved and enjoyed.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.200]   And when they said, oh, we want to add a podcast
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.120]   and add an audio component to what we're doing,
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.000]   I put my hand up.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.280]   I said, hey, I've done my own podcast.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.920]   You can check out episodes.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.320]   I'd love to be the host and be part of the face of the brand
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.640]   even a little more.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.080]   And they said, sure, we'd love it.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.400]   And we've been doing the podcast over a year now.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.680]   And we've been able to interview some really interesting people
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.320]   and give really great advice, financial tips to people.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.400]   I think they're good advice for anybody,
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.800]   but we target them at that audience that we have in mind.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.680]   And I think we're able to change people's lives by the show.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.600]   So I feel good about it, and it helps me make a living.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.040]   And do you edit the podcast, too, or do you just host it?
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.160]   So I'm the host, and I found the editors, actually,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.840]   the old editor from my podcast from way back when I sent her
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.360]   an email and said, hey, I'm doing a podcast for a client.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   They want an editor.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.600]   Will you be the editor?
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.680]   And she said, sure, here's my current rate.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.880]   And I said, that works great if it works for them.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.960]   And I sent an email to the CMO, said,
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.320]   does this rate work for editing?
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.880]   He said, sure, and here we are.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.000]   And let's talk about-- you don't have to talk specific numbers,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.640]   but let's talk about, OK, how much can a podcast editor make,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.200]   and how do they charge, and how much can a podcast host make,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.040]   and how long does that work?
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.760]   How do all these contracts work?
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.400]   Yeah, so for editors, if you want
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.160]   to learn about podcast editing, I've
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.700]   got to throw out a name of a friend.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.280]   His name's Steve Stewart.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:13.480]   He is the leader of an online podcast editor group.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.680]   He's a cheerleader to help people become
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.420]   full-time podcast editors.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.920]   And most of them are freelancers.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.760]   Though what they get paid, there's a big range,
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.480]   depending on what they offer.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.080]   So on the low end, you might find someone
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.040]   for around $50 an episode, depending
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.080]   on how long your episodes are.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.920]   So let's say for a half-hour episode to a 45-minute episode,
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.080]   you might find someone around that range.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.920]   And for that, you'll get someone who will maybe cut out
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.480]   your ums and uhs and run it through a software tool
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.840]   to equalize the sound so it comes out nice
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.760]   and it doesn't go way high and way low.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.400]   It sounds nice.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.960]   On the high end, you can pay hundreds of dollars an episode,
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.280]   and that includes way more in-depth editing
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.480]   and equalization.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.280]   They might-- they have all sorts of audio editing tricks
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:08.860]   that they use.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.960]   We don't have to give a whole lesson on that.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.240]   And then they'll do the show notes.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.320]   They'll help maybe get a transcription together.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.280]   They'll make sure that the links are
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.000]   in right to the right places.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.500]   They do--
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.720]   That's a lot of work, folks.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.880]   Listeners, you've got to appreciate these episodes.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.920]   There's a lot of work goes into production.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.520]   I'm a one-man band here, folks.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.600]   So your reviews are what the rewards are.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.000]   So thank you.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.680]   So it's adding-- getting the fading right for a theme song
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.240]   to go into the beginning and the end.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.480]   There's so many things that you can do,
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.000]   clip pieces together.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.160]   You just got to pay money and find that right editor.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:50.660]   OK.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.840]   So if you find a great editor, there's
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.720]   a reason they're able to charge hundreds of dollars an episode.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.920]   Because they're creating a service that is worth that.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.240]   And if you want the $50 one, you'll get a $50 value back.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.320]   And maybe that's all you want or need as you're growing.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.640]   But maybe you work for a big company.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.520]   I've talked to a few big companies,
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.440]   like large investment companies who you've heard of.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.400]   And they have much higher budgets,
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.000]   but they also have much higher requirements.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.320]   So they're happier to pay a lot more money,
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.400]   because they want something that is good enough
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.880]   that they could sit down with the CEO of a Fortune 500
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.600]   company who's their boss and say, are you happy with this?
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.200]   Their requirements are going to be a lot different.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.520]   So they want it to be like NPR quality.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.920]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.300]   So when I'm listening to podcasts,
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.680]   I mean, I definitely understand production quality, intros,
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.620]   the music, and all that stuff.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.080]   But for me, at the end of the day,
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.620]   I just want to listen to the content.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.360]   That's like 90%, 95% of it.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.720]   And I know I have nothing fancy here on this podcast.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.600]   Maybe I will get more fancy as the podcast grows.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.760]   But it's that content quality that's the most important,
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.240]   to me at least.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.400]   So in terms of, OK, podcast editing, $50 to several $100
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.640]   per episode.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.280]   How about being a podcast host?
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.880]   Because I think that's something that more of us could be like,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.160]   oh, we could be a podcast host.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.800]   I can speak more eloquently.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.700]   I can learn how to not say uhs and ums, and research,
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.400]   and ask good questions.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.520]   What does that kind of range look like?
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.800]   So that one is going to also be a wide range.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.960]   I don't want to give away my exact contract.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.800]   No, don't do that.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.000]   I don't think I'm allowed to.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.160]   No, the range would be good.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.480]   Imagine on the low end, someone might
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.200]   be able to do maybe $300 to $400 an episode,
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.480]   depending on the length and the time commitment.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.040]   Wow, $300 to $400.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.600]   Oh, I got myself a side gig, maybe.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.520]   On the high end, it can be thousands an episode.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:56.720]   But remember, with that, you are becoming a face of the company,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.920]   a voice of the company.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.760]   So you're going beyond just putting a few words on a page.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.240]   Here, it's your personality.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.160]   It's you are a face of the brand.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.840]   It's becoming almost a brand ambassador.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.440]   I like it.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.800]   The podcast I do for my client, we record the podcast.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   I find the guests.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.280]   I do the questions.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.160]   I found the editor.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.600]   I drive most of the process.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.800]   And I also-- we actually use the platform we're using right now,
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.200]   and called Riverside.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.880]   And I download the videos for the show.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.840]   And they get that to make little clips
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.280]   to put use on their social media.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.440]   So yes, I'm the podcast host.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:42.240]   But then we're also in Instagram reels, and TikToks,
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.400]   and wherever they want to put their stuff.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.800]   Basically, once we record the episode,
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.360]   the audio and the video is the company's.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.400]   So I make sure they get a good quality podcast.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.520]   But then they can use clips of it.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.400]   They can take parts of the transcription
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.560]   and put it into their app that the clients use, customers use.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.040]   So they can do a whole lot with it.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.960]   But then I'm also really tying myself to that brand.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.680]   So they're tying themselves to me.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.000]   I'm tying myself to them.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.760]   So it's a bigger relationship when
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.520]   you're a podcast host or a video host for a company.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.760]   No, that's fascinating.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.040]   Personal brand, branding is very important.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.960]   If you want these gigs, you better
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.600]   have a good personal brand.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.160]   You better not offend people too much,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.960]   unless that's kind of the trend of the client.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.080]   I don't know.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.120]   If you think about the brands of just different creators
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:40.440]   who you might know online, there are people who are--
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.440]   think about the people you follow on whatever
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.880]   your social network of choice is.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.440]   There's so many of them now.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.200]   There's people that I follow that are always complaining
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.720]   or always being kind of cynical.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.160]   And over time, I kind of like, oh, maybe I
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.320]   don't want to follow this person.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.560]   But there are people who might really like that and find
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.440]   affinity to that.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.320]   But for me, I like positivity.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.480]   I like growth over being down on people.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.520]   I don't want to--
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.600]   I don't like complaining.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   I like growing.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.240]   So I like to follow positive people.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.840]   So think about what brand you want to build for yourself,
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.480]   and then what brands would want to work with that.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.800]   I mean, if you're just complaining all day on Facebook,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.720]   no one's going to want to work with you.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.640]   No one's going to want to be friends with you on Facebook
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   if all you're doing is complaining all day.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.800]   But if you're out there putting out
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.520]   helpful, positive information on whatever topic,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.360]   you can become a thought leader in that area.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.240]   Then brands might start coming to you,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.840]   or you might be able to approach brands
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.800]   and start building those relationships.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.160]   But you have to be professional and think about--
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.000]   we see celebrities--
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.680]   Michael Phelps, I don't know why he came to mind.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.440]   He won a bunch of gold medals.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.280]   Everyone loved him.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.720]   And then one time, he got caught smoking pot,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.080]   and he got fired from all of these brand relationships.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.640]   It cost him millions of dollars.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.080]   Tiger Woods, everyone loved him for a long time.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.120]   And then he cheated on his wife, and he got fired
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.760]   from all these different brands he was working with.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.840]   So it can happen to even the big, big celebrities.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.800]   The tolerance for bad behavior is
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.120]   going to be a lot lower for someone who's
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.560]   not a super celebrity like me.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.840]   So I definitely have to be thoughtful about what
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.680]   I put out there.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   I don't want to look like a drinking frat boy
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.080]   when I'm putting pictures online.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.160]   I want to look like a professional.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.200]   So speaking of pictures online, how important
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.120]   is what you look like, your image,
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.800]   online if you're doing a podcast,
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.520]   if you're a podcast host?
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.280]   And vice versa, I guess.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.400]   There's a saying, you have a great face for podcasting.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.520]   You don't have to be a supermodel to be on the radio
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.200]   or to be a podcaster.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.560]   But you do have to--
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.480]   I'd say in this day and age, you do kind of
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.840]   have to put your face out there.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.520]   That doesn't mean you have to be a beautiful person.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.640]   It means you should be--
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   Everybody's a beautiful person.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.360]   Everyone's a-- we all have beauty in us.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.560]   But you should be thoughtful about what
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.720]   do you want to put out there?
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.280]   What do you want to say out there?
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.120]   If you put a little video out on your Instagram,
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.680]   are you showing yourself in Las Vegas partying?
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.920]   Or are you showing yourself at the pool
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   reading a business magazine?
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.760]   I'm in finance, so that comes to mind.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.560]   I don't know.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.000]   There's so many examples.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.440]   If you're an athlete, are you going
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.880]   to show yourself at the gym working out in a good way?
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.960]   If you want to be a fashion person,
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.680]   you don't want to be in a frumpy outfit
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.160]   with your hair messed up.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.920]   Once in a while, those are kind of fun for authenticity.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.680]   But think about the trend that you're creating,
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.760]   that brand, that package you're creating.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.520]   A lot of work.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.160]   A lot of work upkeeping your image.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.920]   But what about voice?
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.560]   Because I listen to some podcasts,
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.920]   and I listen to the host voice.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.600]   And I'm thinking to myself, man, that's
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.280]   a little difficult voice to listen to.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.600]   But it's a successful podcast because
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.560]   of the quality of the content, and the guests,
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.600]   and how much value the podcast can add.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.960]   And then I know a couple journalists,
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.720]   or broadcast journalists, and they change their voice.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.600]   They change their voice to speak on TV
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.480]   and speak in a more professional way.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.640]   How much does that type of deliverance
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.720]   matter in terms of building a podcast?
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   I'd say it matters less than you'd think, but it does matter.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.240]   You said there are podcasts whose voices rub you
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.520]   a little bit the wrong way, but the show's good enough,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.840]   you listen anyway.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.760]   So if you have a voice that you believe
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.840]   most people find annoying, you could--
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.960]   if you really want, you could go to a voice coach.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.040]   You could work on having--
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.000]   sounding nice.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.240]   Something that I advise most people
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.040]   to do when they're creating video and audio content
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.480]   is to slow down a little bit.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.920]   People often speed up when they're on a stage,
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.560]   and the same thing happens when you turn
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.480]   the camera or the microphone on.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.280]   And when you start talking fast, you're harder to understand,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.760]   and you throw out a lot more ums and uhs.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.020]   For me, I've voice trained myself
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.240]   to do that less by slowing down and being
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.280]   a little more thoughtful in my speaking
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.760]   and how I approach it.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.260]   But in the long term, I'd say just practice.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.180]   Like we said for blogging, it's not going
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.320]   to get better unless you try.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.720]   So try your own show.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.800]   Try your own podcast.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.840]   Listen back to it.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.640]   We always hate how we sound, because we
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.800]   sound different in our heads than we do in our earbuds.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.260]   But if you practice, you'll get used to hearing yourself.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.800]   And it's good to critique yourself.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.440]   We're often our biggest critics, so don't
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.960]   be too hard on yourself.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.740]   But it's OK to critique yourself and listen
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.680]   to the things you like about how you sound
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.840]   and you don't like about how you sound.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.080]   When you turn that microphone on,
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.120]   try to sound like your best self.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   That doesn't mean be like Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.720]   and make up a new voice.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.920]   It means--
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.420]   OK.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.120]   I can pick on her now.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   Is that her fake voice?
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.600]   I don't know.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.160]   I haven't heard her different voice.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.440]   She has-- if you go look at some more recent videos
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.280]   after it was pretty sure she was going to prison,
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.760]   her voice changed.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.800]   I was like, huh, that's interesting.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.160]   So she has apparently gone to a voice coach
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.080]   to learn how to talk like this all the time,
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.280]   so she sounded more like a man.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.200]   But most people don't need to change their voice completely.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.040]   But if you try to speak as well as you can,
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.200]   you probably sound better than if you don't.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.800]   So think about that.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.720]   All the little things count.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.840]   The little things count.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.440]   At the same time, folks, I don't think--
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.920]   don't focus so much on perfection
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.360]   and being the perfect delivery.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.280]   I don't know.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.760]   For me, my personality has always been, well,
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.400]   if it's good enough, it's good enough.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.440]   You get it out there.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.280]   You can work on it.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.880]   Just don't wait.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.560]   So in conclusion, Eric, it's interesting to see your journey
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.240]   because you've gone the freelance journey,
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.920]   and you're doing all these different things.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.120]   And you said it yourself, you haven't been diagnosed,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.760]   but maybe you have ADHD, where you
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.360]   like to focus on many, many different things.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.960]   And it's part of your personality, which is great.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.400]   And you're doing things based on your personality.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.800]   And on the flip side, I've done exactly the opposite.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.440]   I've just stuck with one side.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.760]   I've just written three times a week since 2009
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.840]   and just gone that way because I wanted
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.440]   to just focus on my own platform.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.320]   What are your thoughts on those two different paths?
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.200]   And what is the thought process in terms of doing both maybe?
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   Yeah, well, actually, I learned something.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.080]   I think it was FinCon in 2013 in St. Louis.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.360]   I had this blow my mind realization.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.800]   I went to a session by a guy named Stacy Johnson.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.640]   He runs a site called Money Talks News.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.800]   And he said the only way to be successful online
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.680]   is to create a ton of content.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.240]   He was like, I make five posts a day every weekday,
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.200]   and we have our newsletter, and we're just
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.840]   adding more and growing more.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.520]   And that's the only way you can succeed online.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.200]   And then I went to a session like an hour later
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.760]   by a guy named Derek Halpern.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.440]   And he said, I post one post a month.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.760]   It's really, really long.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.360]   It's really, really good.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.760]   And I spend way more time on promotion
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.560]   than I do on creation.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.720]   And that's the only way I could succeed online.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.600]   That's the only way to do it in the current day.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.680]   And I realized they were saying totally opposite things.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.480]   And they were both right and wrong.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.000]   They were both right in those are ways to be successful,
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.040]   but they were wrong in saying there's only one way
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.360]   to be successful.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.280]   If there are-- you could be successful in both.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.560]   So some people, it's a volume thing.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.000]   Some people, it's a quality and consistency thing.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.880]   What's important is that you find
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.680]   what works for you and the audience you're trying to reach.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.400]   I create multiple articles every single day for different sites.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.080]   And for me, that works really great.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.280]   But I've spoken to other freelancers
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.200]   who the idea of creating more than two articles in a day
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.760]   is like their version of hell.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.240]   They're like, I couldn't do that.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.720]   That's terrible.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.360]   I've spoken to others who create more than I do.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.880]   So it's finding what works for you
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.360]   and finding the right balance.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.560]   And we've said a few times, don't let perfection
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.680]   get in the way of progress.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.880]   Don't have to have a perfect podcast.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.240]   You don't have to have a perfect blog.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   In my freelancing, I do try to turn in perfect articles
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:45.960]   to my clients.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.880]   I use a bunch of tools to do that.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.320]   But at the end of the day, we're all human.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.480]   We're not perfect.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.680]   AIs are even less perfect.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.320]   I'm hoping they'll not take all of our jobs at some point.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.640]   But for now, we need people to do things.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.360]   And I've found a way to make it work for me.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.800]   And with the getting distracted and getting bored of things,
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.960]   something I like about freelancing
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.000]   is that I get to focus on different topics all the time.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.400]   Maybe in the morning-- yesterday, I
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   wrote an article about starting an LLC in one state.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.920]   When we hang up from this, I'm going
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.360]   to be working on an article on the tax benefits of donating
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.640]   cryptocurrency assets.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.600]   So to me, some people might think
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.320]   those are horribly boring to write about.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.800]   To me, I think any business topic and finance topic
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.080]   is fun to write about.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.640]   And those are different enough that it's exciting to me.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.240]   I get to learn about different things.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.280]   I get to try different things.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.040]   I get to read and learn a lot as I'm
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.840]   writing and creating a lot.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.200]   So I found a way to enjoy what I do
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.240]   and make a great living doing it.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.480]   So I'd say that's what anybody should be trying
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.600]   to do at the end of the day.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.160]   Try to find a way to enjoy what you do and make
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.360]   a good living doing it.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.160]   And by focusing on what works and what you enjoy,
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.080]   hopefully those returns will come back to you.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.320]   Amen to that.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.880]   Well, it's been great chatting with you for the past hour,
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.560]   Eric.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.160]   It's awesome to see that you're doing all this freelancing,
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.320]   to be able to take care of a family, three children,
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.960]   a wife in Southern California, not too cheap place
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:18.720]   to live there.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.220]   Totally.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.680]   So for folks thinking about freelancing,
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.000]   I would just start with your first gig.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.880]   What are you good at?
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.960]   What do you like?
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.200]   Brand yourself online.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.240]   Start your own website.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.720]   It doesn't have to be generating a lot of content.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.240]   But plant that flag online and just go start.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.360]   There's so many Reeses out there online to make money,
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   to connect, and then build your brand and network.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.120]   So thanks so much again, Eric.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.840]   And if people want to follow up with you,
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.040]   where can they find you?
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.000]   Yeah, the easiest thing to do is pull up your web browser
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.880]   and type eric.money.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.280]   That was one of my branding things
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.680]   that I'm really glad I bought.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.600]   So type eric.money, and that has links to all the things I do,
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.080]   all my social networks.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.160]   So head there, and I'd love to connect with you.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.080]   You can find ways to send me an email
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.400]   or follow me on the socials.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.880]   And I'd love to connect and answer any questions.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.680]   Yeah, and thanks again for updating financialsamurai.com.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.600]   It was very helpful.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.480]   I know you worked hard on all these little nitpicks
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:19.120]   here and there that we've solved.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.760]   So I really appreciate that.
