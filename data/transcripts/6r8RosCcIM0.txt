[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Psalm 84.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.520]   For the choir director, according to the getith, of the sons of Korah, a psalm.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.740]   How lovely are your dwelling places, O Yahweh of hosts!
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.640]   My soul has longed and even fainted for the courts of Yahweh.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.720]   My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.280]   Even the bird has found a home in the swallow, a nest for herself, where she sets her young.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.360]   At your altars, O Yahweh of hosts, my King and my God.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.200]   How blessed are those who dwell in your house!
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.080]   They are ever praising you.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.640]   How blessed is the man whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.280]   Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a spring.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.200]   The early rain also wraps it up with blessings.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.080]   They go from strength to strength.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.280]   Each one of them appears before God in Zion.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.460]   O Yahweh of hosts, hear my prayer.
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.800]   Have ear, O God of Jacob.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.440]   See our shield, O God, and look upon the face of your anointed.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.720]   For better is a day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.640]   I would choose to stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than dwell in the tents
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.320]   of wickedness.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.120]   For Yahweh God is a sun and shield.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.240]   Yahweh gives grace and glory.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   No good thing does he withhold from those who walk blamelessly.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.900]   O Yahweh of hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in you!
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:38.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
