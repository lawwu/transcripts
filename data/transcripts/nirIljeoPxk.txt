[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   but like the fucking monogamy thing. Like I get, I'm doubt
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   people want to do monogamy. But it's always it's like 100%
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.080]   monogamy. And cheating is like always like the worst possible
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.920]   thing ever. And that bothers me. Yeah, I just wish there was a
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.540]   little bit of occasionally, once in a while, there's like, you
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.560]   know, we call it monoplot. My friend who yelled like monoplot
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.160]   every time there's like a plot line in a story that is could
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   be resolved by being just like slightly less monogamous. And
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.160]   like every pot's not monoplot, like you don't even have to be
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.360]   full poly, you just have to like have like a slight amount of
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000]   flexibility, like, oh, well, then just bring over for a
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360]   threesome. Like, that's not even on the table. Not only is it not
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.320]   on the table, but like, it feels like it doesn't represent the
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.080]   general population either, like, around 5% of people are
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.080]   polyamorous, and probably like 15 to 30% are like, will be like
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.280]   open to some kind of exploration, like a little bit
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.080]   of looseness, which, where is that immediate nowhere drives me
