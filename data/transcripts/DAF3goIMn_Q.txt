[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.440]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.720]   episode 196.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.200]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.920]   joined by my producer, Jesse, on a beautiful day.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.480]   Jesse, when it's beautiful outside,
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.400]   I always say we need to get inside quickly
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.760]   into a windowless small room surrounded by black curtains.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.000]   So mission accomplished to us.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.400]   We are getting no advantage.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.480]   I mean, for you, you're a golfer.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.800]   You probably see a day like today
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.520]   and think, "What a waste that I'm not out there
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.800]   with a glove in my hand."
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   I agree.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   I am golfing tomorrow though, so I'll be okay.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.600]   Yeah, it works.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.360]   It's a hard life we live here.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.920]   We were a little late getting started on our schedule
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.680]   because, as Jesse knows, I was stuck on a proof.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.920]   So I was working on a theoretical computer science paper.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.960]   I was getting some momentum in a proof, and it was tricky,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.120]   and I couldn't quite make it work,
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.800]   but I figured I could get around the obstacles
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.640]   a little bit more concentration.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520]   That is a circumstance in which
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.040]   it is very difficult for me to stop.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.440]   It's a very similar circumstance to be on a roll
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.480]   when you're writing a section
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.440]   of like a book chapter or an article.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.920]   It's very difficult to stop mid-writing.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.160]   But anyways, I was thinking about that
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.640]   given what we talk about on this show
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520]   because it underscored the degree
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.960]   to which concentrated mental work,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.240]   so deep work efforts on really hard cognitive problems,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.040]   is something we don't really understand.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.680]   I mean, it's very intense.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.520]   Once you get all of that context loaded into your brain,
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.480]   it can be very hard to stop.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.800]   I mean, I couldn't help but think
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.280]   as we were winding down to record this episode,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.160]   the ideal setup for working on something like a math proof
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.960]   or working on a book would literally be just to do that.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.520]   You gotta do that all day long,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.960]   and then you do nothing else.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.840]   That would probably be the ideal setup
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.320]   if we just wanna say what's the best way
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.440]   to get value out of a human brain.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.600]   And that, of course, is so far,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000]   so far from what we actually do
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.320]   in almost any knowledge work job.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.720]   So to me, this was just a parable
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.760]   about how little we understand
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.640]   when it comes to extracting value from the human brain.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.040]   And because of that, how bad we are at setting up
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.320]   our companies, our organizations
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.000]   to actually accomplish that goal.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.680]   And honestly, one thing at a time
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.600]   probably is the right way to do this.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.200]   I will say though, progress,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.720]   when talking about getting more focus into organizations,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.480]   on the show, and I don't remember what this was, Jesse,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.600]   maybe it was a couple of weeks ago,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.400]   I got a question from someone
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.480]   about how I would redesign university life.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.640]   And I had all these ideas, some big, some small.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400]   And one of the ideas I had was
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.120]   all of the outgoing communication, the broadcast,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   like everything that any organization
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.520]   in the university is sending
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.360]   that a professor in the university needs to read,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.040]   all of that should be consolidated
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.680]   into some sort of weekly broadcast divided by categories,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.640]   maybe pulling out at the top stuff
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.920]   in which action is required versus purely informational,
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.320]   have some sort of hyperlinked index or table of contents
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   so you can quickly jump down
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.720]   to the parts of the message you like.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.600]   And you get this as a professor once a week,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.200]   as opposed to getting 30 or 40 individual messages,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.560]   all coming from different stakeholders at the institution,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.240]   all coming at different times.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.160]   Well, I got a note from a listener,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   shout out to Rebecca, who said her university does this.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.440]   So it does exist.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.880]   So some people are doing this, this makes me happy.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.120]   I can see the flaw, I can see the flaw in the plan.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.720]   And I really started thinking about this more recently
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.760]   'cause my older two sons school does this as well.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.360]   They consolidate all of their communication
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.400]   into one weekly email.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.720]   And it's a lot less communication
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.520]   you probably get at a university
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.600]   and people miss things all the time.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.920]   So it's the problem.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.920]   So they have this one email and on page 17 out of 40
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.440]   is where it says, "By the way, on Wednesday,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.400]   your kids need to wear blue."
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   Or, "On Thursday, there's this thing you have to sign,"
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.240]   or something like this.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.280]   Things get missed all the time
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.480]   because it's such a long message,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.600]   but that's a problem that can be solved
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.080]   with a good table of contents,
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.320]   pulling out the stuff that requires action to the top.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.480]   Anyways, I was heartened to see
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.040]   that there is some nice innovation happening out there
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.820]   when it comes to protecting our ability to concentrate.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.480]   Now, we do have a good show for today.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.360]   We have some questions that have been sent in.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.720]   We have some calls to go through.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.280]   Later on, stay tuned for this.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.800]   Jesse and I are going to try to introduce a new technology.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.400]   Later on in the show, we're gonna do a
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.080]   Cal Reacts to the News segment
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   where I'm actually going to be able to,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.800]   for those watching this on YouTube,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.440]   to bring up the article in question on screen
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.240]   and annotate and highlight it.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.880]   So for those who are watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.760]   you'll actually get to see me interacting with the article.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.480]   Now, of course, we have a bad track record
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.120]   with introducing new technologies.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   We tend to get some gremlins in the systems.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   I don't want you to be alarmed.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.720]   I'm just saying there's a 50% chance
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.020]   that before that segment is over, I will be on fire.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.840]   Now, again, that just comes down to it.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.480]   It takes Jesse and I a little time
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.400]   to get new tech up and running, so stay tuned for that.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.800]   So all of that is coming up.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.760]   I wanna kick off, gonna kick off today's episode
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.800]   with a new segment in which I look at messages that arrive
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.160]   in my, I was gonna say world famous.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.920]   What I mean is famous among the small group of people
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.800]   who are longtime fans of my inbox,
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   my interesting@calnewport.com inbox.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.400]   But before I do even that, I want to briefly mention
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.940]   my longtime friend, Eric Barker,
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.920]   has a new book out called "Plays Well with Others,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.080]   The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.380]   About Relationships is Mostly Wrong."
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.200]   I've known Eric for a long time.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.040]   He runs the very well-subscribed,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.840]   Barking Up the Wrong Tree email newsletter
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.120]   where he does these exhaustive articles
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.000]   where he'll take a topic,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.640]   really understand the scientific literature on it,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.480]   and present to you the big insights
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.040]   from what people know from the literature on that topic.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.000]   It's a great newsletter.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   He has a podcast where he goes through these ideas.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.040]   I've been on that podcast over the years many times.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.160]   He had a really great book out a few years ago
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.060]   called "Barking Up the Wrong Tree."
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.300]   This is his next book.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.300]   It focuses specifically on what we can learn
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.500]   from the scientific literature
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.860]   about how to make relationships work.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.100]   Eric's a great writer.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.300]   That book just came out.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.540]   The week before you hear this, it just came out.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.340]   So "Plays Well with Others," Eric Barker,
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.420]   I suggest you check it out.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.980]   Dan Pink said the following about it,
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.960]   "Humorous and profound,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.940]   'Plays Well with Others' will revitalize your life."
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.660]   One little bit of insider tidbit about Eric,
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.900]   I think the reason why his books and newsletter
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.100]   read so well, and not a lot of people know this,
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.960]   he was a screenwriter
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.860]   before he switched over to nonfiction writing.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.940]   So he spent many years as a screenwriter.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.220]   So I think that construction
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.820]   follows through into his writing.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.060]   All right, so that is a unsolicited plug.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.900]   Eric is not paying me for this.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.580]   He didn't save my life.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.540]   I don't owe him $10,000 from a gambling bet gone awry.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.200]   I just like Eric and I want others to read his book.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.400]   All right, so let's get into our first segment here.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.840]   I'm gonna call this,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.080]   Cal Reads His Interesting Inbox.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.960]   So for those who don't know,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.260]   I have long maintained an email address
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.120]   called interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.740]   It's where I say you should send me
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.280]   any interesting article or link or book,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.640]   anything you think I might be interested in,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.520]   send it to interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.280]   I introduced that address many years ago,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.440]   earlier in the history of my blog and email newsletter
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.680]   when I got to a point in my writing career
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.400]   where I could no longer individually answer
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.800]   every email that people sent me.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.240]   I used to answer every email.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.440]   They were mainly from students back then.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.840]   They felt like it was an important part
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   of my giving back or ability to mentor.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.680]   Eventually the number of messages I got overwhelmed me.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.020]   It was taking hours and hours.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.640]   And so I had to, with sadness,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.960]   move past my habit of I will respond
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.400]   to every email I received.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.160]   Part of that was introducing this interesting address.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.440]   So I didn't want to cut off all of the cool
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.800]   or interesting stuff people would send me.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.720]   So I said, here is an address, interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.200]   It's really clear if you go and see that link on my website
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.440]   that I'm probably not gonna be able to respond to you,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.680]   but I will read what you send me,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.360]   or I will look at what you send me.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.880]   So it's a way I can still get interesting articles
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.560]   and tips from my readers.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.640]   I've had that now in place for years and years,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.400]   and it's one of my favorite traditions.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.240]   So I grabbed a few messages that people sent me
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.180]   in that inbox, and I figured let's go through them now.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.200]   So the first thing I want to talk about was an interview
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.680]   conducted with Jerry Seinfeld
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.420]   by the Harvard Business Review.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.880]   This is not new.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.360]   This is from 2017.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   This is what I like about my interesting inbox
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.240]   is people find cool stuff to send to me.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.440]   So hat tip to Andy for sending me this interview.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.920]   I'm not gonna read the whole thing,
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.840]   but I just want to read one exchange
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.000]   that I thought was particularly interesting.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.400]   So the interviewer says,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.520]   you and Larry David wrote Seinfeld together
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.540]   without a traditional writer's room,
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.320]   and burnout was one reason you stopped.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.920]   Was there a more sustainable way to do it?
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.760]   Could McKinsey or someone have helped you
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.640]   find a better model?
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.340]   Jerry then responded, who's McKinsey?
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.880]   To which the interviewer responded, it's a consulting firm.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.180]   Jerry then said, are they funny?
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.360]   The interviewer said, no.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.640]   So Jerry responded by saying, then I don't need them.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.120]   If you're efficient, you're doing it the wrong way.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.100]   The right way is the hard way.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.240]   The show is successful because I micromanaged it.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.400]   Every word, every line, every take,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.240]   every edit, every casting.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.600]   That's my way of life.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   All right, so I like that exchange.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.040]   I've heard that by the way about other successful shows.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.120]   So this was true, for example, of 30 Rock.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.280]   You know, Tina Fey and her head writer
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.080]   basically hand wrote together every beat of that show.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.140]   And the way she describes it was,
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.280]   it's just really hard work.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.880]   They had an incredible density of jokes.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.320]   If you watch a 30 Rock episode,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.280]   you don't go more than 30 seconds without a joke.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.540]   Everything is a joke.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.340]   That's a lot of writing.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.940]   Joke writing is hard.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.760]   Maybe it's not too hard to come up with a premise,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.400]   but to get the timing right is difficult.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.380]   This is hard work and they just did the work.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.760]   That's what made that show successful.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.040]   I like this general point that Jerry is making,
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.960]   which is valuable work is hard.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.400]   There is a lot of friction.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.600]   It's not very convenient.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.520]   It's not very efficient.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   That is an interesting point because it is running at odds
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.160]   to the notion of efficiency,
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.120]   to the notion of optimization.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.560]   These are two different things going on.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.800]   Jerry and Larry were not trying to optimize.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.080]   They said the reason why the show is funny
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.680]   is because the two of us just sit in a room
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.600]   and ignore network notes
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.320]   and just try to go until it's funny.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.360]   There's nothing optimal about it.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.400]   But it's in that friction that the heat is created.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.360]   And that heat in this case was a world changing show.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.880]   And so we have this interesting tension
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.160]   caught by that article.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.560]   Producing things of great value,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.940]   who cares about efficiency?
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.460]   Use an old notebook.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.400]   Come back to things again and again.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.180]   Dedicate half of your day every day
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.500]   to doing nothing but trying to polish this further.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.080]   Copy your notes from one thing to another.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.120]   Go to annoying difficult locations
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.880]   that are awe inspiring to do your thinking.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.660]   Be hard to reach.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.520]   Do not have really efficient ways
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.800]   of people getting to contact you
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.160]   and moving information back and forth.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.980]   Because you know what?
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.880]   None of that matters when it comes to producing value.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.160]   So I think that's important.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.720]   Not that you don't want to be efficient
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.280]   where efficiency is called for,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.960]   but it tells us let's not put efficiency or optimization
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.360]   at the top of the altar,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.740]   especially when it comes to adding value to information.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.700]   The core grist of the knowledge work mill,
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.820]   these are two separate magisteria.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.920]   Producing valuable things
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.800]   and getting things done efficiently.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.660]   They're not the same.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.820]   And we have to respect both of them.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.140]   So I think that's a nice quote from Seinfeld.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.180]   I also like the idea that he said, "Who's McKinsey?"
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.400]   Is he funny?
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.420]   I think Seinfeld run by the McKinsey Consulting Company
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.460]   would be a much different show.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.620]   All right, so I got another thing here.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.800]   Another article came from my interesting inbox.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.740]   This one comes from Joshua, hat tip to Joshua.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.460]   All right, this is from the journal Nature.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.780]   And this is actually a news and views column.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.620]   So if you don't know Nature,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.260]   this is actually an article
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.900]   that is talking about a research article.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.900]   So it's not the original research article,
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.540]   but it's some authors talking
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.860]   about some important new research.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.340]   Here's the headline.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.220]   Virtual collaboration hinders a key component
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.980]   of creativity.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.380]   So this was looking at Zoom in particular.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.900]   There's two researchers here, Brux and Lavaz.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.260]   And they did a pretty thorough study.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.440]   This was over five different countries.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.880]   They were using technology like eye trackers
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   and movement trackers.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.320]   It was a pretty complicated study.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.420]   And they were looking at,
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.780]   and I'm reading from the article here,
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.680]   two measures of creativity,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.100]   ideation performance and idea selection quality.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.600]   And they were comparing both those metrics
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.260]   when they were looking at teams that were in person
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.480]   and teams that were connecting over video conference.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.560]   So Jesse, I'll quiz you before I tell you the results.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.060]   We have two things here,
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.820]   idea generation and the identification
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.540]   of good ideas once they come up.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.060]   How do you think these compared between in-person and Zoom?
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.980]   So you have two activities,
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.380]   either they're the same between the two
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.700]   or one is better in one context or the other.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.340]   Idea generation, idea selection.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.260]   What do you think was affected by Zoom?
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.380]   - Generation by Zoom.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.140]   - All right, so you say generation.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.660]   Yes, that's exactly right.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.700]   In-person meetings result in better ideation performance.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.460]   However, there is no difference
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.820]   between the collaborative approaches
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   in terms of the quality of the ideas selected.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.160]   So that's interesting.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.420]   I'm not surprised.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.920]   I looked into, not this exact question,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.540]   but I did some research for both digital minimalism
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.960]   and a world without email about communication.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.620]   One of the key insights of that research
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.460]   is that there is a lot involved in communication
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.700]   that's not just linguistic.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.220]   So there's body language,
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.340]   the ways that people move their bodies in space,
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.980]   there's facial expressions and timing.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.540]   Some of this comes through video conferencing,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.340]   but not all of it.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.060]   And so if you're trying to work together
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.800]   to feed off of each other to come up with ideas,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.340]   I'm not surprised that when you take
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.640]   or reduce some of these streams of information
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.060]   that the outcome is not as good.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.060]   This turns out to be one of the hypotheses
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.020]   these authors found.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.340]   I'm quoting from the article here.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.260]   The authors think that the use of video screens
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.740]   limits the amount of information that can be shared
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.660]   between teammates during virtual communication.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.980]   The only other thing that came to mind
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.280]   is also people don't pay nearly as close attention
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.020]   when they're in a video conferencing setup.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.440]   I have email open, I have Slack open, I have my phone open,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.780]   I'm in and out in terms of my attention window.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.600]   You're just gonna get less value out of it.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.100]   So definitely something to keep in mind
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.060]   when we're thinking about the design of the future office.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.700]   There's differences, there's a lot of differences.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.660]   Keep those in mind.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:22.140]   All right, so I have one other item to summarize here.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.940]   This came to me from Josh,
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.500]   different than the Joshua who sent the last article.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.400]   He's pointing me towards a discussion paper
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.720]   from the London School of Economics
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   that looked at 102 different firms communication data.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.300]   So how many emails and how many meetings
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.320]   were going on in these firms?
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.740]   Here was the abstract.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.020]   This paper uses novel firm level measures
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.700]   derived from communications metadata
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.300]   before and after a CEO transition in 102 firms
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.940]   to study if CEO turnover
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.980]   impacts employees communication flows.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.820]   We find that CEO turnover leads to an initial decrease
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.660]   in intra-firm communication
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.240]   followed by a significant increase
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.740]   approximately five months after the CEO change.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.260]   The increase is driven primarily
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.820]   by manager to employee communication.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.780]   Greater increases in communication after CEO change
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.140]   are associated with greater increases
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.200]   in firm market returns.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.260]   So Josh is asking,
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.940]   is this repudiating a world without email?
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.420]   It's finding that after a CEO changed,
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.780]   if there was more communication happening, more email,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.760]   that company was more likely to do better in the marketplace
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   in the immediately following circumstance.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.160]   So I think that is a cool study.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.920]   Here's what I would argue, however,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.240]   just simply looking at email volume in this context
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.300]   is probably not the right measure of productivity.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.080]   The A/B test here that matters
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.200]   is hyperactive hive mind versus non-hyperactive hive mind.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.720]   If you're in a hyperactive hive mind oriented organization,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.900]   so most things are worked out
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.500]   with ad hoc back and forth messaging,
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.340]   and you don't change that,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.780]   all you change is more messaging,
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.680]   well, there's gonna be more things that probably get done.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.580]   So what's probably happening in this scenario
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.140]   if I had to guess is that increased email communication,
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.200]   since nothing else changed
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.740]   about how they structure their communication,
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.960]   increased communication was just a second order side effect
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.780]   of more active management overhaul.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.420]   So when you had a CEO change
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.560]   that had more email communication than this company
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.940]   that had a CEO change,
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.500]   that's probably because in the first company,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.260]   they're doing more stuff, it's a more active CEO.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.180]   If you do more stuff,
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.540]   you're probably more likely in that post-change period
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.540]   to have more growth.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.540]   There's a reason why you're making those changes.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.180]   So what you're really measuring there
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.940]   is just how much activity are these companies doing
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.660]   after they have a CEO over change,
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.980]   the companies that do more after a change and do better,
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.980]   which I don't think is super surprising.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.120]   Now you might argue, yes,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.040]   but even if you don't move away
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.080]   from the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.040]   more email versus less means more context shifts.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.920]   More context shifts,
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.600]   according to the world without email theory
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.480]   means people should be less productive.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.400]   Again, I think that's not a huge factor here
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.960]   because in all cases,
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.040]   I think everyone was already probably saturated
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.360]   with context shifting from email.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.880]   In other words, I do not think there is a difference
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.920]   between the companies that did more communication
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.960]   than the companies with less.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.940]   It's not the case that the companies doing less
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.740]   had people working long periods of time without disruption.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.060]   And then the companies that did more
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.980]   was breaking up that time.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.820]   I'm sure in all cases,
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.060]   people are checking email once every five to six minutes.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.180]   So once you're past the saturation point,
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.860]   you've done the damage for context shifting.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.820]   Everyone is miserable.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.420]   Everyone is in a state of reduced cognitive capacity.
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.780]   Piling more on top of that
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.540]   maybe makes people more miserable,
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.720]   but you're already in that hyperactive state.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.260]   It's not gonna make much of an impact
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.640]   on what you're able to do with your brain.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.340]   So again, the real test you'd wanna see in my opinion
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.100]   is a hyperactive hive mind firm versus that same firm
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.200]   where the only thing that changed
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.300]   is they replaced most of that ad hoc messaging
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.200]   with structured communication.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.220]   That's where I think you're gonna see a big advantage
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.420]   for those who embrace the ideas from my book.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.140]   So at least that's the way I justify that.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.860]   All right, so anyways, interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.860]   I always appreciate tips, articles, interesting things,
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.220]   videos I should know about.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.900]   I can't respond to most messages, but I try to read them all.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.780]   You can also bother Jesse at jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.040]   He passes along things that are cool as well.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.160]   All right, we have some good questions,
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.340]   but before we can get to the questions,
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.280]   we have to talk about some of the sponsors
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.380]   that makes the Deep Questions podcast possible.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.540]   One of those sponsors you've heard me talk about
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.500]   many times before and for good reason,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.880]   because I'm a fan and that is Blinkist.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.700]   Blinkist is a subscription service
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.860]   that gives you access to short 15 minute summaries
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.740]   of more than 5,000 nonfiction titles
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.500]   spread over 27 categories.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.220]   These summaries, which they call blinks,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.380]   can either be read or listened to.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.100]   So on the move while you're doing something else,
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.060]   you can get up to speed on some of the most important
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.980]   nonfiction titles out there today.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.020]   Now, the reason why I am a Blinkist booster
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.900]   is that I think ideas are power.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.560]   Books are the best form or best source of ideas
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.660]   because it's experts who have really thought things through
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.080]   over a long period of time,
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.980]   consolidating and capturing their thoughts
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.060]   in this one compact format.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.340]   So you need to be up on books
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.460]   to be up on the biggest ideas of the moment.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.660]   However, there's a lot of books out there.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.220]   It's a big investment to start reading one.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.220]   Blinkist can help you do that triage.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.980]   What I suggest is when you're interested in a topic,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.900]   read blinks from the major nonfiction titles in that topic.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.420]   Now you know the lay of the land,
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.760]   you know the major terminology,
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.080]   you know the big intellectual ideas,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.780]   and you can figure out which of those books
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.780]   is probably worth buying and diving deeper in
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.340]   and which you probably have learned enough
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.620]   from just the summary.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.580]   So if you're serious about reading,
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.740]   you should be a serious user of Blinkist.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.420]   Right now Blinkist has a special offer
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.380]   just for our audience.

[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.740]   We are also sponsored by ZocDoc.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.020]   So ZocDoc is a free app that shows you doctors
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.640]   who are patient reviewed,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.540]   take your insurance and are available when you need them.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.620]   This is a big deal when you're trying to find a doctor,
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.320]   you know you need that primary care physician.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.540]   It's been too long since you've been to the dentist.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.220]   You have that mole that you really think
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.540]   a dermatologist should check out.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.740]   How do you do this?
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.480]   How do you find which doctors are nearby,
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.680]   which doctors are good, which doctors take your insurance?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.720]   It can be a real pain
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.780]   to just start randomly Google searching.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.860]   This is where ZocDoc comes in.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.020]   It helps you find those doctors nearby,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.180]   see real reviews from real patients,
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.460]   find out right up front, do they take your insurance?
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.020]   It makes it much easy to find those doctors.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.380]   I use ZocDoc, that's how I found my dentist.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.380]   So in addition to it helping me find my dentist,
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.580]   it also simplified a lot of the paperwork
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.900]   once I actually started going to that dentist.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.580]   So I am glad ZocDoc exists.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.420]   It's one of these products that,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.620]   of course it needs to be out there, right?
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.500]   I mean, it's like an annoyance in our life
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.340]   is how in the world do I find a doctor?
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.720]   So I'm glad ZocDoc is there
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.700]   and I'm not surprised that every month
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.840]   millions of people use it.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:24.100]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.340]   and download the ZocDoc app for free.

[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:56.660]   Be cool if our promo code was also rhymed, like rock.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.140]   Our show was like something about rocks.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.100]   So ZocDoc.com/rock.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.860]   ZocDoc.com/rock.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.900]   It's good.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.460]   I'm getting my professional broadcaster experience here.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.740]   - You're gonna start competing with Brady for his contract.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.980]   Did you hear about that?
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.900]   Sports announcing contract?
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.860]   - Yeah.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.660]   - Yeah, let me tell you how that interview went.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.300]   They were like, Brady, we like you're well-known.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.860]   We like your insights.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.860]   We're not sure if you're gonna be able to be clear on air.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.860]   And Brady's like, guys, I can do whatever it takes.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.820]   Like, well, we got a test for you.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.820]   He's like, okay, whatever it takes.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.340]   Like, all right, please read this phrase.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.020]   Brady's like, all right, let's do it.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.220]   ZocDoc.com.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.340]   Like, all right, good work, Brady.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.500]   You got it.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.340]   25 million.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.740]   - 32 or 33.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.580]   - Really?
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.820]   All right.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.300]   - After he retires.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.780]   - Yeah, whenever he does.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.060]   You think he's a little bit of the needle in the arm there?
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.460]   Or is that all just his longevity?
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.020]   I heard someone arguing about this recently.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.860]   - Steroids, you mean?
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.660]   - Or whatever, performance enhancing.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.060]   - I don't, but I could see the argument for.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.860]   - He would say he stretches.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.700]   - Yeah.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.540]   - He stretches a lot.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.740]   - Does a lot of band workouts.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.180]   - Yeah, well, whatever he does.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.260]   Yeah, a lot of band workouts.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.420]   Whatever it is, it works.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.860]   All right, well, NFL, if Tom doesn't work out,
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.700]   let this be my audition tape.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.860]   ZocDoc.com.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.420]   I'll do it for half his money.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.020]   - Yeah, then he'd be making robo money.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.020]   - Yeah, yeah, I don't wanna be greedy.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.660]   I'll do 15 million.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.620]   I'll do 15 million.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.300]   In the meantime, that'd be a lot of Blinkist ads.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.220]   Get to $30 million or $50 million.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.460]   Oh my, okay, let's do some questions.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.700]   That's what the show is about.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.340]   My first question here comes from Ilev,
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.260]   who asks, "What do you think about doing two shutdowns a day
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.260]   "to add an evening session after the kids have gone to bed?
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.300]   "To increase the time I have with my daughter,
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.940]   "who's 1.5 years old, I would rather leave work early
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.540]   "and have a work session in the evening
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.700]   "after she has gone to bed.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.540]   "However, I find it difficult to stop thinking about work
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.260]   "in the period where I am with my daughter
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.460]   "between leaving work early
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.580]   "and my afternoon work session."
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.140]   So in general, I think having two sessions,
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.540]   time blocked out with a gap in between
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.820]   is perfectly reasonable.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.500]   There's a lot of people who do it.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.420]   I think we had a call on the show once about this.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.940]   It was someone who had essentially night courses.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.500]   That's pretty common.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.780]   So I have to get back into work mode
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.500]   because I have courses in the evening.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.500]   And so you have a work block, then you shut down,
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.340]   you do other stuff and you go back to a work block.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.740]   Completely valid.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.620]   A few thoughts about making that work.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.100]   Shutdowns are critical.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:50.100]   The shutdown after that first work block must be clean
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.820]   and it must be complete.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.140]   'Cause as you noticed, the persistence of work thoughts
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.180]   are only going to amplify
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.700]   if your mind knows you're returning to them later that day.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.580]   So if you're a little bit sloppy with your shutdown,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.720]   your mind is going to really push hard
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.540]   to get back to ruminating or thinking
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.020]   about professional endeavors during your personal time.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.020]   So you need a really hard, really hard shutdown.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.900]   Close the open loops, shut down anything that's open,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.340]   check your inbox for issues, and most importantly,
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.020]   look at what you're going to do during your second session.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.220]   So your mind trusts that you have a good thing planned
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.620]   and you don't need to think about it in between.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.140]   Be really careful about using your shutdown
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.840]   to do that cognitive behavioral training
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.440]   that we talked about with the shutdown routines,
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.180]   which is you do your first shutdown
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.660]   when you feel the urge to ruminate
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:48.060]   instead of getting into it with that particular work thought
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.020]   say, look, I did my shutdown routine
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.240]   after the first session.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.800]   I checked that check box in my time block planner,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.500]   or I said the unusual phrase like schedule shutdown complete.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.940]   I would not have checked that box or said that phrase
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.580]   if I had not actually convinced myself
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.460]   we were fine to shut down
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.940]   and we can wait till the next session.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.600]   Therefore, I do not have to get into this rumination.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.980]   And at first, you're just gonna be doing that
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.780]   again and again.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.900]   You do it enough time, these grooves fill in,
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.200]   your mind gives up on it,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.620]   and you're gonna have a lot more presence and clarity,
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.140]   a lot less of these intrusive thoughts
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.100]   in between your two sessions.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.060]   You really got to lean into your shutdown session
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.100]   if you're gonna have these types of breaks
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.040]   in between work in the same day.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.140]   I would also recommend if possible,
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.940]   end your first session earlier
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.380]   but what you're trying to plan for here
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.980]   is the total number of hours you're working during a day.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.940]   That should be a reasonable number of hours.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.620]   So if like a seven or eight hour workday
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.900]   is what you're going for,
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.900]   don't work eight hours in your first session
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.340]   and then add a few more hours later.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.820]   In that first session earlier,
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.900]   it sounds like that's what you're doing
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.140]   because you want that time with your kid,
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.340]   but make sure you're doing that.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.340]   What you want is the total sum of your hours
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.460]   to be reasonable.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.660]   Don't be thrown by the fact that your first session
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.060]   is ending at a time when other people are still working.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.220]   It's the total number of hours that matter.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.620]   That's the advice I gave by the way,
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.580]   the people who were doing night classes
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.820]   relevant to their work.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.340]   I said, pull back when your workday ends to be earlier
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.340]   because that's cognitively demanding work.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.980]   And if you were working straight through to seven,
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.820]   I might say, look, that's too much work and you would agree.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.860]   But if you work till five
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.700]   and then later in the evening do a two hour class,
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.060]   it's kind of the same thing.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.560]   So again, you want the total number of hours
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.540]   to add up to something reasonable,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.660]   even if that means your first session ends kind of early.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.420]   And then finally, be careful about how you divide your work
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.100]   between these two sessions.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.580]   Now this might depend on you
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.020]   and the type of work you're doing,
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.620]   the type of rhythms that work well for you,
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.020]   but maybe you're doing more hard stuff in the first session
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.620]   and you're doing less hard stuff in the second.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.660]   I could see the opposite working too,
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.460]   that you're really on top of calls and meetings and emails
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.660]   in the first session.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.780]   In the second session, you're working on just one thing,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.040]   maybe one thing deep.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.460]   That might actually be the best idea
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.780]   because you probably don't wanna introduce
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.720]   too many context switches or open loops
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.620]   at the end of your day.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.020]   So maybe that's the way you wanna do it,
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.980]   but be really thoughtful about how you're dividing work
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.720]   between those two sessions.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.980]   For your particular situation, I believe,
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.520]   I mean, you elaborated that you're actually a PhD student.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.420]   So the other thing I would throw out there
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.220]   for you to consider
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.960]   is just ending your work early and being done.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.640]   It's not that hard of a job being a PhD student
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.680]   in most programs.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.440]   It's not nearly as hard as other jobs if you're organized.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.480]   Most PhD students are not,
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.400]   but if you are organized, it's like a superpower.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.240]   So I don't want you to give up on this idea
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.920]   that maybe you could finish by three or whatever it is
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.960]   that you're aiming for and just be done and it's fine.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.400]   Don't add that second work session
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   just because of an abstract guilt
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.480]   that I should be putting in enough hours.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.240]   If you can get your work done early and if you're organized,
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.080]   I really think you might be able to do it.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.800]   Just have all that time for your daughter, for yourself.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.560]   Keep that in mind.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.880]   Your job might not be as hard as you fear.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.560]   - Can I ask one follow-up question for that?
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.400]   - Yep.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.600]   - Are you an advisor to any students?
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.920]   - Yeah. - Their PhD stuff?
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.280]   - Yeah. - Do they follow your methods?
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.200]   - I don't know the degree to which they read my stuff.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.000]   I mean, I think certainly they're aware.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.360]   They're certainly aware of my books
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.840]   and they see me on things.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.160]   - Has anybody ever asked you about it?
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.640]   - Well, so there's kind of a two-part answer to that.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.920]   So, I mean, I don't always get into that
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.400]   with my PhD students unless they want to.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.880]   But I do at Georgetown have an open office hours policy
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.760]   where any Georgetown student can stop by,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.520]   whether or not they're in my class or not,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.160]   to talk about anything they want to during the semester.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.080]   And a lot of people stop by to talk about that stuff.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.560]   So I have a lot of students come through
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.960]   who have questions about organization.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.000]   Career stuff is a big one.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.440]   It's like, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.840]   that book is a big one for the college students
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.800]   because they're trying to figure out
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.240]   what do I want to do with my life?
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.680]   I'm trying to make these decisions.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.640]   They're typically ambitious, hard-charging students
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.920]   'cause they're at this good school
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.680]   and then they're trying to figure out what comes next.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.480]   So I have a lot of students come through
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.240]   and we talk about a lot of these different types of things,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.760]   which is nice because when I was a grad student,
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.320]   I used to answer emails from students
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.160]   all around the country.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.280]   And then as we talked about, I lost the ability to do that
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.080]   because it was just too many emails.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.880]   And so the way I'm able to maintain that connection
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.960]   to one-on-one direct advice, which is important to me,
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.160]   is my open office hour policy.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.400]   That being said, let me warn everyone,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.360]   it's the summer now.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.000]   I don't run office hours during the summer.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.800]   I've had to tell three or four people, I think,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.040]   in the last two days who have written me students,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.720]   like, "Hey, can I come in to talk about X, Y, and Z?"
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.960]   In the summer, I'm a bit of a ghost, all right?
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.680]   I pay my own salary in the summer.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.200]   I write, I unwind, I don't come to campus that much.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.760]   So you'll have to wait until fall,
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.060]   but I do run those open office hours.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.680]   All right, so I have another question here
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.200]   that goes along the same general track as our last one.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.240]   It's about shutdowns.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.120]   It's from John.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.280]   John says, "How do I get back on track
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.920]   "to doing a true shutdown ritual?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.420]   "I'm in a manager role and my days seem to turn into chaos
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.280]   "in the afternoons.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.320]   "This is probably my fault for letting the urgent
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.500]   "get in the way of the important,
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.200]   "but the result is that I end up doing the important
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.860]   "during time I've set aside for a shutdown ritual.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.960]   "After a couple of days, doing a true shutdown
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.660]   "becomes seemingly impossible.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.480]   "How do I break the cycle of poor shutdowns
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.800]   "and get back on track?"
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.720]   Well, John, first of all,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.400]   I don't think you have a shutdown ritual problem.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.080]   You have a time-blocking problem.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.680]   So you're clearly not putting aside enough time
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.960]   to actually deal with the quote unquote urgent.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.180]   If I had to guess, you're way too optimistically
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.980]   building your time-block schedules.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.960]   You are putting, I would assume, very little time in
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.000]   for dealing with things that come up,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.260]   let's say through email or Slack or drop-bys
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.220]   that are urgent that need responses,
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.320]   or you're putting aside time for your email inbox,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.000]   but you're incredibly optimistically saying 30 minutes
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.560]   and we'll be good, where what you really need
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.360]   is 90 minutes or two hours.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.200]   And so I'm gonna suggest what you need to do here,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.700]   to borrow a phrase from the earlier days of this podcast,
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.620]   is face the productivity dragon.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.020]   Actually time-block the time you need
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.440]   to keep up with the things that are actually coming in
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.020]   and require your responses.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:46.520]   Now, here's what you will find at first, I will guess,
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.460]   is that you are going to be aghast.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.320]   Your time-block schedules are going to be 80 to 90%
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.100]   Zoom meetings, in-person meetings, and email inbox checks.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.000]   But that is just reflecting reality.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.200]   That is reflecting your reality.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.720]   So if you actually time-block all the time
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.760]   you need to put out fires,
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.680]   so that when you get to your shutdown routine,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.500]   you have time for it,
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.840]   you might realize that's all you're doing.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.360]   So what's happening right now is you're just pretending
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.960]   like it doesn't take that much time,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.320]   and then you spend the time anyways,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.400]   and then just blow past your schedule.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.680]   Now that doesn't mean you have to settle
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.760]   for living with that particular productivity dragon.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.800]   This can be the wake-up call you need to say,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.920]   how do I significantly reduce the number of fires
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.360]   I'm putting out in an ad hoc manner?
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.080]   How do I significantly reduce the amount of time
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.140]   I spend in these meetings?
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.800]   Let that now be the fire that gets you moving.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.920]   And this is where you can begin putting into place
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.600]   the types of ideas I talk about in my book,
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.120]   "A World Without Email",
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.480]   to move more and more of the work
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.640]   that you're regularly involved in
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.800]   away from ad hoc unscheduled messages
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   and towards more structured processes and systems.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.520]   Now we have office hours,
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.600]   now we have task boards for keeping track
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.760]   of who's working on who,
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.600]   now we have structured status meetings
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.880]   to do rapid updates on lots of things.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.020]   Now we're taking things off of our plate
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.360]   because we're more directly seeing the impact
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.600]   of our current workload.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.080]   All of these type of innovations
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.880]   that are gonna make work more sustainable for you
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.640]   require a foundation of clarity,
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.480]   and that clarity comes from facing the dragon
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.720]   and saying, "I want a time block schedule I stick to.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.520]   If I need to spend five hours on email,
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.460]   I wanna see five hours blocked out
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.500]   on my planner labeled email.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.560]   I want when my supervisor or boss comes by
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.400]   to be able to say,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.540]   'This is what you have done to me.'"
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.960]   Clarity.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.360]   Face the dragon,
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.200]   then you can figure out how you are going to slay it.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.840]   - All right, let's hear some voices here.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.760]   Let's do a call, Jesse.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.080]   Do we have a good call we can turn to?
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.920]   - Yeah, we sure do.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.840]   We got a call about Elton.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.240]   He's turning 40,
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.280]   and he's wondering if he should cash in on career capital
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.320]   or pursue like a hard grind.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.040]   He's been doing the job for like 15 years.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.280]   - Hey, Cal, this is Elton.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.480]   I'm a mechanical engineer.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.280]   And turning 40, like other people
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.680]   that might be interested in this area,
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.720]   interested in this question.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.200]   And division I'm working for is closing,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.520]   but I spent the first 15 years of my career
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.760]   working in a test lab,
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.040]   doing mechanical testing.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.320]   And now I'm kind of looking at
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.840]   some different jobs that are available.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.040]   I can keep working what I think are good,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.140]   hard, challenging projects
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.240]   that I can really focus on and really get into it.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.840]   But for the same salary and everything,
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.240]   there's another job potential
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.160]   that would then be a much easier job
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.440]   and kind of cash in that career capital
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.720]   as you've talked about,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.080]   specific in the material testing realm
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.360]   that I have just built up so much experience.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.360]   So at what point do you keep going after a good hard grind
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.120]   and hard challenges
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.600]   versus start to cash in on the career capital
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.880]   that you've built to then have additional time
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.000]   for other activities?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.400]   Love to hear your answers.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.080]   - Well, Elton, I think 40,
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   turning 40 is a good natural checkpoint in one's life,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.040]   especially in sort of the modern world
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.880]   of highly educated knowledge work.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.040]   If you figure out how much time you're in schooling
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.840]   and how much time you're getting on your feet.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.080]   By the time you're 40,
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.640]   you've had enough time to get on your feet
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.920]   to figure out what you're doing,
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.320]   to gain some capital and some self-awareness,
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.960]   and then to step back and take a breather
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.800]   and say, okay, what's next?
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.360]   As I've mentioned on the podcast before,
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.080]   I think midlife crises get a bad rap.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.800]   People think about buying convertibles and leather jackets,
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.160]   but I think we could have some better terminology here,
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.320]   some better marketing,
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.960]   like midlife check-in, midlife course correction.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.240]   It's a great time to change things up.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.680]   So I'm glad you're doing this thinking now.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   I'm also about to turn 40.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.040]   Jesse, of course, turned 40 long time ago.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:19.880]   - Long time.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.360]   - We're talking like two months ago at this point, is it?
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.200]   Six weeks ago.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.440]   So he's probably too old at this point to be useful,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.600]   but I'm 39.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.640]   I have not yet turned 40.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.000]   I'm like you, Elton, we're in our 30s.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.520]   We still have our lives ahead of us
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.880]   so we can think about this.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.160]   Here's what I'm gonna suggest.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.960]   Dust off your lifestyle-centric career planning hat.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.360]   And do that exercise pretty seriously again right now.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.960]   So as long-time listeners and readers of mine know,
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.120]   lifestyle-centric career planning is my theory
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.480]   that when you're trying to figure out
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.920]   what to do professionally,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.240]   it is easy to get tripped up on very narrow concerns,
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.600]   such as this notion that you're wired for a particular job,
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.480]   and is that job matching what you're wired for?
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.720]   So this is the whole passion hypothesis issue,
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.440]   the whole follow your passion issue
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.840]   is you're focusing so exclusively
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.960]   on this mystical match between work and your inclinations.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.200]   Other people get caught up on individual factors of jobs.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.440]   So income is an easy one
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.040]   because it's a number on a scoreboard.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.080]   And so you can see that number tick up.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.920]   And so it's easy to get locked into that.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.480]   Like, well, how can I get this income number
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.320]   to keep going up?
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   That becomes a game
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.680]   where you keep wanting that to go higher.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.640]   Prestige is another one.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.560]   I want more prestige, more prestige.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.800]   How much do people respect this?
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.680]   How much more will I be respected if I do this?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.560]   So it's easy to get locked into individual factors.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.560]   Lifestyle-centric career planning says,
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.480]   take a beat, step back.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.080]   Your job is one thing that feeds into your overall life.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.000]   What is your goal with all of this
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.760]   is to have a life that is meaningful,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.000]   sustainable, and satisfying.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.080]   So the right way to think about your career,
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.480]   at least according to this theory,
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.360]   is to fix a very clear picture
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.880]   of what you want your lifestyle to be like
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.920]   in the near to medium term future.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.160]   So now that you're 40, you can go through this exercise.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   It's gonna look very different
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.200]   than when you do this exercise at, let's say, 21.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.440]   You have a lot more miles under that keel.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.800]   You have a lot more career capital accrued.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.080]   You've also learned a lot more about yourself.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.280]   Maybe you're married at this point.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.200]   Maybe you have kids.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.480]   Maybe you're more involved
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.560]   in certain community organizations
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.840]   that you had no connection to earlier.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.400]   You have a lot more to work with.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.280]   So go back and do this exercise.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.320]   Five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.280]   what do I want my life to be like?
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.080]   And you go through all of the details.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.960]   Where am I living?
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.200]   What type of place am I living?
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.080]   What's my house like?
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:45.920]   Am I in the country?
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.760]   Am I in a town?
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.960]   Am I in the city?
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   What's my time like?
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.400]   What about my connection with people?
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.240]   How much of my life is connecting with people?
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.480]   Or is it in work?
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.200]   Or is it in production?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.400]   Look for particular case studies
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.640]   of individuals that resonate.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.520]   I read this profile of this rider
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.000]   or of this surfboard shaper
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.120]   or of this master of the universe CEO type
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.360]   or this nonprofit doctor, whatever it is,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.040]   what's resonating?
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.760]   And you try to deconstruct those stories.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.920]   What is it about this person's life I've read about
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.440]   that's hitting the right buttons for me?
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.080]   And you nail down this lifestyle.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.680]   You imagine yourself in all of the different details,
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.080]   what your day is like, what things look like,
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.040]   what it feels like, what it smells like, all of this.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   You get that so clear.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.200]   And then you work backwards and say, great,
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.360]   how do I get to something like that?
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.440]   What are my different options
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   for moving my life towards that lifestyle?
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.840]   And work will play a big role in that,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.120]   but now it's very instrumental.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:45.960]   Now it's very instrumental.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.640]   So when you do this, for example, Elton,
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.840]   in your particular case,
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.120]   if when you do this exercise,
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.800]   you find a lifestyle you're picturing,
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   does not have a huge,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.000]   there's not a huge component to it
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.320]   where you're whatever, selling a giant company
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.760]   or up in a boardroom making moves.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.600]   Maybe what you envision is you live near the water
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.280]   and it's quiet and you're building a boat in a woodshed
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.400]   and maybe you have your kids there or something like this
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.840]   and they're out collecting fireflies
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.920]   or something like this.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.400]   If you have a lifestyle
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.880]   that's really resonating that's like that,
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.080]   and you're like, okay,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.840]   I need some amount of money to do that.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.160]   How much do I need?
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.240]   Let's get that number down.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.840]   Let's definitely go to the job that's more flexible.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.000]   It's remote and flexible
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.720]   and I can live on the Chesapeake Bay.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.000]   And if I do it,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.920]   it's kind of nine to five or whatever you figure it out.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.120]   And you say, this can be very compatible with this job.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.960]   Or you say, what I need to do
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.600]   is really just keep pushing the skill
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.640]   because I could start doing that on a consulting basis
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.200]   and maybe work eight months a year
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.120]   and take four months off.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.720]   You begin to get very innovative
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.200]   in how you think about your job
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.480]   when all of it is instrumental
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.080]   towards a bigger vision
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.840]   of what you want your life to be like.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.600]   So that's what I would suggest, Elton.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.160]   Go back, do some lifestyle centric career planning,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.320]   see how work fits into that lifestyle
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.240]   and use that to guide your decisions.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.600]   Do not consider your profession at this point in isolation.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.520]   Do not say I have to consider just my work as my work
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.280]   and just focus on very narrow categories like my income
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.080]   or whether it's my passion.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.840]   Fit it into the bigger picture.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.600]   Now is a good time to do it.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.240]   Now is a good time to take all of that career capital
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.080]   that you have accrued over the last 20 years
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.360]   in the working world and take it for a spin.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.880]   Make sure that you're leveraging it.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   Make sure that you're gaining more autonomy
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.520]   over what and how your life is like.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.840]   So 40 is a great time to do that.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.680]   Tune up.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:42.800]   I'm down to, Jesse, I'm down to like six weeks,
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.040]   six or seven weeks until I turn 40.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.000]   And then I make all the changes, make all the changes.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.360]   Big birthday project coming up.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.960]   Birthday projects coming along.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.680]   There's some big, some potentially bigger things
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.200]   I'm thinking about, not all professional related,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.600]   but 40 has been a good energizer for dusting off
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   some more lifestyle-centric career planning,
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.400]   exciting thoughts.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.320]   Most of them center around me becoming
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.360]   a professional HVAC repairman, but I'm gonna crush it.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.440]   I gotta say, by the way, I'm joking because I talked
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.120]   about my air conditioner at the start of the last episode.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.520]   I've never received more messages on any topic
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.320]   than we've talked about on this show.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.880]   I received about people who are similarly obsessed
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.160]   about air conditioners.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.920]   It's like a huge issue.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.960]   We've talked about controversial topics.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   We've talked about really philosophical topics.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.920]   We've done topics that I'm a world expert on.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.440]   No, most messages we've ever gotten for a topic,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.760]   complaining about my air conditioner.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.080]   A fun fact about my truck is that the AC
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.280]   has been broken for 20 years.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   I'm not surprised.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   - In a DC that's a lot. - I'm not surprised.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.360]   - Heat work, so.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.960]   - When I look at your truck, I think this is probably
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.720]   a vehicle in which in the mid 1980s,
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:09.960]   a ranch hand was murdered.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.080]   That's what I think about.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.360]   That's what I think about in that truck,
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.000]   that the number of ranch hands on a West Texas ranch
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.640]   whose corpses have been carried in that truck
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.920]   to a ditch in the far pasture to be buried
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.640]   is greater than zero.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.080]   - It is in the queue to be painted,
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.480]   but that queue never.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.440]   - No, I liked your paint job.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.520]   You have the old fashioned stripe,
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.040]   the old Ford stripe.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.360]   Is it, it's like tan?
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.960]   - Yeah, they're gonna get, there's some rust and stuff.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.520]   - No, yeah, the rust is an issue.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.360]   - Yeah.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.160]   - No, I liked Jesse's truck.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.760]   And we need you to have it because when Elon Musk
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.600]   comes on the show.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.160]   - Yeah, I gotta pick him up with no AC.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.600]   - Yeah, we gotta pick him up with no AC in the rusted.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.960]   Actually, honestly, I don't think Elon Musk
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.640]   would even notice.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.560]   Zuckerberg might notice, I don't know.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.800]   Oh, well, I mean, look, I can't complain.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.480]   I don't think a lot about cars.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.040]   So I drive, the first car I ever owned,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.760]   I bought it with my So Good They Can't Ignore You Advance
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.280]   and bought in cash.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.800]   It's like a $15,000 2011 Honda Fit.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.640]   They don't even make them anymore.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.680]   It's a go-kart, a go-kart.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.840]   Like if there's not a parking space,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.080]   I will bring it with me into the store.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.480]   Like, let me just, I'm just gonna bring this thing in
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.320]   'cause I don't care.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.160]   But it's fine, I commute through DC on it.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.480]   So between the two of us,
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.640]   remarkably unimpressive vehicle drivers.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.000]   All right, Jesse, let's try some new technology.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.440]   I wanna do a Cal Reacts to the News segment.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.640]   We actually have the article right here on screen.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.280]   So for those of you who are watching this segment
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.800]   at youtube.com/calnewsportmedia,
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.360]   you will be able to actually see what I'm doing.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.520]   You'll also be able to see all the sparks and smoke
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.720]   when this goes terribly awry.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.800]   All right, so here's the article.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.000]   This was sent to me by a listener.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.360]   It's by Elizabeth Klein.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.440]   It's from February of 2021.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.440]   And it is titled, "A Catholic Response to Workism,"
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.680]   call in how to lose at life.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.120]   So this is a Catholic response to issues
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.800]   about work and overwork.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   Because I wrote so much about this topic,
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   especially in my New Yorker column last fall,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.760]   I found it interesting.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.200]   I'm not gonna go through this whole article,
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.560]   but I'm gonna point out a few points
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.400]   that are made up front,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.600]   and then I'll give you my reactions to them.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.200]   But let's start here in the beginning
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   with a couple key notes that are being made by the author.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.400]   So the author says,
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.680]   "For everyone, for the vast majority of humans,
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.000]   life is not very glamorous,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.040]   involves doing a lot of boring and tedious things
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.960]   like paying taxes or cooking dinner or sweeping the floor."
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.680]   But she points out that these everyday tasks
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.560]   seem in particular to vex millennials.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.880]   This generation, she goes on to say,
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.440]   has suffered from widespread ridicule
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.760]   for laziness and the inability to grow up.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.120]   But somewhat paradoxically,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.340]   millennials also seem exhausted.
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.220]   All right, so this is a common thing we hear,
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.220]   but I wanna point it out
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.120]   as part of the setup for this article.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.340]   She goes on to say,
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.780]   "When talking about us millennials' problems
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.580]   is that we are,"
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.380]   look at this, already,
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.780]   I'm learning this technology pretty quickly.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.860]   Or for those who are just listening,
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.260]   you're seeing me highlight things left and right
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.300]   that I don't mean to highlight
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.340]   as I learn the technology.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.620]   Elizabeth also says,
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.620]   "Millennials are frustrated at being unable to obtain
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.020]   the same level of material wealth
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.180]   enjoyed by their parents."
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.780]   All right, so that's the setup.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.180]   The article isn't gonna go into saying
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.300]   why this is or what's wrong with millennials,
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   but that is the setup.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.500]   So let me just start with this
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.220]   before we get into the why.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.620]   I will say, in general, I have heard this a lot.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.140]   I'm not super convinced.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.540]   The issue here is I say,
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.740]   almost everything being said here,
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.580]   I'm sure it could be said
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.480]   about just about every generation.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.280]   A lot of these claims are just made.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.500]   Are millennials unusually exhausted?
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.220]   Are we unusually vexed by having to do small tasks
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.500]   like more so than other people at our age?
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.100]   I don't know that that's true.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.740]   I know it's widely said.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.260]   I don't know that that's true.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.100]   What about this idea,
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.980]   which I hear all the time,
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.260]   that we're frustrated that our parents
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.540]   have more money and houses than we do?
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:40.340]   Again, I'm not super impressed by that claim.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.460]   What is the biggest predictor
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.400]   of how much money or wealth you're gonna have?
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.480]   Well, one of the biggest predictors is how old are you?
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.060]   How long have you had to actually make money?
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.140]   How long have you had to actually trade up your house
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.980]   three or four times?
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.500]   How long have you had to be putting money
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.100]   into your retirement account?
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.820]   So I don't think it's some unusual thing
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.900]   that 70-year-old baby boomers
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.980]   have nicer houses and more money
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:05.180]   than their 30-year-old kids.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.380]   And I'm sure that's true of every generation.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.580]   That, ah, my parents,
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.500]   who've been around a lot longer,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.300]   have more stuff than I have than when I'm younger.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.740]   So I just wanna lay out that foundation
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.780]   that I'm not acceding the ground
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.660]   that is made at the beginning of this article,
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.260]   not acceding the ground to this argument
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.900]   that, of course, us millennials
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.300]   are all vexed and overwhelmed and upset at our parents
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.340]   and worried about our prospects.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.920]   I'm not sure that exactly matches
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.260]   a lot of my day-to-day interactions,
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.340]   but that could be true.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.840]   It could be true for other people,
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.060]   but let me just start with that.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.960]   All right, so why is this the case?
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.820]   There's a couple options given here.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.660]   There's three points in particular that I wanna point out.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.660]   All right, so first, this article talks about
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:48.700]   Anne Helen Peterson's viral Buzzfeed article,
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.300]   How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation.
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.780]   She went on to publish a book about this as well.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.700]   The book was called "Can't Even."
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.340]   So this was an article that did a lot
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.460]   for promoting this idea
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:06.240]   that millennials have a hard time doing small tasks.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:11.640]   Here is Helen's argument, or Anne's argument, rather,
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.780]   all right, so she puts forward the idea
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.140]   that millennials basically work all the time,
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.540]   and then when they are non-working,
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.620]   they are busy trying to excel in other ways.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.540]   So she goes on to say, "Drinking enough water,
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.960]   "going to the gym or running a marathon,
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.040]   "eating at trendy restaurants,
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.620]   "and then sharing all these experiences on social media
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.300]   "for the perfect Instagram life."
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.060]   So I'll label this number one.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.060]   This is point number one.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.620]   We'll come back to that.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.060]   All right, second argument that's pointed out here
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.940]   about what's going on with millennials
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.980]   actually comes from the Ezra Klein Show.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.380]   So there was a interview Ezra did with Anne Helen Peterson,
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.100]   but also with Derek Thompson,
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.460]   who wrote an article about workism for the Atlantic,
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.240]   and it reiterated some of these big ideas.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.180]   But what was interesting is according to this author,
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:05.540]   this conversation took a surprising turn.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.380]   So here we go.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.200]   "Near the end of the podcast,
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.340]   "the discussion takes a surprising turn,"
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.740]   and that turn is towards religion.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:19.940]   All right, so that takes a surprising turn towards religion.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:24.940]   Derek Thompson goes on in that interview to talk about,
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:29.220]   and I'm gonna highlight this, but he goes on to comment,
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.860]   this was unprompted by Ezra,
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:33.780]   "When you are religious,
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.560]   "you do not require the social feedback loop.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.380]   "You do not need a public performance of your life
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.820]   "to make it valuable."
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.500]   All right, so let's make this our second point.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.120]   It's interesting about trying to explain
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.260]   what's going on with millennials,
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:49.700]   this notion that maybe it is religion that is missing.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:54.540]   Millennials that are religious have an outlet,
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:59.740]   this drive towards wanting to live a good life.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.540]   They now have an outlet for that,
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.100]   and they don't have to try to simulate it
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.880]   with performative action online, et cetera.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.640]   There's one final point given in this article.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:16.580]   This comes from the author herself,
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.960]   and this is the focus on capitalism.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.120]   So we usually get back here.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.400]   She says, "As capitalism has become the religion
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.780]   "of most Americans,
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.740]   "so the measures of the worth in our lives
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.920]   "has become our product."
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.820]   So capitalism is the focus here.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.260]   She goes on to elaborate,
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.700]   "My life has become a brand.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.000]   "This is why millennials can both seem to be obsessed
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.920]   "with work and not yet value hard work at all."
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.080]   So there's this notion of there's a capitalist impulse,
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.480]   we'll make this point number three.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.160]   There's a capitalist impulse that gets us
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.480]   to constantly want to somehow support our brand,
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.920]   and so we're not going to tolerate efforts
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.840]   that don't directly do that, and we have a hard time.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.160]   All right, so we have three arguments here.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.120]   We have three arguments for why supposedly
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.040]   millennials are exhausted
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.480]   and having a hard time doing even simple tasks.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.560]   Number one is Anne Helen Peterson's argument
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.200]   that we're always trying to optimize performatively.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.000]   Number two is Derek Thompson's argument
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.800]   that we don't have religion.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.920]   We're trying to fill that hole,
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.200]   we're not doing a very good job of it.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.560]   And number three is it's a capitalist impulse.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.640]   Okay, so what do I think about this?
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.680]   I think of these three options,
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.560]   the person who is probably most on to something
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.880]   is Derek Thompson, point number two.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.520]   So let me work through point one and three first.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.960]   I'll say why I have some concern about it.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.320]   My issue with Anne's argument
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.420]   that it's all about Instagram performance
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:58.240]   is that I believe that exists,
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.940]   but it's a much more narrow tranche
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.480]   of all of the millennials in this country
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.960]   that it might actually seem
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.500]   if you're someone who is quote unquote very online.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.400]   So yes, there is this hustle culture on Instagram,
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.480]   which honestly, I didn't even really know about it
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.480]   till enough reporters asked me about it.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.560]   So there is a subset of Instagram users
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.200]   that are all about posting these inspirational quotes,
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.920]   these get after it style quotes,
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.600]   these bragging about how much they're working style quotes.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.480]   There's also a echo of the subculture on YouTube.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.440]   In the student space, for example,
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.960]   there's these YouTube videos of people
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.360]   who will study on camera,
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.760]   usually time-lapse for eight, nine hours in a row.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   So there is a sort of performative celebration of hustle
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.240]   that does happen online,
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   but I think it's actually a pretty narrow audience.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.600]   Most millennials, especially as they get older,
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.800]   millennials are now in their 30s,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.920]   millennials in their upper 20s.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.160]   I don't know that so many of them
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.400]   are so plugged into their social media presences
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.600]   as the main driving thing.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   I think as they get older,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.120]   there's other things going on in their lives.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.680]   They're getting married, they're having kids,
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.640]   the more important stuff is happening in their jobs.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.760]   And so I've never been as big of a believer
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.440]   that we can extrapolate the most eye-catching things
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.320]   we see on Instagram to YouTube to an entire generation.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.940]   It just doesn't pass the test of matching
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.720]   all of the people I know who are millennials.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.480]   You would think if something is a very widespread trend,
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.600]   you would see it popping up at least
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.760]   at a relatively high background rate.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.920]   So I think that might be a little bit exaggerated.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.720]   Honestly, most millennials I know of a certain age
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.080]   are mainly just exhausted with social media.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.920]   Now, again, we might be mixing up generations,
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.800]   we have to be careful about that.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.560]   People still use the term millennial
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.120]   to mean everyone who's young.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.720]   It's no longer the case.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.800]   I'm one of the older millennials born in 1982, so I'm 40.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.960]   The youngest millennials though
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.840]   are in their upper 20s now.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.720]   So I mean, sometimes when people say millennials,
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.280]   they're actually talking about Gen Zers
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.560]   or talking about people who are in their young 20s
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.720]   or teen years now, that's a whole other generation.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.080]   This is the generation that grew up
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:06.840]   with a native use of smartphones and social media.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.320]   That's a whole different thing.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.600]   But millennials, honestly,
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.040]   I think there's also a strong thread of,
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.520]   they're on some social media,
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.920]   but it's not a major player in their life.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.120]   All right, let's jump ahead to number three,
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.000]   the capitalism critique.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   There's a lot of this going on right now.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.600]   It's like our entire cultural conversation
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   is hanging out on campus when the freshmen are going home.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.800]   Like everyone has taken their first
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:36.160]   sort of Marxist influenced, whatever, critical course,
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.480]   and now are confidently explaining to their parents
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.360]   how it's all bourgeois capitalist influence.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.360]   There's a lot of this going on right now.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.360]   We're going back to these sort of Marxist critiques.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.360]   Here's the thing,
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.680]   there's not like there's something new going on
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.400]   with capitalism, I would say, generationally.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.520]   So if capitalism was driving you to these issues,
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.600]   it's not that there's some big change necessarily
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.040]   that happened in capitalism,
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.720]   let's say during the last 10 years,
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.920]   that wasn't there 10 years before that
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.600]   or 20 years before that.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.880]   So there obviously are issues with capitalism,
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.600]   but I don't think it's the right explanation
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.240]   for what's different about this generation
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.000]   versus other generations that came before.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.840]   It is Derrick who I think is onto something.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.800]   I think the gap here, the issue here is a meaning gap.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.880]   I think this is an issue with millennials.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.680]   It's an issue with every generation.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.560]   How do you structure a good and meaningful life?
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.360]   I think most people are willing for a good
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.960]   and meaningful life to have hardships,
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.880]   to require effort, to require toil, to have ups and downs.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.200]   People crave meaning much more strongly
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.080]   than almost anything else.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.880]   And there can be an absence of that.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.640]   And in the absence of that, I do think people flounder.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.960]   And I think when you flounder, lots of effects can happen.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.400]   A lots of effects can happen.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.240]   So yes, you can get burnout on doing seeming trivial tasks.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.160]   Back in my student advice days,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.200]   we used to call this deep procrastination.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.520]   If you get sufficiently mismatched
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.560]   between intrinsic motivation
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.360]   and the efforts you actually have to do,
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.080]   you can shut down your motivational centers
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.280]   and have a hard time doing even basic things.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.920]   It's similar to depressive syndrome, but not quite the same.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.000]   There's probably a lot of that going on.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.480]   Clearly, I think there is exhaustion issues with work.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.440]   Where does that come from?
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.880]   Well, as I've argued, I think in the modern age
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.400]   of digital knowledge work,
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.560]   so we get more and more ad hoc, frequent communication,
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.880]   all the context switching as job roles get more ambiguous.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.440]   I think that's just fundamentally exhausting.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.720]   So yeah, I think that really is an issue
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.520]   that's going on as well.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.600]   I think people are hungry.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.040]   We see strong embraces
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.600]   of all sorts of theoretical frameworks.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.040]   For an academic, for example,
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.520]   to see something as obscure and complex
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.080]   as post-moderate influence critical theories,
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.960]   which is in academic circles, is like a very narrow thing.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.840]   It's not like most professors in the humanities
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.920]   are coming at their work from a perspective
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.840]   of a post-modern influence critical theories,
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.520]   but they have a huge impact right now
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.840]   in our culture at large,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.800]   that you have huge swaths of my generation
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.880]   that is quoting like relatively subtle,
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.720]   but 15 years ago would have been something
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.040]   you only would have heard
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.440]   in a pretty high level graduate seminar,
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.880]   pretty subtle theoretical frameworks.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.320]   And I think it's because it's attached to social justice
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.800]   that seems meaningful.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.280]   We're looking for meaning.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   We see that, I mean,
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.960]   you see it in a completely different context
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.520]   with the rise of conspiratorial thinking,
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.160]   the QAnon, et cetera.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.080]   Look, say what you will about QAnon,
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.720]   but you can't say you don't feel like your life has meaning
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.120]   when you are stopping pedophile rings
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.040]   that live in secret subterranean tunnels beneath the city.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.480]   You got something that you're locked into.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.000]   So I think Thompson is onto something
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.400]   that the meaning gap is probably
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   what's important for millennials.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.680]   What millennials need and what Gen Z needs
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.600]   is some sort of coherent story
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.480]   about how to build a meaningful life
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.840]   in the face of inevitable suffering and hardship.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.640]   I think that is where the huge hunger is.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   I see it in the Gen Z college students I teach.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.080]   I see it in my millennial peers.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.920]   I see it in the generations in between.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.120]   This is what I believe people need.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.680]   I believe this is probably what the issue is.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.520]   I think we see that hunger out there.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.880]   And I think it's what needs to be addressed.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.040]   Now, I don't know if the answer is,
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.360]   you know, this particular article comes from a Catholic,
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.480]   it's a Catholic perspective,
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.680]   and so it might say Catholicism.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.040]   I don't think there's a specific answer,
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.080]   like you need a religion to do this or this or that,
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.880]   but I think that meaning gap,
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.920]   I think that's a big thing that's going on here.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.080]   Universities aren't addressing it.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.280]   The baby boomer generations aren't passing down this
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.840]   to their kids very well.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.120]   They got too distracted with just having a family
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.920]   and living life and trying to figure out life
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.360]   in their generation.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.960]   Everyone has their own things going on.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.840]   And, but that hunger, I think that hunger is out there
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.360]   and there should be more people discussing
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.280]   concrete answers to that hunger.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280]   Not one, there could be many,
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.240]   but people should be thinking,
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.320]   how am I structuring my life?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.360]   How do I want to structure a deep existence
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.160]   in a world of both shallowness and hardship?
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.880]   So I think that's what's important.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.160]   And the reason why I emphasize that
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.680]   is that otherwise, if we look at
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.960]   some of these other things being said here,
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.800]   which again, have some foundation in truth,
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.040]   I don't want to completely dismiss it.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.920]   It's easy just to see this through the point of view
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.240]   of like, look, there's nothing these kids can do.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.440]   There's these other influences that are bad.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.760]   So you guys sit tight and we'll go write polemics
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.640]   and try to like change the circumstances
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.160]   that are making your life hard.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.800]   That can be really disempowering.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.880]   And I think that's a thread that goes through a lot of this,
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.320]   this sort of, what can we even do?
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.520]   You know, it's just culture and capitalism
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.040]   and the way our exploitative bosses
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.680]   are trying to take advantage of us.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.120]   And so we need to leave it to like polemical writers
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   to try to change the society and change the culture.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.960]   And in the meantime, we should just, you know,
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.480]   go easy on ourselves, get back on Instagram.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.760]   I don't think that's what's going to help people.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.120]   We need people to come in and demonstrate in their life,
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.880]   here's my structure for a life of meaning
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.680]   amidst inevitable hardship, mental difficulty.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.560]   To see these exemplars out there,
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.560]   challenge people to stand up
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.880]   and introduce some structure into their life,
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.960]   to introduce some pursuit beyond the arbitrary
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.800]   or in the moment.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.920]   There is such a hunger for that.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.420]   Anyways, I'm rambling, but that is where,
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.920]   that's where I land on that.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.320]   So there we go.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.800]   So what do you think, Jesse, our technology worked?
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.080]   - I think it's pretty cool.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.200]   - Nothing caught on fire?
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.000]   - Nothing caught on fire.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.660]   So we have two new things today,
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.320]   'cause we have, we put the boom in.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.080]   - Oh, the boom is awesome.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.620]   Yeah, so you can't see this at home,
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.480]   but I'm sitting at a big round table
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.120]   and Jesse's on the other side of this round table, right?
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.240]   So we're kind of looking right at each other.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.520]   Our computer that we run everything through
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.080]   is way off to the side.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.280]   So it's very difficult to see.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.600]   We have to look over at this computer
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   way over at the side to do anything with it.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.000]   Jesse has installed this crazy boom arm.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.100]   So we can now pick up this big iMac screen
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.540]   and move it right over here to look at,
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.980]   move it right over to Jesse to look at.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.620]   If I'm doing zoom, I can have it near the camera.
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.300]   And so, yeah, we're high tech in here today.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.420]   - It kind of feels like a completely different setup.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.300]   Feels good.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.120]   - I like it.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.540]   - And then with the iPad,
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.980]   and you're gonna be able to do some cool stuff with that.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.860]   - Yeah, so look, I'm getting used to this,
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.460]   everyone who's watching the first episode.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:38.980]   I wanna be able to diagram ideas.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.580]   I wanna get better at reacting to articles.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.520]   We're working on the tech here,
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.100]   but the point is the tech is now in place.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.060]   Now we can focus on improving it.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.180]   And this is part of why we went down
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.980]   the one episode a week for the summer
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.680]   is trying to figure things out, make the show better.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.940]   Speaking of the show and making it better,
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.260]   let's talk about some of the sponsors
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:01.500]   that allow us to keep buying boom arms
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.460]   and trying to figure out how to hook up iPads to our screen.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.560]   And that is Ladder.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.600]   So in our last segment,
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.800]   we were talking about finding meaning in your life.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.760]   Well, as long as we're talking
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.960]   about the preciousness of life,
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.160]   we should also mention life insurance.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.220]   If you're a millennial,
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.260]   one of those small tasks you need to do,
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.500]   you might be finding a hard time motivating yourself to do
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.120]   is get life insurance.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.320]   In particular, you need term life insurance coverage,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.200]   which is surprisingly affordable.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   Don't worry.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.400]   So how do you figure out how to find a good insurance policy
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.240]   that gets you what you need?
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.280]   It's not too expensive,
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.060]   but it helps you protect those that you love.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.120]   You go to Ladder.

[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.900]   Well, when I talked to them on the phone,
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.520]   they really emphasized the fact
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.000]   that this is the one product that they do
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.200]   and all of their energy goes into making it better
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.120]   and better and better.

[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.240]   where they've upgraded the ingredients,
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.960]   found a better source for this particular vitamin,
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   an even better mineral to throw into it.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.860]   So you can just take your AG1 every morning

[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.560]   of flu and cold season.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.400]   It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.240]   That's it.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240]   No need for a million different pills

[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.920]   All right, let's move on.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.300]   Now we got a question from Frank.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.600]   Frank asks, "What kind of processes you go through
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.860]   to figure out what projects to commit to?
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:47.120]   I feel that much of the conversation of productivity
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.920]   is around figuring out how to tackle everything
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.720]   that is on my plate.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.220]   There is advice on working efficiently through that,
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.400]   as well as ways to get some of the stuff off my plate.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.200]   This is all great stuff, but what about making sure
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.800]   that the work that I get put on my plate
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.000]   is the best choice for my skills and my goals?"
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.320]   Well, Frank, this is a perfect excuse for me
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.240]   to remind everyone about the productivity funnel,
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.400]   a concept from earlier in the podcast
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.640]   that I think is worth reviewing
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.480]   because it's very relevant to your question.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.000]   So let me see here.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.360]   I actually could draw a picture.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.560]   In theory, I'm gonna try this.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.620]   I'm gonna draw a picture of the funnel.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.220]   So here we have, for those who are watching at home,
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.120]   we now have the screen back up.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.120]   So just for those who don't remember,
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.120]   the productivity funnel has three levels,
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.000]   which I will expertly draw.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.040]   Keeping in mind all three levels
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.920]   is what's gonna be important for actually
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.240]   getting a good answer to your question here, Frank.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.840]   All right, so if we're gonna label these levels,
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:57.920]   what are we gonna get?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.800]   At the bottom is where we have,
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.560]   and people who are watching along at home,
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.280]   see, I have impeccable handwriting.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.680]   I'm still learning this pen.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.520]   I don't know, Jessie, what would you think?
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.840]   It looks like someone having a stroke
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.040]   because they were drinking too much.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.680]   And in the middle of that process,
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.680]   the drunk person having a stroke was writing the word.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.760]   So I'll rewrite it.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.760]   So what I was trying to write here
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.120]   is the word execution.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   I'm labeling the bottom level of the three-level funnel.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.000]   There we go, that looks better.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.840]   - Yeah, that looks good.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.120]   - With execution.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.780]   Above that, the middle level of the productivity funnel,
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:46.060]   we can label organization.
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:51.120]   And then the top level,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.640]   and this is where it gets relevant, Frank,
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.920]   let's just summarize, I call this different things,
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.240]   but for now let's call it selection.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.200]   All right, so we have this funnel.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.440]   Selection, organization, and execution.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.600]   Whoops, I just accidentally moved everything on the screen.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.640]   Not to worry.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.480]   Boom, now we're back.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.760]   All right, and so what happens is you have
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.040]   a lot of possible things coming into this.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:20.880]   Oh, man.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.680]   I'm doing all sorts of interesting things
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:24.840]   on my screen down here.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.080]   There we go.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.380]   Oh my goodness.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.720]   There we go.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.680]   I'm getting good at this.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.880]   It's not riveting radio,
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.000]   but I'm actually making a lot of progress
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.840]   on this technology.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.920]   So you have a bunch of possible activities
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.280]   coming to the top of this productivity funnel.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.520]   And let me just scroll this up so we can see it.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.760]   And then what happens?
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.960]   Okay, all right, so now I have the whole picture drawn.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.120]   Again, for those listening at home,
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.840]   I'm sure you love the riveting radio here,
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.640]   but I have a three-level funnel drawn.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.440]   At the top, widest part of the funnel is selection.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.240]   The middle level of the funnel is organization.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.320]   At the bottom is execution.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.880]   And there's a bunch of stuff coming
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.720]   in the top of the funnel.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.520]   These are potential activities.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.920]   So when it comes to productivity,
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.760]   there's three parts to it.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.360]   Selection is actually trying to figure out
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.840]   of these things that are incoming,
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.160]   of these things that are incoming to the funnel,
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.600]   which of them am I actually going to bring into my system
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.720]   and actually hope to execute at some point?
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.400]   So a lot of the things coming in
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.800]   get blocked right at this point.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.560]   We'll talk about more about this in a second, Frank,
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.920]   because it's at the core of your question.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.000]   But just so you know how these pieces fit together,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.600]   the things that make it through selection
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.880]   then have to be organized.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.520]   So where are they kept track of?
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.040]   Where's the information associated
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.320]   with them getting track of?
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.880]   Where is the plans that may lay out how they're executed?
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.160]   When do those plans get made?
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.960]   How do those plans get consulted?
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.480]   What role do they have in their life?
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.400]   All of that happens within organization.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.280]   So for example, this is where you'll have capture systems.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.560]   This is where you're gonna have
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.080]   your quarterly, weekly planning,
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.560]   your quarterly, weekly, daily planning,
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.640]   where you're figuring out big picture plans,
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.840]   that goes down to a weekly plan.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.240]   You figure out what you'll be doing each day.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.680]   So there's a lot of work that goes into
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   organizing what's on your plate.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.400]   And then often missed is the bottom,
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.840]   smallest level of the funnel, which is execution.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.360]   We figure out, well, now that I know
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.160]   what I'm supposed to be doing right now, how do I do it?
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.760]   Okay, and this is where things like
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.360]   deep work or the shallow work, minimizing context,
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.720]   switching rituals, locations, scheduling philosophies,
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.240]   all the things you do to actually execute your work
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.280]   at the highest level, that goes there.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.760]   This is also where tools that make you more efficient
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.120]   when you're doing shallow tasks
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.640]   that would benefit from efficiency,
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.360]   they would go here as well.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.320]   All three of these go into this big picture idea
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.640]   of productivity.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.200]   Now, Frank, based on your question,
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.760]   you're focusing when you think about productivity
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.360]   mainly on the middle level organization.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.840]   A lot of people make that same distinction.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.640]   So the nuts and bolts of how I keep track of and schedule
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.800]   and organize everything on my plate,
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.440]   people often think about that's what productivity means,
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.800]   but that's just the middle part.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.960]   You need it, without it, it's chaos.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.360]   You're the list reactive method,
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.840]   just pulling things off of your inbox
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.920]   and trying to keep your head above water.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.000]   But it is not by itself gonna give you a complete approach
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.220]   to being productive.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:18.120]   That is having a transition from possible inputs to outputs
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   that matches whatever criteria are important to you.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.680]   You're gonna need that activity selection
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.240]   to come in place first.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.000]   So what I'm trying to do here with this funnel, Frank,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.280]   is emphasize that figuring out
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.880]   what to bring onto your plate or not
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.480]   should be at the core of any thinking about productivity.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.520]   And this is deep thinking.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.400]   I mean, this is figuring out like,
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.560]   what do I do for a living?
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.720]   What is my role?
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.760]   What are the things I'm gonna focus on in my role?
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.300]   What are the things that are overwhelming me?
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.560]   What is the work volume I can actually manage?
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.480]   And where am I now?
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.360]   And am I beyond it?
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.280]   And how do I figure out how not to go beyond it?
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.880]   This is where you have the hard conversations with your boss.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.480]   It's where you do deep to shallow work tracking
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.600]   and use those metrics to say,
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.120]   this is too much on my plate.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.560]   It's where when you move something
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.360]   from just individual messages
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.120]   in which work is implicitly attached,
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.460]   you move over towards something transparent,
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.560]   like a task board,
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.320]   where you can see all of the work that needs to be done
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.060]   and who's doing what.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.840]   So you can point to that and say,
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.520]   look at how overloaded this is.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.380]   This is where you, when you switch from push to pull,
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:15.660]   okay, I have another free slot.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.080]   Hey, everyone, what should I do next?
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.880]   As opposed to just send me stuff
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.680]   when you think of it and I'll take care of it.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.880]   All of these things fall
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.520]   under the rubric of activity selection.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.480]   And it is the part of the funnel
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.920]   that gets the least amount of attention.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.280]   Organization is like the meaty, sexy stuff, right?
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.000]   Oh my God, I have my notion thing set up
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.160]   and I'm using Trello in the sophisticated way.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.420]   And I have these different planners.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.400]   That's like the meaty productivity prawn stuff.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.480]   Execution, that bottom part of the funnel,
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.960]   that's the real fun stuff.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.000]   That's the, you know, I built my deep work shed
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.620]   and I go through the hike through the woods.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.080]   That's really fulfilling and fun.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.520]   It's the try to in the moment
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.080]   getting the most out of your work.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.880]   But activity selection gets ignored.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.960]   Even though it's the very top of the funnel.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.120]   So it impacts everything that comes below.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.000]   It's what gets ignored.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.780]   And a lot of the issues we have right now,
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:07.040]   I think in knowledge work,
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.800]   the burnout issues, the overload issues,
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.660]   all comes from ignoring activity selection.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:15.680]   And instead just letting stuff fly at us randomly,
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.660]   doing our best to keep our head above water
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.680]   and occasionally calling uncle
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.420]   when it becomes too hard to stay afloat.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.640]   So Frank, I want you to emphasize activity selection.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.520]   I want to encourage you to keep in mind that this is hard.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.360]   I want to underscore the notion
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.660]   that there's many different things that go into
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:36.620]   trying to figure out that activity selection
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:37.460]   piece of your funnel.
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:38.660]   It's not just a simple strategy
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.060]   you can put into place tomorrow,
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.460]   but I'm glad you're thinking about it.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.620]   And it's what you really need to be focusing on.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:49.220]   I'm getting better at this, Jesse, I would say.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.420]   I still have quite a few bumps in my pen handling,
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.900]   but I like this tablet.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.100]   And also I'm a fantastic artist.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.660]   I think people who are listening
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:18:59.980]   and not watching the YouTube video,
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:00.900]   so they can't confirm this.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.540]   Let me just say what I drew,
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.060]   the productivity funnel was beautiful,
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.780]   perfectly proportional, well-shaded.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.940]   My handwriting is fantastic.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.620]   And for those who can see this on the video,
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.300]   don't tell them, that's not nearly true.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.540]   - Related to golf, it's like,
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.340]   but you're also like using other people's clubs.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.060]   So like once you get your Apple Pen,
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.820]   you'll be, you know, cruising.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.660]   - That's true.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.180]   So I teach with the same software.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.180]   So when I teach in the classroom,
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:32.700]   I was a blackboard teacher
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.300]   because I do theory and mathematics
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.100]   and I don't want to show PowerPoint slides.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.240]   There's a natural pacing to writing,
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.780]   but my handwriting is very bad.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.620]   And a lot of the chalkboards at Georgetown are no good.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.980]   They're pitted, so you erase them once
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.340]   and the whole thing is white.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.020]   And so I figured out it was really the pandemic
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.220]   that forced me to switch over to this technology.
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.180]   During the pandemic,
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.460]   I began when we were doing Zoom teaching
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.340]   using my iPad as a whiteboard.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.820]   And then I would share the screen on Zoom.
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:02.220]   And so then when we got back into the classroom last year,
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.100]   I realized, oh, I could project my iPad
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.340]   on the big screen at the front of the room.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.160]   And so now I'm writing on my iPad,
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.600]   but it's projected up on the big screen.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.580]   So it's equivalent to me writing on a big whiteboard,
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.520]   except for it's on my iPad and I can save all the notes
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.800]   and send them to the students.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.760]   And I can scroll and go back to things I wrote before.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:24.540]   So we're using the exact same setup here for the show.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:25.520]   So you think I'd be quicker at it,
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.720]   but I am using Jesse's pen.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.840]   - Yeah, which isn't as good as your pen.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.660]   - That's true.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:30.840]   - I have a good pen.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.720]   - All right, what do we have here?
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.560]   Ooh, 120.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.720]   Let's do one more quick question, Jesse,
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.960]   and then we'll call it quits.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.680]   This last one comes from Oscar.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.780]   Oscar asks, "How should I organize my circle of friends
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.000]   "and acquaintances in order to make them stop texting me
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.620]   "via WhatsApp?"
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:49.460]   I'm gonna give you three suggestions, Oscar.
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:50.980]   All of these suggestions are gonna be built
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.460]   on this foundational observation
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.220]   that I make in my book, "Digital Minimalism,"
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:57.820]   which is that this is actually the area
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.900]   in your personal technology life
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.620]   that is the hardest to change.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.820]   By hardest, I mean the area
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.700]   where you're gonna get the most pushback.
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.480]   People worry about social media.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.880]   Oh, if as part of becoming a digital minimalist,
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.640]   I stop using social media as much,
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.880]   all of these bad things might happen.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.920]   I'm not gonna be able to grow my business.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.480]   People are gonna miss me and worry, where are you?
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.440]   I'm gonna disappear from the public discourse,
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.280]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.120]   But in reality, when people embrace minimalism,
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.920]   it's text messaging, instant messaging,
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.920]   back and forth conversations with people they know on apps.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.360]   That's the hardest place to change their behavior.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.700]   They leave Twitter, no one notices.
[01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.420]   They leave WhatsApp,
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.180]   and a private investigator's knocking at their door
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.920]   with a corpse-sniffing dog.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.260]   So let me just make that the foundation.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.420]   I feel your pain, Oscar.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:47.460]   But I'm gonna give you three ways
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.700]   to make this transition away
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.900]   from constant WhatsApp accessibility.
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.620]   Three suggestions to give you.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:59.580]   One, I would say apologize instead of instructing.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.380]   So instead of trying to instruct people,
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.900]   okay, everyone in my family, okay, all my friends,
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.420]   here's how I'm using WhatsApp now.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.580]   Here's the right way to get in touch with me.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.240]   Everyone will get defensive.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.060]   It's the guy with his one-day AA chip
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.860]   going to the bar and lecturing about alcohol.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.460]   People are gonna get defensive.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.980]   So I would say instead, just switch to your new rules
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.180]   for using instant messengers, whatever those rules are,
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.120]   and apologize when people complain.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.900]   You just simply get ready to say a bunch at first.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.540]   Oh, sorry, yeah, I don't keep WhatsApp open
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.820]   when I'm working on work,
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.660]   or I don't keep WhatsApp open when I'm exercising.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.540]   Whatever it is, just keep apologizing, right?
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.980]   And people will eventually get it.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.540]   Like, oh, I guess Oscar doesn't keep WhatsApp open,
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.900]   so I cannot expect that if I send him something,
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.420]   he's gonna get back to me right away.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.260]   They're not defensive
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.980]   because you're not telling them that's better.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:51.820]   They're not defensive
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.460]   because you're not telling them, don't bother me.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.660]   You're apologizing.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.460]   But the apology is sneaky, sneaky effective,
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:01.180]   because even if it annoys them,
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.260]   that they can't reach you
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.740]   because you don't keep WhatsApp open at work,
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.620]   it's a hard argument for them to make,
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.300]   hey, Oscar, no, no, that's unacceptable.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.980]   You need to be monitoring WhatsApp at work.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.260]   When they actually put in the words what they're doing
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.380]   and what in the moment they're hoping you would be doing,
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.800]   it seems somewhat absurd, and so they don't.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.580]   Two, provide a higher friction emergency option.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.020]   This is actually an idea that came up.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.860]   We called it escape valves in my book, "A World Without Email."
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.700]   By the way, I don't know why I use this royal we.
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.740]   Have you noticed this, Jessie?
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.460]   I've noticed this more and more,
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.780]   podcasts and videos,
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.000]   there's this real temptation to use we,
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.060]   even when it's not we.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:45.100]   I guess it makes it seem like everyone has big teams
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.060]   or seems more important,
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.420]   but I don't think it actually works.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:49.740]   I think it just sounds weird, but look, I just did it there.
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:53.220]   I said, in "A World Without Email," we,
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.660]   there's no we, it's a book I wrote.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:57.620]   There's not a team of crack scientists
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.460]   that got together to put together this book.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.060]   So I'm trying to be better about that.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.140]   Or if I'm talking about this show,
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.820]   I'll just say like Jessie and I,
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.260]   'cause I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:07.580]   There's a lot of that goes on now.
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:08.780]   Podcasters, YouTubers,
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:10.920]   they all wanna emphasize their teams.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.700]   Like there's some large office building
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.760]   that all their workers are in.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.580]   Anyways, in my book, "A World Without Email,"
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.260]   when I was talking about,
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.700]   it's a slightly different context,
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:29.020]   but people reworking professional communication protocols
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.500]   so that there's less ad hoc messaging.
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.700]   I talked a lot about the importance of an escape valve.
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:40.180]   So you give people a way that they can contact you
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.540]   and get an immediate answer in the case of an emergency,
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.580]   but it's a higher friction solution.
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.540]   So like you have to call me, right?
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.660]   Something that's higher friction,
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.080]   not impossible, but higher friction.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.280]   No one really is gonna use it,
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.260]   but it provides people a psychological piece,
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.620]   knowing if I did need to use it, I could, right?
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.220]   So people might be worried in your family
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.060]   or your circle of friends,
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.820]   if they're thinking, "Oh, you know, Oscar's not on this,
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.260]   but what if there's an emergency?
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:09.180]   What if we really need him?
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.980]   My goodness, like maybe this is better that you're on it."
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.460]   But if they have an escape valve,
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.420]   "Oh, this is how you get me if it's really urgent
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.660]   and I'm not on WhatsApp,"
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.160]   then that issue, that concern goes away.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:21.780]   You're not worried about that anymore.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:24.740]   It also, again, I don't mean to keep coming back to this.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.820]   I don't mean to be villainizing
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.760]   your family and friends, Oscar,
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.920]   but it diffuses potential defensive responses.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920]   'Cause there's a response that's like,
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.400]   "Hey, look, I need you.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.680]   I need you to be on WhatsApp because I'm swinging by."
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.120]   You know, your mother-in-law is like,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.200]   "I have to swing by to drop something off
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.800]   and I need to know if you're there."
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.200]   If they have the escape valve,
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.200]   it's like, "Yeah, but you know what you can do?
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.040]   You can call me."
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.120]   It's a bit more of a pain,
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.560]   but it's there and you can do that.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.880]   No one will actually use it.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.360]   Escape valves are all about the piece.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   Finally, consider personal communication office hours.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.000]   So I was reminded of this idea.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.280]   I mean, I first heard this idea
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.200]   from an entrepreneur I know named Chris Yeh.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.120]   And then I talked to Chris the other day.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.520]   So it reminded me of this concept
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.960]   that he had innovated years ago.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.540]   But Chris had office hours every day
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.680]   during roughly the same time when he was commuting
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.240]   from his office back to his house.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.080]   He's in San Francisco.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   Maybe he was on the 101 and there's traffic.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.520]   So he knew there's a 45 minute period
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.240]   where I'd always be in my car.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.760]   And so he had personal communication office hours
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.200]   for people who knew him, friends, family members.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.440]   You can always call me during that time.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.920]   And so it's a way that he could stay in touch with people
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.520]   and have serendipitous conversations
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.700]   and see what's going on
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.840]   without have to constantly be monitoring
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.160]   some other type of asynchronous communication medium.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.600]   So personal communication office hours
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.180]   are a great way of maintaining connection
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.000]   when people are used to being able to just outsource that
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.500]   to doing quick messages back and forth.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.520]   Now you're like, "Hey, call me, man.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.360]   Call me.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.240]   This is my time I'm available.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.340]   When are you gonna call me?"
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:02.280]   Or if they're texting you
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.660]   and you don't see it till three hours later,
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.800]   you're like, "Just call me at my next,
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.100]   call me, you know, you can always call me at these hours.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.800]   Call me next time you can, let's talk about it."
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.880]   So it's a way to have connection with people with, again,
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.520]   not having to monitor that screen all the time.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.040]   All right, Oscar, so that's what I'd recommend.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.720]   I think you're thinking about the right thing.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.980]   I do not think the constant monitoring
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.600]   of instant messenger type channels
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.640]   is compatible with a deep life by almost any definition.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.720]   It is an issue, but it's also really hard to get past.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.280]   Those are the three things I would keep in mind.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.340]   People will still complain,
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.440]   but they'll complain a lot less
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.840]   if you do those three things.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.120]   It is worth it.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.600]   You just can't live a focused life
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.240]   if every four minutes you have to check
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.160]   and jump in on an asynchronous back and forth conversation.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.080]   So reform your WhatsApp usage.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.680]   If they still complain, you can blame it on me.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.420]   All right, Josie, that's a good tight hour and 28 minutes.
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:55.220]   So we should probably wrap this up.
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:00.260]   Thank everyone who sent in their questions and calls.
