[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.560]   Today, my guest is Dr. Rhonda Patrick.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   Dr. Patrick is known to some of you as a podcaster
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.760]   and one of the premier educators in the landscape
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.840]   of mitochondria, metabolism, stress,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.480]   and other aspects of brain and body health.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.940]   Her podcast, Found My Fitness,
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.000]   is one of the premier podcasts in the world
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.560]   for disseminating knowledge about how the brain
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.520]   and body work and how we can use behavioral tools,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.880]   micronutrients, supplements, and other protocols
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.180]   in order to maximize our immediate and long-term health.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.480]   Dr. Patrick did her formal training in cell biology,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.760]   exploring the links between mitochondrial metabolism,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.600]   apoptosis, which is naturally occurring cell death,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.960]   which is a healthy form of cell death
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200]   that occurs in our brain and body throughout the lifespan,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.460]   and cancer biology.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.660]   She then went on to do postdoctoral training
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.960]   with Dr. Bruce Ames investigating the effects
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.480]   of micronutrients, meaning vitamins and minerals,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.520]   and how they affect metabolism, inflammation,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.060]   DNA damage, and the aging process.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.520]   She has published landmark review articles
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.160]   and primary research, meaning original research articles,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.880]   in some of the premier journals in the world,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.680]   including Science, Nature Cell Biology,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.060]   Trends in Cell Biology, and FASEB.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.240]   Indeed, Dr. Patrick is an expert
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   in an extraordinarily broad range of topics
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.840]   that impact our health.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.860]   For today's episode, we focus primarily
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.440]   on the major categories of micronutrients
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.640]   that are essential for brain and body health.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.560]   I have to confess that before the discussion
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.540]   with Dr. Patrick, I was aware of only one of the categories
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.380]   of micronutrients that we discuss.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.900]   And so you'll notice that I am wrapped with attention
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.580]   throughout the discussion.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.120]   And I think that you'll want to have a pen and paper handy
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.920]   because she offers not only a very clear understanding
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.440]   of the biological mechanisms
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.100]   by which other micronutrients operate,
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.280]   but some very clear and actionable tools
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.780]   and items that we can all embark on
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.640]   if we are to optimize our brain and body health.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.220]   We also discuss behavioral protocols.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.420]   Dr. Patrick is well-known for her understanding
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.640]   of the scientific literature on sauna
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.680]   and the use of heat and cold for optimizing things
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.840]   like metabolism, longevity, cardiovascular health.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.600]   And I'm delighted to say that we discussed that as well
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.920]   and how behavioral protocols can interface
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.880]   with supplement-based and nutritional protocols.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.840]   I'm confident that you'll learn a tremendous amount
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   of information from Dr. Patrick,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.340]   much of which is immediately actionable.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.080]   And if you're not already following and listening
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.040]   to her excellent podcast, you'll absolutely want to do that.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.940]   It's foundmyfitness.com is the website
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.660]   where you can get access to that podcast.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.860]   It's also on Apple and Spotify and YouTube
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.400]   as foundmyfitness.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.340]   Dr. Patrick also has a terrific newsletter
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.660]   that I recommend signing up for.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.060]   It's foundmyfitness.com/newsletter is where you'll find it.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.720]   And it includes research on fasting, micronutrients,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.940]   sleep, depression, fitness, longevity, and far more,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.540]   along of course with actionable protocols.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.040]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.700]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.880]   Our motivation for partnering with Momentous
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.760]   is to provide people one location where they can go
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   to access the highest quality supplements
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.540]   in the specific dosages that are best supported
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.240]   by the scientific research and that are discussed
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.880]   during various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.280]   If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.840]   you will see those formulations.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   I should mention that we are going to add more formulations
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.060]   in the months to come.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.580]   And you will see specific suggestions
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.480]   about how best to take those supplements,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.600]   meaning what dosages and times of day,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.400]   and in fact, how to combine those supplements
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.660]   with specific behavioral protocols
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.320]   that have been discussed on the podcast
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.560]   and are science supported in order to derive
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.600]   the maximum benefit from those supplements.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.640]   And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.240]   that Momentous ships not just within the United States,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.920]   but also internationally.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.640]   So once again, if you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.160]   you will find what we firmly believe
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.840]   and the best protocols for taking those supplements,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.660]   along with the ideal behavioral protocols
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.760]   to combine with those supplement formulations.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.600]   I'm pleased to announce
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.440]   that I'm hosting two live events this May.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.960]   The first live event will be hosted
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.240]   The second live event will be hosted
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.640]   in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   Both are part of a lecture series entitled
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.240]   The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.280]   during which I will discuss science and science-based tools
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.920]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.360]   And I should point out that while some of the material
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.040]   I'll cover will overlap with information covered here
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.680]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.520]   and on various social media posts,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.660]   most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.560]   from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.080]   So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   Portland on May 18th.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.520]   You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com/tour,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.820]   and I hope to see you there.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.360]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.300]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.520]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.920]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.720]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.960]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.480]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.920]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.800]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.240]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.960]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.400]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.660]   once or twice a day is that it helps me cover
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.400]   all of my basic nutritional needs.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.880]   It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.880]   In addition, it has probiotics,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.500]   which are vital for microbiome health.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.360]   I've done a couple of episodes now
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.280]   on the so-called gut microbiome
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.040]   and the ways in which the microbiome interacts
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.120]   with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.280]   and essentially with every biological system
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.040]   relevant to health throughout your brain and body.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.820]   With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.820]   the minerals I need,
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.600]   and the probiotics to support my microbiome.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.000]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.640]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.120]   and claim a special offer.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.900]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.620]   which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.740]   while you're on the road,
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.040]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.380]   There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.640]   is essential for various aspects of our brain
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.500]   and body health.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.600]   Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.980]   many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.420]   And K2 is also important because it regulates things
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.800]   like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.940]   and so on.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.740]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.240]   to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.740]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.420]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.720]   Thesis makes what are called nootropics,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.460]   which means smart drugs.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.780]   Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.420]   I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.340]   I don't believe that there's any one substance
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.440]   or collection of substances that can make us smarter.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.800]   I do believe, based on science, however,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.120]   that there are particular neural circuits and brain functions
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.200]   that allow us to be more focused, more alert,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.600]   access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.000]   That's just the way that the brain works.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.520]   Different neural circuits for different brain states.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.880]   And so the idea of a nootropic
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.680]   that's just going to make us smarter all around
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.920]   fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things, right?
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.000]   If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.200]   you're doing accounting, at different part of the day,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.040]   you need to be creative.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.240]   These are all different brain processes.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.760]   Thesis understands this.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.120]   And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.400]   to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.940]   They only use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.280]   which of course is essential.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.960]   Some of those I've talked about on the podcast,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.860]   things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.940]   They give you the ability to try several different blends
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.200]   over the course of a month,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.940]   discover which nootropics work best
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.240]   for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.160]   And with that personalization,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.060]   design a kit of nootropics that's ideal
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.520]   for the different brain and body states you want to access.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.840]   I've been using thesis for more than six months now,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.760]   and I can confidently say that the nootropics
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.440]   have been a total game changer.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.120]   My go-to formula is the clarity formula,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.260]   or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.300]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.240]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.220]   take a three minute quiz,
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.220]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.860]   to try in your first month.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.040]   That's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.680]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.800]   for 10% off your first order.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.420]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.040]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.600]   to help you better understand your body
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.500]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.280]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.600]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.680]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.200]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.820]   What's unique about Inside Tracker is that
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.080]   while there are a lot of different tests out there
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.760]   for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.720]   with Inside Tracker, you get the numbers back
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.900]   in terms of your levels,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   but they also give you very clear directives
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.620]   in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.240]   that can help you bring those values into the ranges
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.340]   that are best for you and your health goals.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.560]   And that's very different than a lot of the other programs
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   where you get a lot of information,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.720]   but you don't really know what to do with that information.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.380]   Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to understand
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.940]   and very actionable based on the very easy to use dashboard
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.980]   at Inside Tracker.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.440]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.000]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.400]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.700]   Rhonda, welcome.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.460]   This has been a long time coming,
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.520]   even longer than you know,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.220]   because even before we discussed you coming
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.600]   on this podcast as a guest,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.040]   I've been watching your content for a very long time.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.860]   So I want to start off by saying thank you.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.360]   You were the spearhead to break through
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.700]   from academic science to public education.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.560]   So I consider you first in,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.660]   and the rest of us are just in your wake.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.000]   So thank you for that.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.840]   That's been-
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.940]   - Oh, that is so kind.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.780]   Thank you.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.440]   - Well, it's absolutely true.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.480]   - I am so excited to be here having a conversation with you.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.860]   - Thank you.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.880]   It's absolutely true.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.860]   If anyone does their research,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.760]   they will realize that the statement I just made
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.600]   is absolutely true.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.680]   And there isn't even a close second, you know,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.200]   any other public facing educators
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.320]   that have formal science training
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   and do regular posting of content came in several years
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.880]   after you initiated it.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.060]   So we're all grateful.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.060]   I have so many questions,
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.080]   but I want to start off with a kind of a new,
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.340]   but old theme that you're very familiar with.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.400]   So temperature is a powerful stimulus,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.880]   as we know for biology.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.540]   And you've covered a lot of material related
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.200]   to the utility of cold,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.240]   but also the utility of heat.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.280]   And as I learn more and more from your content
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.980]   and from the various papers,
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.060]   it seems that there's a bit of a conundrum
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.520]   in that cold can stimulate a number of things
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.280]   like increases in metabolism, brown fat,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.120]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.900]   Hopefully you'll tell us more about those,
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.340]   but heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.640]   And I wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.060]   deliberate cold exposure and the discomfort of heat
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.200]   might be anchoring to the same pathway.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.080]   So would you mind sharing with us a little bit
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.940]   about what happens when we get into a cold environment
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.980]   on purpose and what happens when we get
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.960]   into a hot environment on purpose?
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.100]   And I'm hoping that this might eventually lead us
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.040]   to some point of convergent understanding.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.980]   So if you would.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.100]   - I would love to, let's take a step back.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.940]   And I think you brought up a really important point here.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.380]   And I think that point has to do
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.100]   with the intermittent challenging of yourself
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.580]   and whether that is through temperature changes
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.900]   like cold or heat or through other types of stressors
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.120]   like physical activity or perhaps even dietary compounds
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.900]   that are found in plants.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.000]   These are things like polyphenols or flavanols.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.920]   Humans, we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.600]   And before we had Instacart where you could basically
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.260]   just get your food delivered to you,
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.020]   before the industrial revolution occurred,
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:31.020]   we were out hunting, and I say we, not us, but humans,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.840]   we were out gathering, we were moving,
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.260]   and we had to be physically fit.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.980]   You couldn't catch your prey
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.140]   if you were a sedentary slob, right?
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.860]   We're moving and you had to pick your berries,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.700]   you had to move.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.380]   And so physical activity was a part of everyday life.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.100]   And caloric restriction or intermittent fasting
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.020]   was also a part of it.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.300]   This is another type of challenge.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.700]   We didn't always have a prey that we caught
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.120]   or maybe temperatures were such that
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.060]   there was nothing for us to gather, right?
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.740]   So food scarcity was something common
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.220]   as well as eating plants.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.940]   So getting these compounds that I mentioned.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.580]   So these are all types of stress, intermittent challenges
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.340]   that activate genetic pathways in our bodies.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.720]   These are often referred to in science
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.860]   as stress response pathways
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.340]   because they respond to a little bit of stress.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.060]   Physical activity is strenuous.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.400]   Fasting is a little bit stressful.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.540]   Heat, cold, these things are all types
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.620]   of little intermittent challenges.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.620]   And there is a lot of crosstalk between these stressors
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.680]   and the genetic pathways that they activate.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.100]   And these genetic pathways that are activated
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.620]   help you deal with stress.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.820]   And they do it in a way that is not only beneficial
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.960]   to help you deal with that little stressor,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.940]   exercise or heat, it stays active
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.740]   and it helps you deal with the stress of normal metabolism,
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.680]   normal immune function happening, just life, aging, right?
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.420]   So this concept is referred to as hormesis, right?
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.780]   This is a little bit of stressful challenge
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.820]   that activates these stress response pathways
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.120]   in a beneficial way that is a net positive
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.180]   that actually has a very profound antioxidant,
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.660]   anti-inflammatory response or whatever the response is.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.180]   It could be the production of more stem cells.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.580]   These are cells that help regenerate
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   different cells within tissues or something like autophagy,
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.500]   which is a process that can clear away
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.340]   all the gunk inside of our cells,
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.740]   pieces of DNA, protein aggregates.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.500]   So you'll find that these stress response pathways
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.980]   are activated by a variety of stressors.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.300]   So for example, one pathway is called heat shock proteins.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.860]   And as their name would apply, one would go,
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.780]   "Oh, they're activated by heat."
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.420]   Well, correct, they are activated very robustly by heat,
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.300]   and we can talk about that.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.100]   But you can eat a plant like broccoli sprouts,
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.980]   which is high in something called sulforaphane.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.860]   This is a compound that is sort of like a hormetic compound,
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.180]   or as David Sinclair likes to say,
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.020]   it's a xenohormetic compound.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.560]   I love that, I love that term.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.780]   And it activates heat shock proteins, among other things.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.900]   It also activates a very powerful detoxification pathway
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.300]   called NRF2, which helps you detoxify things
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.860]   like carcinogens that you're exposed to.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.700]   Well, guess what?
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.780]   Heat activates that.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.360]   So what I'm getting at is there is overlap.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.020]   Like cold also activates heat shock proteins.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.020]   You're like, "Really, cold?"
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.300]   Yes, it activates.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.700]   These are stress response pathways,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.620]   and they are activated by various types of stressors.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.340]   Now, you're gonna more robustly activate heat shock proteins
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.300]   from heat versus cold, but there is some overlap.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.940]   So I think that sort of forms a foundation there.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.380]   - Yeah, that's very helpful.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.740]   And it brings to mind in the context of the nervous system,
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.060]   I always tell people, you only have a small kit
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.780]   of neurochemicals to work with.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.780]   There isn't dopamine for Netflix,
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.220]   and then dopamine for relationship,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.600]   and dopamine for work, et cetera.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.300]   Dopamine is a generic pathway
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.800]   by which motivation, craving, and pursuit emerge, et cetera.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.980]   Just like adrenaline is a generic theme
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.140]   of many different behaviors.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.680]   And it seems that it is the job of biological systems
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.940]   to be able to take a diverse range of inputs,
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.740]   even unknown inputs.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.820]   Like we don't know what technology will look like
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.380]   in three years, but you can bet
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.080]   that some of those novel technologies will tap
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.980]   into the very systems that I'm talking about now.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.740]   And there certainly will be other stressors to come about
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.420]   that will tap into these pathways.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.180]   I have two questions related to what you just said
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.540]   before we talk a little bit more about cold and heat.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.500]   You mentioned plants as a route
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.180]   to creating intermittent challenge.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.200]   There's a lot of debate, mostly online,
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.640]   about whether or not plants are our friends
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.360]   or plants are trying to kill us.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.500]   The extreme version from the carnivore types,
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.760]   pure carnivore diet types,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.420]   is that plants are trying to kill us.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.040]   From the plant-based diet folks,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.860]   it seems like it's more about what's healthy
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.200]   for the plant and animals, and maybe for us.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.480]   But if we set aside that argument,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.560]   and we just raise the hypothesis
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.420]   that plants have compounds that are bad for us,
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.080]   but maybe by consuming them in small amounts,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.500]   they're creating this hormesis-type scenario.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.060]   So then I think we conceivably solve the problem.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.360]   We could say, yes, plants are bad for us,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.980]   but in small amounts, they provide this hormetic response,
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.240]   and they're good for us, right?
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.600]   So in the same way that too much heat is bad for us,
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.060]   too much cold is bad for us, can kill us, can kill neurons,
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.300]   but appropriately dosed in an intermittent challenge
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.960]   type of scenarios can be good for us.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.340]   Is that how I should think about plants and these compounds?
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.200]   Do you think of them as good for us or as bad for us?
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   They're a very sharp blade, and we want to use them potently.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.120]   - I actually, I think that it's almost impossible.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.080]   I mean, you'd have to eat nothing but the same plant
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.760]   all day, every day, in large.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.400]   I mean, the bioavailability of these compounds
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.480]   in the plants, they're attached to a food matrix.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.020]   You know, it's not like taking it
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.620]   in a supplement form as well.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.620]   It's such that it's very difficult to make it toxic.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.240]   Now, there are some cases, for example, if you eat cabbage,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.400]   and I think there's some group in Africa or somewhere
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.560]   that that's all they eat is cabbage,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.640]   and there is a goitrogen in cabbage.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.880]   It's not sulforaphane, it's another compound,
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   but that's all they eat every day.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.720]   Nothing but that.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.840]   - They get goiter, the thick neck.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.360]   - Yeah, and they're like iodine deficient on top of that.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   So I do think you can, of course, make,
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.440]   I mean, there are types of plants that are toxic
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.740]   in small quantities, right?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.840]   - Hemlock. - Hemlock, exactly.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.680]   - We'll kill you.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.760]   Folks, don't play this game with hemlock.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.200]   - But you're not gonna get poison from eating,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.480]   you're serving of broccoli at dinner, right?
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.140]   So I mean, it depends on the plant.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.660]   These generalizations are kind of, they're just not useful,
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.460]   and I think that a lot of people online,
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.300]   in the blogosphere, they gravitate towards them
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.840]   because it's just easier and it's a lot more sensational.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.320]   - Plants, meat, and starches,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.020]   I'm one of those rare omnivores out there now.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.680]   I feel like it's rare to be an omnivore,
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.320]   but I think once you step out of the social media,
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.280]   as you said, the blogosphere, most people,
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.920]   I would say 99% of people on the planet
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.440]   are probably omnivores.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.280]   - Right.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.180]   - And someone will probably correct me,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.200]   but I doubt the number falls below 98.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.080]   - I think if you look at data,
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.980]   when we have carnivore data, I can't wait to see it,
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.300]   but right now it's a lot of, okay,
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.980]   well this is a lot of anecdotal evidence,
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.500]   and there's a lot of good starts with anecdotes,
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.820]   but people change a thousand things at once,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.140]   and they don't realize that, but they do.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.180]   And so anecdotal data is only so good, right?
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.680]   It's a starting point.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.280]   And so we don't really know long-term
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.320]   what carnivore diets are gonna do.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.840]   They may be beneficial short-term.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.420]   They may be beneficial for reasons of elimination
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.060]   of other things, like who knows, right?
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.720]   Lots of possibilities, but I do think
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   with respect to plants, there's so much evidence,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.880]   like for example, sulforaphane is one that I really like
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.960]   because there's just evidence that sulforaphane
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.200]   is a very powerful activator of the Nrf2 pathway,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.960]   and this is a pathway that regulates a lot of genes,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.080]   and a lot of genes that are related
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.280]   to like glutathione production,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.200]   genes that are involved in detoxifying compounds
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.520]   that we're exposed to from our food,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.880]   like heterocyclic amines.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.540]   In fact, there have been GWAS studies,
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.960]   so these are genetically, these are studies
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.640]   that are genome-wide associated studies
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.120]   for people listening that aren't familiar.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.280]   People have a variety of versions of genes,
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.280]   and we have a gene that's able to make heterocyclic amines
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.920]   to basically detoxify it so it's not as harmful.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.520]   And people that don't have a certain version
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.760]   of that that's doing it well are very prone
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.640]   to like colon cancer and increased cancer risk.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.720]   But if they eat a lot of broccoli
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.840]   and cruciferous vegetables, it negates that risk
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.960]   because they're getting sulforaphane,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   which activates a lot of the glutathione transferase
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.920]   and synthase genes.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.180]   So glutathione's a major antioxidant in our brain,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.660]   in our vascular system, in our body, basically.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.660]   So there's evidence that eating things like compounds
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.720]   that are like sulforaphane or broccoli or broccoli sprouts,
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.280]   which have up to 100 times more sulforaphane than broccoli,
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.160]   are activating glutathione in the brain.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   There's human evidence of that.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.220]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.060]   - That is amazing.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.380]   - And plasma, yeah.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.220]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.840]   I just want to make sure when,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.760]   so broccoli sprouts are different than broccoli,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.940]   and you just told us that they have much,
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.600]   they're much richer in these compounds.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.160]   So note to self, I should have broccoli sprouts,
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.340]   not just broccoli.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.560]   Can we cook the broccoli and still get these nutrients
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.400]   or do we have to eat it raw?
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.420]   I confess eating raw broccoli is really aversive to me.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.580]   - So the sulforaphane is formed
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.660]   from a compound called glucoraphanin,
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.520]   which is in the broccoli.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.940]   And the enzyme that converted into sulforaphane
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.620]   is myrosinase and it's heat sensitive.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.920]   So you do somewhat lower the sulforaphane levels
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.820]   when you cook the broccoli.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.620]   However, there was a study a few years back
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.720]   that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.700]   ground mustard seed powder,
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.620]   which also contains the myrosinase enzyme,
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.500]   to your cooked broccoli,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.940]   increases the sulforaphane by fourfold.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:51.320]   - So this is great 'cause I confess I like broccoli
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.200]   if it's cooked to the appropriate density,
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.420]   not too mushy, but definitely not raw.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.920]   The idea of eating raw broccoli to me just sounds horrible,
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.140]   but I like the way mustard seed sounds.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.820]   So just a little bit of mustard seed powder
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.120]   added to the cooked broccoli
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.240]   can recover some of these compounds.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.600]   - Yes, so what I do is I will lightly steam my broccoli
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.120]   and then I add a little bit of my Kerrygold butter
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.440]   and then I add some mustard seed powder on the top of that.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.060]   And it's got a little kick,
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.840]   like it's just a little spice.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.860]   And if you don't taste that, it's expired,
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.620]   like it should have a little kick.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.980]   - And because I know people will want to know
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.440]   how often and how much,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.980]   are you eating this every day or most days of the week?
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.980]   - Well, I had shifted to supplementation with sulforaphane.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.940]   I've admitted, I'm admitting right now
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.460]   that I've been terrible about it the past,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.940]   like, I don't know, six months or so.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.780]   - The supplementation or the broccoli?
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.200]   - Yes, the supplementation.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.640]   And so there's another way to get,
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.960]   there's another compound,
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   and it's actually called moringa.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   And Dr. Jed Fahey, who's really the expert on sulforaphane,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.300]   he's a good friend of mine,
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.700]   he's been on the podcast a couple of times,
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.700]   he basically thinks and has done a lot of research
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.320]   on moringa as well, that it's like a cousin
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.800]   and it activates the NRF2 pathway similarly to sulforaphane.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.000]   And so I've been buying this Cooli Cooli moringa powder.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.240]   I don't have any affiliation with them.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.200]   - Cooli Cooli is a brand.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.280]   - Cooli Cooli is a brand.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.120]   - That you have no affiliation to.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.220]   - I have no affiliation, but Jed Fahey has researched it,
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.040]   like that specific brand.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.880]   And so it's like, it's legit, it's like science-backed
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.200]   in terms of actually containing moringa
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.040]   and activating NRF2, and I add it to my smoothies.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.120]   So that's what I've been doing.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.920]   - What are some dose ranges?
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.020]   And of course we give the usual recommendations
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.260]   that people should talk to their physician,
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.100]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.440]   But if people are going to, what do you take?
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.760]   That's always the, let's take the David Sinclairian approach
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.400]   where he'll talk about what he does
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.640]   as a way to deal with this.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.800]   And of course, everybody's different and should,
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.840]   in all seriousness, should, anytime you add or delete
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.260]   something from your consumption,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.720]   should consult some trusted healthcare professional,
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.200]   trusted by you.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.240]   What, do you recall the dosages?
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.780]   - I do a big heaping tablespoon.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.900]   - So moringa, coolly coolly moringa, it sounds like a song.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.100]   - It's with a K, I know.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.960]   But for people also listening, it's like,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.900]   well, why would I do that?
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.340]   I mentioned the glutathione in the brain.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.900]   I mentioned it in plasma.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.220]   It's been shown to lower DNA damage in people
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.460]   and white blood cells.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.580]   It's also been shown,
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.020]   there's been several different studies in China.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.600]   In China, there's a lot of air pollution.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.820]   And I mentioned that it's a very powerful activator NRF2,
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.260]   and I know you're familiar with NRF2,
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.160]   but NRF2 is like, it's your transcription factor
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.500]   that is, it is binding to a little specific sequence
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.760]   in a variety of different genes,
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.560]   and it's like turning them on,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.220]   or in some cases, turning them off.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.220]   It's regulating what's being activated
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.460]   or what's not being activated or being turned off.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.100]   And some of the genes are basically
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.160]   these detoxifying pathways.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.700]   We talked a little bit about the glutathione,
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.200]   but there's also ones that are involved
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.400]   in airborne carcinogens like benzene.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.240]   So benzene is found in air pollution.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.000]   I mean, cigarette smoke.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.820]   If you're smoking cigarettes still, please try to quit.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.660]   - Yeah, you're mutating your DNA.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.220]   Just say nothing of the lung cancer,
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.340]   you're mutating your DNA.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.220]   - And heart disease risk, heart disease risk.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.780]   But anyways, people, and this has been repeated
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.220]   in more than one study,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.980]   that literally after 24 hours of taking,
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.380]   I can't remember off the top of my head
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.660]   what the dose of sulforaphane from broccoli extract,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.480]   broccoli seed extract was, or broccoli sprouts extract,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.520]   not the seed, it was the sprouts.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.920]   Anyways, they started excreting
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.040]   like 60% benzene and acrolein.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.520]   I mean, that's something that we get in cooked food.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.440]   - It's coming out in their urine?
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   - Coming out in their urine, yeah.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.640]   - Well, I'm not a smoker, and I have to be honest,
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.480]   it's rare that I hear of a supplement for the first time,
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.760]   'cause I've been deep diving on supplements
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.480]   since I was in my teens.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.960]   This is fascinating.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.000]   And it brings me back to this question that we had before,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.300]   and I appreciate that you answered it very clearly.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.140]   Plants have compounds that are good for us.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.400]   They're not just stressing us.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.440]   They're activating pathways that are reparative.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.920]   That's what I'm taking away
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.220]   from everything you're telling me.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.840]   - Right, and that our bodies,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.600]   we're supposed to be getting that stress
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.280]   to have those pathways activated.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.040]   Like it is, you know, right?
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.520]   I mean, this is conserved among different animals.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   Like this is something that is, it's supposed to happen.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.640]   And in our modern day world, we don't have to eat plants.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.080]   We don't have to move anywhere or exercise.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.160]   We don't have to go through periods of not eating food
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.300]   because we can have it at our fingertips at any second,
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.140]   right?
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.640]   So I mean, we've got this conundrum
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.240]   of we're never activating these stress response pathways
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.320]   that we're supposed to activate.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.160]   We're supposed to.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.120]   - I find that fascinating.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.200]   Again, drawing a parallel to the nervous system.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.440]   So what I'm hearing you say is that historically,
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.160]   we would have to go through some stress,
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.640]   some confront cold or confront heat or confront effort
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.960]   or hunger and have to exercise essentially
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.880]   in order to obtain these compounds.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.760]   And then those compounds are reparative.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.280]   Yeah, I feel that resembles the dopamine pathway.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.120]   I always say, you know, there's nothing wrong with dopamine.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.840]   People think about dopamine hits as bad
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.680]   or dopamine is bad.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.720]   There's absolutely nothing wrong with dopamine.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.280]   The problem is dopamine, especially high levels of dopamine
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.520]   released without the need for effort
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.920]   to access that dopamine is problematic.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.220]   So a line of cocaine gives you a ton of dopamine
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.500]   with no effort except to ingest the drug.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.460]   Whereas working for four years or more to get your degree
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.200]   will release a lot of dopamine
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.240]   and a lot of cortisol along the way, as we know.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.900]   And it's considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.860]   A tremendous amount of, we're approaching the spring
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.160]   and there'll be a lot of graduations.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.020]   Weddings are coming up now that the pandemic
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.100]   is kind of hopefully slowing.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.500]   And there'll be a lot of dopamine.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.820]   High levels of dopamine are great,
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.980]   but only after the effort of having done something
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.940]   in order to access it.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.080]   And so that's what I'm taking away from what you're saying
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.340]   is that we need to go through this intermittent,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.160]   the different types of intermittent challenge.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.420]   And we are rewarded with particular compounds
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.380]   that are reparative, both for the challenge,
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.620]   but then make us stronger.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.220]   It is, hormesis really is, it seems,
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.660]   a case of what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.820]   So you mentioned-
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.380]   - Can I add to that one thing you just said?
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.220]   - Please, please.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.500]   - Because this has been shown with, for example,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.420]   sulforaphane in animal studies,
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.860]   you precondition, give the animal sulforaphane,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.460]   and then you expose them to like hypoxia
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.060]   or some sort of ischemic stroke condition,
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.600]   whatever they do to induce that.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.460]   And the sulforaphane, it basically protects them.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.020]   Like their precondition and their stress response pathways
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.500]   are primed, and so when they're then exposed
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.660]   to the ischemic stroke, their outcomes are so much better,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.460]   so much better than the animals
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.500]   that didn't get the sulforaphane 48 hours before,
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.340]   whatever it was.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.400]   You know, and this has been shown in multiple animal studies
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.820]   with sulforaphane specifically in the brain.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.500]   I know Dr. Mark Mattson, he's often thought of
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.820]   as the intermittent fasting king,
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.020]   but he's a neuroscientist, and he did publish some work
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.100]   and talks about sulforaphane as well.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.920]   - I'm really glad you brought that example up
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.060]   because many of the questions I get on social media
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.700]   and elsewhere are about traumatic brain injury,
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.500]   and TBI is just one example.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.980]   And people always think, oh, sports, it's football.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.820]   Whenever you say TBI, people always think football,
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.800]   and I just want to just take a moment to editorialize.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.220]   90% or more of traumatic brain injury
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.940]   is construction work, at-home accidents.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.180]   Football players, hockey players, martial artists
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.500]   are a tiny fraction of the people who have TBI
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.020]   and concussion of various kinds.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.220]   It just so happens that within those communities,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.020]   many of them, 75% or more, experience those.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.700]   So it's salient within those communities,
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.220]   but concussion is prominent.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.480]   People are always asking, what can I do
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.020]   in order to offset brain injury?
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.060]   I had a concussion two years ago, what can I do?
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.060]   And it's been a tough question
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.240]   because we really don't have anything for them.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.980]   I mean, you tell them sleep well, eat well, exercise,
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.140]   but it sounds like some of these reparative pathways
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.260]   either should be explored in the context of brain injury
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.000]   or I'm guessing are being explored
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.100]   in the context of brain injury.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.040]   - Yeah, so a couple of things there.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.800]   One is that, I mean, traumatic brain injury,
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.200]   I mean, it's terrible, but it's also, it's so interesting
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.620]   because it's also like literal real-time brain aging.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.960]   Like, you know, you're able to like accelerate it
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.300]   and understand, so I often think of,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.220]   when I think of traumatic brain injury,
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.020]   I think of so much overlap between Alzheimer's disease
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.020]   and dementia and these neurodegenerative diseases
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.820]   because there are a lot of similarities there, you know?
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.060]   And so sulforaphane, I personally think,
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.060]   and I do think there's been some animal research with TBI,
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.780]   I mean, and sulforaphane,
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.580]   mostly preconditioning rather than treatment.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.260]   So again, it's like, well, I mean, if you're gonna,
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.700]   if you want a healthy lifestyle thing
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.920]   and you're a construction worker
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.300]   or you're fill in the blank, that's, you know, gonna,
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.700]   I mean, anyone that drives into a car,
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.220]   I mean, you're at risk to some degree, right?
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.060]   - Or bicycle.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.900]   - Bicycle, yeah.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.400]   - Around Stanford, we have, you know, I would say,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.420]   people demonize motorcycles,
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.940]   people demonize a lot of things,
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.820]   but moving fast through space on a small object
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.340]   next to a 3,000 pound vehicle, I mean, we've lost,
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.600]   we have a number of friends that have died,
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.740]   we have a number of people with traumatic brain injury.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.200]   I'm not against cycling or cyclists,
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   but it's a risky sport by any stretch.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.740]   So in taking things like moringa
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.200]   or eating my broccoli sprouts,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.320]   maybe cooking them a little less
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   than I'm currently cooking them,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.940]   putting on the mustard seed, is there evidence that,
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.440]   well, first of all, NRF2 is expressed in neurons, right?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.040]   So those cells should be protected.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.400]   Are there other cells of the body
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.840]   that could possibly gain protection from these pathways?
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   - Well, lungs, for one, but, you know,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.920]   just even in plasma cells, I mean, I think it's pretty,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   NRF2 is pretty ubiquitously expressed.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.680]   Liver, so there's, I mean, there's so many animal studies
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.640]   that have looked at all those things.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   I try to kind of gravitate towards human ones
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.320]   'cause it's a little, a lot more relevant.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.000]   But I think, you know, overall, like I mentioned,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.680]   you know, DNA damage lower, I think it was like 24 or 34%
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   lower in human blood cells after broccoli sprout powder
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.660]   supplementation, and I made a video on this like years ago,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.880]   2016 maybe, and I think I have like the references on there
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.640]   to exact amounts, I can't remember.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.480]   - We can link to the video here.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.400]   - But it's kind of an old video, it's 2016.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.600]   But I also had Jed on the podcast,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.960]   and he did talk about this, but, you know,
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.080]   it's also been shown in randomized controlled trials
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.360]   to help treat autism and autistic symptoms.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.420]   And yet again, it's doing interesting things in the brain,
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.940]   and I think it does have something to do
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.180]   with the oxidative stress and the glutathione,
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.320]   which would be relevant for TBI treatment.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.820]   It hasn't been shown empirically that that helps
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.300]   with treatment, but I do think someone could do that study.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.860]   I think that it should be done, honestly,
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.260]   because it's a low-hanging fruit.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.220]   I mean, if there's any impact, and there is at least
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.500]   one preliminary study that glutathione is increased
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.480]   in the brain after humans are basically taking sulforaphane.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.160]   - Which is really, for people listening,
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.320]   that's so important because a number of compounds
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.060]   that people take in supplement form
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.920]   don't cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.620]   or they get metabolized in ways that what's listed
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.240]   on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.400]   for what your cells actually experience.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.440]   So that's very reassuring.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.560]   We will get back to heat and cold and this theme
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.120]   that I tried to service, but I just find this
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   too interesting to diverge at this point from these themes.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.040]   So what other compounds or micronutrients do you place
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.580]   in the top tier of useful, interesting,
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.660]   there are animal studies, maybe there are hopefully
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.140]   also some human studies.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.700]   We've talked about a few.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.180]   I know you've talked a lot about omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.740]   So if you had to do your kind of top three,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.760]   your superstars of nutrients for the brain and body,
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.060]   sounds like we've got one set.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.280]   What would you put alongside them?
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.480]   - Omega-3, the marine omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.480]   So these are found in marine types of animals,
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.800]   fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.000]   So there's three fatty acids.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.440]   There's one from a plant, and that's often referred to
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.600]   as ALA, people call it short, alpha-linolenic acid.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.800]   And then there's eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA,
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.360]   and docahexaenoic acid, which is DHA.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.200]   Yeah, but EPA-- - I'm amazed
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.320]   you can pronounce two of the most difficult words
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.920]   to pronounce right next to, and spell,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.620]   right next to ophthalmology, which if you can spell it.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.240]   I know people who have appointments
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.440]   in ophthalmology departments
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.640]   that don't know how to spell ophthalmology.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.560]   A little secret, there's an extra P in there.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.040]   So the ALA, I'm not going to attempt to pronounce it
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.560]   because your pronunciation was perfect,
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.600]   of both of these two compounds,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.160]   and you said are marine sources.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.600]   So fish, so sardines, cod, this sort of thing,
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.920]   but what about krill?
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.960]   I've seen krill oil, and there was a few years back,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.840]   people were saying krill is a better source
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.360]   for omega-3s than is fish oil.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.360]   I took some krill oil capsules, made me itch all over,
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.240]   so I stopped.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.280]   - Do you have a shellfish allergy?
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.520]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.100]   I don't think so, I'm not a big fan of shellfish,
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.200]   but I like, you know, I'll have oysters every now and again,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.780]   or shrimp or something, and feel fine, so.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.040]   - Yeah, we can talk about sources.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   So krill is a source mostly of a type of DHA
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.280]   and EPA that's in phospholipid form.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.240]   So it's a phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty acid,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.640]   and that's different than most of the,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.680]   well, if we're talking about fish oil supplements,
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.520]   that's a different story,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.840]   but if you're talking about comparing fish to eating krill,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.680]   like we're talking about the foods.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.520]   - Oh, I would never eat krill.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.840]   - Okay, are we talking about the supplements?
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.880]   Okay, so fish oil supplements.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.720]   - Yes, I apologize.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.400]   Yeah, krill supplement versus fish oil supplement,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.760]   and if you, if it fits the food,
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.600]   and if you, if it fits in the conversation,
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.920]   talking about great sources of omega-3s in their whole form,
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.400]   I have a bad feeling you're going to tell me sardines.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.440]   - Sardines are, yeah, they're awesome.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.520]   Anyways, except for the- - Except for the taste.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.260]   - And for the potential contaminants.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.880]   Mercury, I think, was one.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.820]   No, Joe was, yeah, it was mercury,
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.400]   and Joe was telling me about,
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.700]   like he used to eat sardines every day.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.540]   Joe Rogan was telling me
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.340]   that he used to eat sardines every day,
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.840]   and then he had like really high mercury levels,
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.020]   and I was really shocked,
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:09.020]   because sardines are like low in the fish groups,
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.560]   so the higher up you get, like swordfish and sharks,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.720]   like really high mercury,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.220]   'cause they're eating all the other fish, right?
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.440]   But I think some brands,
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.840]   and if you look at like Consumer Lab,
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.200]   Consumer Lab, it's like a third-party site
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.660]   that I'm affiliated with,
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.880]   but I use them because they do a lot of analysis
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.240]   of different foods and supplements,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.740]   and so you can look at like some of their sardines,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.600]   and they have a list of like ones that are pretty decent,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.800]   but anyways, back to your question
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.400]   about fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.160]   So one of the major differences
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.200]   is that fish oil supplements,
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.480]   if you get a high-quality one,
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.200]   it's in a triglyceride form,
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.440]   so you've got like a glycerol backbone
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.120]   with three fatty acids, and that's attached,
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.320]   and those are either DHA or the EPA.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.280]   Or if you have a lower-quality fish oil supplement,
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.840]   then you have what's called ethyl ester form,
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.560]   and typically the reason for that
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.800]   is it's when fish oil is purified,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.760]   it's run through this column with alcohol or something,
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.700]   they cleave it off the glycerol backbone,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.000]   and then it's just kind of easier to leave it like that
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.600]   than like re-esterifying it, which costs more money,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.600]   so you can get it in ethyl ester form,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   which isn't as bioavailable,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.200]   and in fact, if you don't take it with food,
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.280]   you're going to be in trouble.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.880]   You're not going to absorb much of it at all.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.400]   - Would you see this on the packaging?
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.920]   Is it going to say it's in this ethyl form?
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.140]   - Some fish oil brands will put it on their website,
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.380]   perhaps on their packaging,
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.000]   but most of the time,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.520]   you'll have to dig for it on the website and/or call them,
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.240]   but I think for the most part,
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.680]   ones that are like higher-end
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.920]   will market it like triglyceride form,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.440]   and it's not that ethyl ester is bad.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   It just means take it with food,
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.440]   so one of the major prescription omega-3s out there
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.040]   is both of them, actually.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.720]   Lavazza, which is a mixture of DHA and EPA,
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.360]   as well as Vasipa, which is a highly purified EPA.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.680]   These are both prescribed by physicians
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.200]   to patients with hypertriglyceridemia,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.960]   so high triglycerides, among other things,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.600]   I think maybe dysregulation of lipids as well.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.360]   - This is amazing for people.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.160]   So these are prescription drugs
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.500]   that are essentially very high potency purified omega-3s,
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.920]   but they're given to people for lipid issues,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.100]   so this is the treatment of issues with fat metabolism
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.640]   by giving people fat.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.200]   Just to really, I just want to push home,
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.500]   again, I'm not carnivore keto or anything, I'm an omnivore,
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   but to just push home that one thing that's so wonderful
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.880]   that you've done over the years that you continue to do
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   is to move away from these very broad sweeping statements
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.200]   about fat is bad.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.680]   I mean, here's a case where we're saying fat
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.160]   is not only good,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.880]   it can be used to combat issues with that metabolism.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.120]   And fats are not just one thing, they're many things.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.200]   So anyway, I just want to put a little highlighter
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.680]   and a point of appreciation there
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.560]   and make sure that people are sensitized to the fact
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.540]   that if you hear that fat is bad,
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.080]   you have to ask what kind of fat, right?
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.420]   And here we're talking about these omega-3s.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.680]   Okay, so the triglyceride form can be taken
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.440]   with or without food,
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.620]   and there's the prescription forms.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.460]   I don't know if I can get ahold of the prescription form
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.400]   unless-
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.680]   - You have high triglycerides.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.160]   - Or I have a friend with high triglycerides.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.400]   Nah, it's illegal, folks.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.280]   Don't share prescription drugs.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.600]   - Or you talk to your doctor and you say,
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   I'm already taking this from,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.520]   I mean, I don't know how it works.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.360]   Anyways.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.440]   - What's the dosage that you recommend people get
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.720]   one way or another?
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.680]   - All right, okay.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.040]   So the dosage that physicians prescribe
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.960]   for high triglycerides, for example, is four grams a day.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.360]   - Four grams of EPA?
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.120]   - Of, yes, of the vesipa.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.180]   I think Lavazza is also prescribed at four grams a day,
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.760]   and you can get either of those from your physician.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.320]   My father-in-law just got one of them prescribed
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.520]   because we were buying our own omega-3 for years and years.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.000]   It's like, hey, you can actually get this,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.480]   and health insurance can cover it,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.900]   and it's a really purified form,
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.160]   but you have to take it with food.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.980]   That was the bottom line.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.520]   I've totally gone on tangents,
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.880]   but you're asking more interesting questions anyway, so.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.540]   - Well, normally I ask about mechanism,
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.880]   and then I talk about protocols,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.840]   but in the-- - Or the why.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.680]   - Or the why.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.760]   - I mean, we haven't gotten there yet.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.960]   - But I think that, and we definitely will get there,
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.800]   but I think a number of people nowadays
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.680]   are just really excited
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.240]   about what they can do for their health,
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.600]   and so here we're just raising the importance of omega-3s,
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.720]   and then we'll definitely get to the why
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.000]   and the underlying mechanism.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.520]   - I think four grams is, I mean, and in fact,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.680]   Bill Harris, Dr. Bill Harris is,
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.260]   he's just one of the pioneers
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.880]   on omega-3 fatty acid research.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.280]   He was on our podcast not, you know, last August,
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.440]   and he was saying the reason FDA chose that
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.680]   was literally just because how much
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.480]   they could get people to take.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.600]   Like, it wasn't like an upper end,
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.860]   like, oh, this is not, anything above that is unsafe.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.360]   That wasn't the case.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   I mean, it was just purely like cost and like compliance,
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.080]   so like what they can get into a pill,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.900]   the amount they can get,
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.960]   and how many pills they can get people to take.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.360]   - I'm smiling because our good friend,
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.520]   Sachin Panda at the Salk Institute,
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.680]   who's done a lot of important work on intermittent fasting
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   and other incredible work on circadian rhythms, et cetera.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.000]   When I was talking to him in preparation
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.120]   for an episode on intermittent fasting,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.340]   I said, why the eight hour feeding window?
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.940]   And he said, well, the graduate student
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.200]   who ran those studies had a partner,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.840]   I think it was a girlfriend, as I recall,
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.200]   hope I didn't get that backward,
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.820]   and the partner said, listen,
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.700]   you can be in lab 10 hours a day,
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.420]   but you can't be in lab 14 hours a day
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.180]   if you want this relationship to work.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.900]   And so it was eight hours of feeding window,
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.500]   plus some measurements,
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.740]   time to walk into the lab, park the car, et cetera.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.060]   And so the eight hour feeding window
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.800]   that everyone holds so wholly
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.540]   was actually just born out of this relationship
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.960]   between these two graduate students.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.560]   Had they been single,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.380]   I was single all through graduate school
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.680]   or most of it anyway, and I lived in the lab.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.280]   So if it'd been me, we'd all be,
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.740]   intermittent fasting would mean eating 14 hours a day.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.360]   That was a joke, not a good one,
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.280]   but I just want to make clear I'm joking.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.160]   But the point that you're making is a really good one,
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   that the four gram amount is not a threshold
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.200]   based on anything except the threshold
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.380]   of people's willingness to actually take the stop.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.900]   So, and I think that's important for people to hear
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.200]   because so often we hear the eight hour feeding window,
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.480]   four grams of EPA, 150 minutes of cardio,
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.180]   and it's really a question of what you can reasonably do
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.440]   in a study.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.840]   - So I take four grams a day.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.880]   I take two in the morning, two grams in the morning,
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.260]   and I take two grams in the evening.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.940]   I take my EPA in the morning
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.820]   and I take my DHA in the evening.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.720]   - You split them.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.160]   - I do.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.640]   I don't know if, I don't think it's necessary,
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.960]   not necessarily.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.060]   I just happen to buy,
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.060]   I happen to get a certain fish oil supplement
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.480]   that's like separates them.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.720]   And so, you know, like Lavazza,
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   Lavazza is a great one and it's all like in one
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.560]   and it's easier.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.000]   - What if someone doesn't have a prescription?
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.680]   So I take over the counter fish oil.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.900]   I know I feel better
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.600]   'cause I've done the experiment of going on and off.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.960]   I take the mainly for,
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   I don't have depression,
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.080]   but my mood is better.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.600]   My joints feel better.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.400]   I just feel better.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.440]   And I like to think that my platelets are slipperier
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.720]   and they're cruising through any little obstructions
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.960]   in my veins or arteries.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.320]   That's the image I have in my head,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.440]   but I don't have any data to support that part.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.240]   - Yeah, I mean, so if you're asking for like,
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.280]   where do people get these fish oil supplements?
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.400]   - Well, let's say I look at the bottle
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.760]   and it says two grams per serving,
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   but then I look and it's 750 milligrams of EPA, right?
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.640]   Or a thousand milligrams of EPA.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.800]   Let's say half of it is EPA.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Then do I want to hit a threshold of EPA
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   or a threshold of what's listed on the bottle, right?
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.560]   On the front of the bottle.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.360]   And because my understanding is that
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.240]   we need to hit a threshold level of EPA
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.280]   in order to derive these important benefits.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.460]   - I think two grams is a good threshold.
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.460]   Now, the International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.240]   they have a website where they do third-party testing
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.840]   of a ton of different fish oil supplements
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.360]   from around the world.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.580]   And they measure the concentration
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.460]   of the omega-3 fatty acids in the actual supplement
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.800]   because nothing is ever what it says on the bottle.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.640]   And then they also measure contaminants,
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.960]   so mercury, PCBs, dioxins,
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.340]   things that you'd find potentially in fish
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.380]   that are harmful to humans.
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.000]   And they also measure mercury
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.600]   and then oxidized fatty acids.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.520]   So these omega-3 fatty acids
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.760]   are polyunsaturated fatty acids,
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.360]   which are extremely prone to oxidation.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.360]   So please keep your fish oil in the refrigerator
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.440]   because it's colder.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.760]   Yeah, they're extremely prone.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.360]   - Mine's in the cupboard, so now I know.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.520]   - The shelf life's increased, lower oxidation.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.360]   - It makes perfect sense.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.680]   - Right.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.400]   So anyways, they measure that.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.240]   And I typically like to look for,
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.000]   they give you a total oxidation number.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   It's called TOTOX, TOTOX is what we call it for short.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.720]   And I like it to be at the least under 10,
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.620]   ideally under six.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.880]   It's really hard to find all the right mixtures of things.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.160]   But people can go to this website
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.760]   and they can browse through the products.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.400]   I've put together an Excel sheet,
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.720]   which I have a YouTube little screencast
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.080]   that I'm yet to publish, press the Publish button on.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.600]   But basically you have to go back and check and update
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.960]   'cause these are from different lot numbers of the products.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.980]   They do have up to like 20, 27 or something.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.800]   And so I've gone through and found my top picks
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.640]   of high EPA brands and high DHA brands
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.440]   if I were to buy some, the ones that I would choose
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.800]   because of the low total oxidation
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.440]   and the high concentration of either EPA or DHA.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.280]   Now people can go and do this themselves.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.280]   It just takes some work.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.960]   - No, I'm glad that you did the work.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   I'm going to put up a tweet every week with you tagged
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.160]   until this list is published online.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.960]   Sorry, Rhonda, but I'm going to do it.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.360]   I know it's very sadistic of me,
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.120]   but in service to the community and myself.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.080]   - And I chose five brands from each and I tried to choose.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.440]   I tried to find one in like Europe and one in Canada.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.560]   So there was a great selection of US and other.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.220]   - I don't want to do that work and I trust you.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:35.000]   So yeah, I try and get two grams per day of EPA
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.160]   from supplementation.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.980]   I'll now put it in the refrigerator.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.820]   Mood is better.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.000]   I made that decision mainly based on the data
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.360]   that I'm aware of looking at comparison
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.980]   of people doing that anywhere from two to four grams
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.280]   of EPA per day, compared to SSRI serotonin,
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.080]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.680]   and treatment of depression.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.960]   And I don't want to take an SSRI if I don't have to.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.200]   And fortunately I don't have to,
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.160]   but the data by my read are remarkable.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.440]   People that take these things in sufficient doses,
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.860]   meaning the EPAs are able to get by with much lower dosages
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.500]   of SSRIs for depression relief,
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.360]   or in some cases to come off their SSRIs completely
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.080]   or avoid going on antidepressant medication.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.480]   Now, of course, this is not something people should cowboy.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   Mental health issues are serious, but what other reasons,
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.000]   I'd love your thoughts on that, on the mental health part.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.480]   And so maybe you could tell us what are some things
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.060]   that getting two to four grams of EPA per day
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.580]   is going to help with in our brain
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.980]   and the rest of our body.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.520]   - So do you know, so I actually published a paper
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.920]   back in 2015 about the role of omega-3 and vitamin D
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.100]   in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.600]   and impulsive behavior.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   But so like within that paper, like the doing background
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.240]   research, and this was a review article, by the way,
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.640]   I was just connecting dots 'cause I-
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.080]   - No, I'm going to grab that.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.540]   I confess I don't know the paper,
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.480]   but I love quality reviews
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.160]   because the references they're in are so useful.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.540]   - Well, there's a huge role for inflammation,
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.600]   the cause of inflammation and depression.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.080]   And I think we did a short animated video on this as well
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.260]   like years ago, back when I was publishing that work,
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:22.200]   where people are injected with lipopolysaccharide.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.840]   I mean, this is something that we're generating
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.480]   from our gut, mostly from our gut permeability,
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.080]   which happens a lot, endotoxin, it's also called,
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.080]   it's endotoxin lipopolysaccharide.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.820]   It's basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.540]   when bacteria die.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.000]   So like when the immune cells in our gut come into contact
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.200]   with the bacteria because we drank alcohol five days
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.520]   in a row or whatever, we release endotoxin
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.940]   or something stressed us out.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.000]   We release endotoxin into our body
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.480]   and that causes inflammation.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.800]   And so you can inject people with lipopolysaccharide
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   and cause depressive symptoms.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.680]   However, if you take those same cohort of people,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.840]   give them EPA, and I think it was somewhere around two grams
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.640]   and then inject them with lipopolysaccharide.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.040]   We're establishing causation here, right?
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.480]   It totally, the depressive symptoms versus the placebo.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   So the placebo was saline control.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.000]   So this was a placebo control
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.040]   because obviously it's hugely important for depression.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.160]   It ameliorated the depressive symptoms
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.840]   that was caused by lipopolysaccharide.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.880]   - Amazing, and LPS, lipopolysaccharide, is no joke.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.440]   Years ago when I was working on thermal regulation,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:33.160]   we would inject animals with LPS to induce fever.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   There's the vagus nerve registers,
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.560]   the presence of LPS signals
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   to these particular hypothalamic areas
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.800]   and cranks up body temperature
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.000]   because basically it's a signal
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.160]   that the body is infected, right?
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:51.000]   Amazing, so I will continue with my two grams per day.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.440]   Maybe I'll ramp it up to four.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   I'm not doing the DHA separately.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.360]   There's DHA in the same supplement.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.200]   Is that okay?
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.040]   - Yes, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.320]   And to kind of, well, we've got a lot of things
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.000]   to hit back on because one of your original questions
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.240]   was krill oil versus fish oil.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   And DHA specifically is in phospholipid form.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.720]   It's more bioavailable.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.680]   So our bodies, if you're comparing exact quantity
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.800]   or concentration in triglyceride form
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.080]   versus phospholipid form,
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.360]   you will get more in your plasma cells,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.240]   in your plasma plasma cell, in your plasma with krill oil.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:39.240]   However, krill oil supplements are so low dose.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.400]   Like, I mean, good luck getting two grams
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.560]   of omega-3 from krill oil.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.120]   And also krill oil supplements are notoriously rancid.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:49.960]   I don't know for whatever reason.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.080]   - Maybe that's what made me itchy all over.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.400]   - I think they're just, like, I haven't found
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.760]   a good krill oil supplement.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.440]   I pretty much stay away from it.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.120]   I mean, if you smell it too, I mean, it's just like,
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.680]   like, it just smells rancid.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.520]   So, but the thing is, and I also published a paper on this
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   back in 2019 or, yeah, something like that,
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:18.080]   about DHA in phospholipid form getting into the brain
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.200]   through a different mechanism than DHA in triglyceride form,
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.240]   and so it's going through a transporter
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.120]   called the MFSD2A transporter,
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   and I think it's very relevant
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.280]   for people with an ApoE4 allele.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.960]   So I kind of--
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.200]   - With an Alzheimer's susceptibility.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.080]   - Right, so like 25% of the population has an allele
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   and a gene called ApoE4, and basically it's ApoE,
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:46.840]   but the four is referred to as the bad kind of version of it.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.640]   This is something in our bodies.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.840]   It's also in our brain,
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.240]   and if people have one of these versions,
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.920]   if they got one from their mom or their dad,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.280]   they have a twofold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   if they get two, which is much,
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.640]   it's much more, it's less common.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.240]   I think it's like 2% of the population
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.360]   or something has two alleles,
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.920]   but they have like a 10 or 11 fold
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.840]   increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   So there is a role for phospholipid form,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.680]   DHA in the brain,
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.240]   but you also make phospholipid DHA inside your body,
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.840]   and you can do that by taking in more triglyceride forms,
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.040]   the two grams like the magic,
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.680]   two grams or more is the magic number, I think.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.720]   So kind of back to like the Y for fish oil,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.080]   and I personally think it is one of the most powerful
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:36.440]   anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle,
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:41.000]   things that we can get easily, relatively easily,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.440]   that is gonna powerfully modulate the way you think,
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.360]   the way you feel, and the way you age.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:52.680]   And a variety of different types of studies
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   kind of led me to that conclusion,
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.320]   a variety of observational studies.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.440]   So there's been lots of work by Dr. Bill Harris
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.920]   and his collaborators looking at what,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.880]   it's called the Omega-3 index.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.880]   So this is actually the Omega-3 level in red blood cells.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.960]   So red blood cells turn over about every 120 days.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.160]   So it's a long-term marker of Omega-3 status.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.160]   This is very different from 99.9% of any study you see
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.040]   or any lab that you go to
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.360]   to get your Omega-3 levels tested.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.960]   You're getting your plasma phospholipid levels tested,
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.480]   which is kind of like, you can think of it as,
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.120]   what did I eat a couple days before?
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.440]   Oh, I had fish.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.280]   My Omega-3 levels are great,
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.120]   but did you eat fish like that every week?
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.720]   Or was it like, you know, it was like you went out to dinner.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.720]   So it's not a great biomarker for long-term Omega-3 status.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.680]   It's kind of like the fasting blood glucose levels
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.680]   versus the HbA1c, which is like a long-term marker, right,
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.320]   of your blood glucose levels.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.800]   So the Omega-3 index, he's done a variety of studies,
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.840]   observational studies.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.980]   So for people listening, these are studies
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.460]   that are obviously flawed
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.680]   because they're not establishing causality.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.120]   They're, you know, you're looking at people's lifestyles.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.680]   But in the case of Bill Harris's work,
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.860]   he's measuring something.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.020]   So he's measuring the Omega-3 index.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.600]   And he's measuring the Omega-3 index in people
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.000]   and then looking at their mortality risk, for example,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.200]   or their cardiovascular disease risk.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.840]   And what he has found is that most,
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.200]   first of all, standard American diet
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.800]   has an Omega-3 index of 5%.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.920]   Japan, by contrast, has an Omega-3 index
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.720]   of around 10 to 11%.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.760]   Big difference there.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.120]   And they also have about a five-year
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.560]   increased life expectancy compared to people in the US.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.600]   - Do you think that's mainly due to their fish intake,
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:45.440]   seafood intake?
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.660]   - So what he showed was, I think it's a big part of it.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.660]   I mean, you can't always say it's the only thing.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:54.640]   But what he showed in his data was that in,
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.860]   and I think it was Framingham's study,
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.260]   where he looked at the Omega-3 index
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:03.480]   in people that had a Omega-3 index of 4% or lower,
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.060]   so close to what the standard American is,
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.980]   but a little bit lower.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:10.880]   They had a five-year decreased life expectancy
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.600]   compared to people that had an 8% Omega-3 index.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.080]   And so, big difference there, right?
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.000]   Five years life expectancy.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   But here's the really interesting thing, Andrew.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.120]   He also looked at smokers and their Omega-3 levels.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.240]   And so he stratified it, right?
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.720]   And he found smokers that had no Omega-3
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.800]   were like the worst of all.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.840]   I mean, it was just like the worst, right?
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.720]   We all know smoking is bad for us
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.240]   and will take years off our life expectancy.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.480]   But smokers that had the high level,
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.320]   like smokers that were taking their fish oil
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.480]   or eating fish or whatever it was
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.720]   they were doing to get them up to 8%,
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.520]   they had the same life expectancy as non-smokers
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.560]   with the low Omega-3 index, right?
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.400]   - Wow.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.840]   And that's amazing.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.760]   And it's also amazing to me
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.300]   that people still smoke cigarettes,
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.260]   but I see a lot of people vaping.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:05.340]   And I know a lot of people consume cannabis, right?
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.400]   Has there been any studies specifically of vaping
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   or people smoking marijuana and all cause mortality?
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   - I haven't seen those.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.240]   I haven't seen those.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.080]   - They're not motivated enough
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   to come in as research subjects.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.720]   That was, again, a poor joke.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.680]   It is hard to study people marijuana use,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.440]   unless I'm told by my colleagues that study this stuff,
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.960]   unless you offer people marijuana,
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.000]   in which case they'll do it.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.680]   But again, they're actually not very good research subjects
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.520]   in all seriousness,
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.320]   'cause they are not very motivated or consistent
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   and they forget their appointments.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.440]   So that's incredible.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.400]   And you mentioned that the data on pollution
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.520]   related to the plant compounds earlier.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.660]   So it's almost like these things are, again,
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.860]   are acting in a reparative way.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:54.040]   - The Omega-3s are, I mean,
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.180]   they are resolving inflammation.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.880]   They're like blunting inflammation.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.560]   They're doing so many different,
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.920]   like they affect so many different parts
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.000]   of the inflammatory pathway,
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.700]   which is, I think it plays a huge role
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.760]   in the way we age, the way our brain ages,
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.840]   the way we feel, our mood, just our joints, all that.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:17.000]   And so it's amazing, but it's not...
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.400]   - I love fish oil.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.720]   I feel better when I take it.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.800]   I try to eat some fatty fish a couple times a week.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.440]   I do want to just touch on food sources for a moment.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.680]   First of all, are there plants that are rich in Omega-3s?
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.500]   And second, I have some friends who are really into meat
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.480]   and I like meat a lot.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.840]   My dad's Argentine, but I don't eat very much of it.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.040]   I try and eat high quality meats
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.440]   in relatively limited amounts, but I do eat pretty often.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.800]   But I've been told by these sources
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.520]   of a questionable authority
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.440]   that if an animal grazes on really good grasses,
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:59.280]   for instance, that the meat can contain a lot of Omega-3s,
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.480]   which in principle makes sense based on this Omega-3 index,
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.400]   'cause you're telling me that a lot of this Omega-3
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.560]   is sequestered into the red blood cells.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.200]   So if I'm eating high quality grass-fed meat
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.800]   and the grasses had Omega-3s,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.960]   do my steaks have Omega-3s or no?
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.720]   - So there was a study published
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.680]   that compared conventional meat,
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   so meat that animals are fed corn or soy or whatever it is.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.840]   - Which is terrible for animals and people.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.700]   As far as I can tell, I'm sure I'll get some attacks,
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:32.540]   but that's okay.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.680]   I won't read those comments.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.120]   Again, a joke, I read all the comments,
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.960]   but it seems to me that these animals
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.680]   that have to either be taking fish oil
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.040]   or eat plants that are very rich in Omega-3s
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.340]   in order for the meat
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.960]   to actually contain sufficient Omega-3s.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.980]   - So the meat, comparing the conventional meat
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:57.980]   to the grass-fed or pasture-raised cows or cattle,
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:03.080]   there were higher levels of alpha-linoleic acid.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   And ALA, it can be converted into EPA and DHA,
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.200]   but the conversion is very inefficient
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.880]   and very dependent on a variety of factors,
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.640]   including genetics.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.800]   Genetics, a huge regulator.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.180]   Some people can do it much better.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.940]   Others, you're getting 5% of conversion to EPA.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:32.800]   Estrogen is a major regulator of making that more efficient
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.260]   and it makes sense because pregnancy,
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.480]   when your estrogen just goes through the roof,
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.880]   I mean, these Omega-3 fatty acids
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.000]   play a very important role in brain development.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   So women are supposed to be converting any ALA they can
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.400]   into the longer chain Omega-3 fatty acids, right?
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.400]   So estrogen does affect that.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.200]   But I would say plant sources,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.940]   so if you're looking for the ALA,
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.440]   plant sources would be walnuts, flax seeds,
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.120]   those are probably the highest.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.880]   But if a person is a vegan or a vegetarian,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.180]   their best bet is to actually get microalgae oil
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.120]   and you can supplement with microalgae oil
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.800]   because microalgae, they do make the DHA.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.700]   And so that would be a better source
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.960]   for people that are vegetarian and vegan
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.360]   rather than doing the flax seed oil
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.400]   because that conversion inefficiency,
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.280]   enzymes that convert ALA into EPA and DHA.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.920]   Again, it's inefficient.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.240]   - And then for people that eat fish, sardines, you said?
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.400]   - Salmon. - Salmon,
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.320]   and you have to eat the skin, as I understand.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.080]   - You don't have to, but it's good.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.520]   - It's rich with-- - The oil.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.360]   Yeah, and the reason I say,
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.160]   I think the best would be wild Alaskan salmon
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.120]   versus the farm-raised because the farm-raised,
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.280]   again, they're feeding them corn,
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.120]   they're feeding them like green and stuff,
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.720]   and then they give them astaxanthin.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.840]   So astaxanthin is a carotenoid.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.640]   It's the carotenoid that's in things like
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.160]   krill crustaceans that make their red pigment.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.960]   - Yeah, it's also being used now as a supplement
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.000]   and there's a prescription form
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.200]   to try and rescue some age-related vision loss
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.480]   because of the role of the vitamin A pathway
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.080]   in photoreceptors.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.540]   - Yeah, well, you know, actually the carotenoids themselves,
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.840]   so like luteinine, zeaxanthin,
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.720]   they're really good at sequestering singlet oxygen,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.000]   which is some damaging, right?
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.140]   - Yeah, as we age, because the retinal cells,
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.220]   cells of the eye are so metabolically active,
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.200]   they accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:43.120]   and mitochondrial repair and limiting reactive oxygen species
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.280]   is a major theme of trying to rescue vision, I think.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.120]   That's a whole other podcast and story.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.560]   There's some really interesting data now
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.200]   on the use of red light to try and trigger these pathways.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.260]   - I've seen some--
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.640]   - That's my good friend of many years
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.480]   and amazing scientist, Glenn Jeffries Lab
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.640]   at the University College London.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.480]   We should talk about that at some point, if not today.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.320]   - I saw that study like 2020, was it?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.200]   - Now they have a second study.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.040]   - Oh, do they?
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.560]   - Yeah, it's looking real.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.460]   I mean, you know, they're cautious.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.320]   They're appropriately British and cautious about it.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.800]   You know, I always joke
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.120]   if those studies have been done over here,
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.880]   everyone would already know about it.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.020]   Glenn is a very conservative guy,
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.080]   but they've done this stuff now in pigs and rodent models
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.780]   and now also two studies in humans.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   It's looking pretty interesting.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.700]   So sardines, but also anchovies.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.980]   I mean, by the way, I hate all the food items
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.800]   that I'm describing.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.440]   I can barely tolerate salmon.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.780]   I don't like fish at all.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.320]   Actually, I like live fish.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.700]   I had fish tanks when I was a kid.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.540]   I just don't.
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.600]   No, I find fish, unless it's in sushi form,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.880]   I find it absolutely repulsive.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.720]   And I don't know why.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.900]   I probably have some mutation.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.180]   - So raw fish is actually higher in mercury than cooked.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.020]   - Okay, well, that's good.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.500]   Now I don't really like sushi that much anyway.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.900]   You're giving me great reasons to not eat fish,
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.040]   but except I should eat these other fish sources
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.380]   or supplement more heavily.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.540]   That's the message I'm getting.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.780]   - I eat sardines, like every day,
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.600]   my like first meal almost is like a can of sardines
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.980]   and an avocado with like-
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.280]   - Avocado is good.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.420]   - Yeah, with a little bit of lemon
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.980]   and then some little hot sauce, like, you know.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.660]   - Does avocado have omega-3s?
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.900]   - Avocado is very good in monounsaturated fat.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.580]   It's not really high in polyunsaturated fat.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:22.140]   Omega-3 really, I mean, it's either the DHA and EPA
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.380]   that's in the marine sources fish,
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.300]   or it's the plant ALA source,
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   which is like the flaxseed or the walnuts.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.260]   - So it's rough.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.860]   I mean, all these companies now
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.420]   are making these plant-based products that taste like meat.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.300]   My wish is that they would just make a fish
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.340]   that tastes like a steak, but that's-
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.540]   - The fish come out albino, the ones that they farm raise,
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.580]   because they don't eat any of the-
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.420]   - I'm joking.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.380]   I don't want a genetically modified fish
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.280]   that tastes like a steak.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.720]   Although, you know, I love the taste of steak.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.240]   The point here is that if one doesn't see themselves
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.240]   regularly consuming these fish sources of omega-3s,
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.820]   it seems to me that the only way to really get them
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.440]   is from supplementation.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.200]   - And supplementation is a good way to get a high dose,
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.400]   and to get back to your dose point.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.400]   There was a couple of studies that basically, you know,
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.800]   I think there was some way they showed that people
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.820]   that are in the 4% omega-3 index range,
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.460]   in order to get to the 8%, right,
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.780]   the five-year increased life expectancy,
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.580]   if we're comparing the two groups,
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.220]   was to supplement with at least two grams.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.860]   It was about two grams a day.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.020]   And I think it was a little bit less
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:36.940]   if it was triglyceride form,
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.140]   but I think two grams is a good, safe number.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:43.740]   So most Americans that are not eating a lot of fish
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.020]   and they're not supplementing are probably
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.680]   around a 4% to 5% omega-3 index.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.220]   And to get to the 8%,
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.700]   and I think that's a good empirical way
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.760]   of thinking about it, right?
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.100]   Okay, well, I want to get to that 8%.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.640]   By the way, I'm almost 16% omega-3 index.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.900]   - Yeah, I was going to ask about testing.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:03.140]   So where can somebody measure,
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.940]   where and how can somebody measure their omega-3 index?
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.100]   Which again, just to remind people,
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.660]   is essentially the percentage of omega-3s
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.940]   that you have in your blood with the caveat
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.740]   that the omega-3 index will be heavily biased
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:18.700]   by what you ate in the previous days.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.940]   Not the omega-3 index.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:21.460]   Okay, so the omega-3- - Sorry, I misunderstood.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.780]   I thought you said in red blood cells.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.140]   If I ate salmon two days ago,
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.800]   my omega-3 index is going to go up.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.060]   - No, that was plasma.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:27.900]   - I misunderstood.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.140]   - So most people are measuring,
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.700]   like if you look at a lot of studies,
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.620]   and honestly, Andrew, I think a lot of the reason
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.180]   for conflicting data is because people
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.800]   are measuring plasma omega-3 levels, the phospholipids.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.880]   It's in a phospholipid, right?
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.260]   So your phospholipids are carrying things.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.540]   These are lipoproteins, they're carrying things
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.420]   like omega-3 and triglycerides and stuff
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.300]   and shuttling them around.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.680]   So the omega-3 index is actually in the red blood cells,
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.780]   and red blood cells take 120 days to turn over.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.660]   So if you're gonna do a baseline test,
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.620]   if you wanna know before supplementing what your level is,
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:06.060]   you have to wait 120 days before doing the second test
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.160]   after supplementing to know how much you went up,
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.540]   because that's how long it takes
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.340]   for your red blood cell to turn over.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:17.160]   So the omega-3 index, Bill Harris has a company
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.360]   that he co-founded, it's called Omega Quant,
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.400]   and they measure the omega-3 index.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.800]   They have a variety of different index tests.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.620]   You can do like a basic one or a little more advanced.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.620]   - This is from a blood draw.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.160]   - It is, it's a little blood spot thing, yeah.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.060]   And he uses money to funnel back into doing lipid research,
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.700]   so he's out there doing all sorts of interesting studies
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.060]   on omega-3s, it's great.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.260]   But the omega-3 index is great.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.380]   I think that, honestly, more people and more researchers
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:49.580]   should be using it because the conflicting data,
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.480]   it always comes down to what we're measuring,
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.140]   the sensitivity of it, are we even measuring anything?
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:59.980]   So you're giving someone 500 milligrams of DHA
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:00.980]   and you don't see any effect.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.840]   Well, did you measure what their levels were
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.820]   and did you measure the omega-3 index?
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.180]   There's all sorts of problems
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.420]   with randomized controlled trials,
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.220]   and I think that we need to, as scientists,
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.060]   we need to come together and like make some progress.
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.380]   I mean, you know, let's all talk to each other.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.060]   Let's figure things out.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.360]   Like this test is out there, it should be used.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.100]   It should be used not just by Bill's group,
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.260]   but like everyone.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:29.300]   - Yeah, well, and I'm learning so much from you,
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.020]   and I agree we need more collaboration.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.500]   I've always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.620]   in my lab at Stanford,
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.980]   and collaborating is just so much more fun.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.740]   Online, there seems to be a bias
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.780]   more towards creating silos as opposed to bridges,
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.900]   but I appreciate that you bring up the need
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:50.020]   for more collaboration, and knowing which measures are best,
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.380]   and in this case, now I'll thank you for the clarification.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.920]   I understand this omega-3 index is going to be best.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.000]   You mentioned you, so basically when now I look at you,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.100]   I think you are 16% omega-3.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.740]   - And dolphins are 19%.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:01.580]   I'm almost-
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:02.400]   - Is that your goal?
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.240]   You're trying to get there?
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.080]   - It is.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.900]   [laughing]
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.760]   - To do the interesting.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.860]   Actually, they should probably do something
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.940]   where you're trying to achieve the omega-3 ratio
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.060]   of your favorite species.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.060]   Now that we've covered a bit of how to get these things
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.060]   into one system, depending on what one eats, et cetera,
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.860]   and some of the better measurements,
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:27.540]   how is omega-3 and some of these other related lipids,
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.300]   how are they having these positive effects?
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.100]   In my mind, and this is incredibly elementary,
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.060]   but my understanding is that at some level,
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.060]   they're making platelets more slippery.
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.060]   Is that true or not?
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.460]   I hope, I'm happy to be wrong.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.020]   How is it possibly impacting my mood?
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.860]   Is it through the synthesis of membrane on neurons
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.520]   that allows neurons to release more transmitter,
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.180]   like serotonin and dopamine?
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.620]   I mean, what are some of the purported,
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.520]   reported, and known mechanisms?
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.620]   - I think some of the most well-known mechanisms
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:02.740]   do have to do with the omega-3 fatty acids
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:07.580]   being very powerful regulators of the inflammatory process
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.220]   in some way, shape, or form,
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.900]   whether that has to do with resolvins that are produced,
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.080]   so from the metabolites of like DHA, for example,
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.700]   resolvins play a role in resolving inflammation.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.400]   Like you want your inflammatory response to be activated
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.620]   when it's supposed to be,
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.240]   but you want to resolve that inflammation
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.020]   and the inflammatory response in a timely manner, right?
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.660]   And resolvins help do that.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.700]   And so resolvins are one.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.740]   And then there's these specialized
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.860]   pro-mediating molecules, the SPMs,
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.500]   that also help resolve the inflammation.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.260]   There's, like you mentioned, the leukotrienes
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.220]   and prostaglandins, and these things are being affected
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.020]   by EPA, and they do affect platelets
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.900]   and platelet aggregation, and they do affect
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.860]   that whole pathway as well.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.900]   And so there's just, and there's, you know,
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:57.220]   I think there's just so many different ways and inputs.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.020]   And so when we talk about inflammation,
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.640]   honestly, it's a big general term,
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.360]   but you're talking about, when you're talking
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.220]   about serotonin release, you know, at the level of neurons,
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.300]   you know, we know that these inflammatory molecules
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.480]   cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.380]   And I just mentioned ago about injecting people
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.080]   with lipopolysaccharide and causing depressive symptoms.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:20.380]   You know, it's known that omega-3, actually specifically,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.980]   EPA is able to help serotonin,
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.700]   inflammation inhibits the release of serotonin.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:31.420]   And so EPA is actually able to blunt inflammatory responses
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.540]   along with DHA as well.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.460]   DHA does that through solvents and stuff,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.520]   and this then helps more serotonin be released
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.180]   because you're not having so much inflammation
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.660]   getting into the brain and affecting serotonin release,
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.100]   right, that's one mechanism.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.860]   And then another would be, well, DHA itself has been shown,
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.660]   it's a very important fatty acid
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.660]   that makes up cell membranes, many cell membranes,
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.100]   including in our neurons.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.140]   And as you very well know, Andrew,
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.740]   the structure and function of receptors, of transporters,
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.700]   these membrane-bound proteins on the surface of our cells,
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.300]   including neurons, are affected by the membrane fluidity,
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.900]   you know, like how rigid and how fluid the cell membrane is.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.820]   And DHA plays a role in that.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.700]   And so, for example, in animal studies,
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.300]   if you make an animal deficient in DHA,
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.020]   their serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors,
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.620]   they're affected because the structure of them is affected
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.940]   through the fluidity of the membrane.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:29.300]   And so I think that's another mechanism,
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.260]   and I'm talking sort of general
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.620]   'cause I'm not a neuroscientist.
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.900]   - No, but it makes perfect sense.
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   I mean, we know, for instance, neuroplasticity almost always
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.420]   involves the recruitment of more receptors
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:45.260]   or an improvement in some feature of receptors
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.780]   to neurotransmitters, and they literally move laterally
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.260]   in the membrane, they kind of float around
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.080]   like little rafts.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.020]   Sometimes they are, in fact, in lipid rafts.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.260]   And so it makes perfect sense that these molecules like DHA,
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.900]   which are part of the structural fat of the neuron,
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.440]   because, of course, the outsides of neurons
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.620]   are basically fat, not just the myelin
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.100]   that people have heard of, but the actual membranes,
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.920]   that if getting that right,
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.660]   you wouldn't want it as rigid as concrete,
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.600]   but you wouldn't want it as soft as,
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.060]   need to come up with something here.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.940]   What's that gooey stuff that kids play with?
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:17.220]   It's like that goo.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.800]   Anyway, it's disgusting,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.000]   and it's too soft to be a membrane for a neuron.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.240]   That's what we know. - You get it in those machines.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.880]   - Someone put it in the comments
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.360]   and tell me what that disgusting gooey stuff is.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.640]   You don't want your neurons to be that gooey,
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.800]   and yet you don't want them to be like concrete either.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.220]   - It's a balance. - It's a balance.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.040]   And in mentioning DHA,
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.800]   I'm just going to realize I'm backtracking,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.640]   but I want to make sure
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.040]   that we close all the hatches for people.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.480]   We talked a lot about EPA,
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.640]   but are food sources of DHA
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:51.040]   that you find particularly attractive
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.760]   either by taste or by potency for DHA?
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.880]   What are just a few that we could throw out?
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.560]   Because I am aware that there are supplements
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.960]   where you can get a nice ratio of EPA to DHA,
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.680]   or you take them separately as you do.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.000]   But if I want to make sure that I'm getting enough DHA,
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.240]   what do I need to be sure I'm eating on a regular basis?
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.200]   - Well, the fish is packaging the DHA and EPA in the ratio.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   But I also do eat salmon roe, which is very salty,
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:21.340]   and it's a really high source of the phosphatidylcholine DHA
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.460]   that we talked about. - So this is fish eggs?
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.300]   - It is. - Yeah.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.140]   - Yeah, and actually-
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.580]   - That I like for some reason.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.660]   - Oh, do you? - Yeah, I'll eat.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.380]   So I'm discovering something about myself.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.220]   This was not meant to be nutritional psychotherapy,
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.900]   but you're doing that for me anyway.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.580]   I'm discovering that, yeah, I like eating embryonic fish.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.500]   I just don't like eating the actual fish.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.540]   - Okay, well-
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.700]   - Okay, so fish eggs are okay.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.540]   So caviar, basically. - Caviar, yes.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.020]   - And that's a good source of the phospholipid form.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.420]   And I was consuming that a lot
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.180]   because I wanted to get the phospholipid form.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.500]   So, and it's actually really good.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:53.780]   There's been some animal studies
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.860]   in piglets and rodents as well,
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.060]   showing that consuming phospholipid DHA
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.980]   during fetal brain development,
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:06.100]   like gets like 10 times more DHA in the brain.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.180]   Again, it's-
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.840]   - Makes sense based on fetal development.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.460]   So do I need to buy Beluga caviar?
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.300]   Stuff can get pretty expensive at $200 a tin.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.060]   - I don't think you need to, yeah.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.100]   I think it's a matter of preference.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.340]   And if you're supplementing
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:25.260]   with your two to four grams of fish oil,
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:28.420]   I mean, you're going to get phospholipid form anyway,
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.580]   'cause your body's going to make it.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.100]   - Okay, I've seen some containers
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.140]   of what I assume to be quality fish eggs
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.620]   that are not at the caviar level
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.660]   that you can find in the better grocery stores
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.380]   that aren't super expensive.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.540]   I wouldn't dip as low as to go eat, for instance,
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.380]   like fishing bait.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.820]   Like when we were kids, we used to go fishing.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.140]   You'd put the fish egg on the thing.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.340]   That's probably not good.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.140]   Although it's good enough for the fish apparently.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.580]   Okay, only half joking here, folks.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.540]   I'm just trying to protect you from yourselves.
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.140]   Don't get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bait.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.620]   Okay, so that's great to know.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.380]   So we have these plant-based compounds.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.860]   We have the omega-3s, so EPA, DHA.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:07.220]   And then you mentioned there's a third category.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.220]   What would you place in your third category
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:14.220]   of foods or supplement-based nutrients
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:17.820]   that our health, brain and/or body health
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.100]   can really benefit from?
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.580]   - I mean, I think the most obvious would be vitamin D,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.500]   which is actually, as you know,
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.060]   a steroid hormone that we produce when we're in the sun.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.740]   Depending on the time of year, we can make it in our skin.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.200]   And depending on how much melanin we have in our skin
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.500]   or whether or not we're wearing sunscreen
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.100]   or how old we are, it's a very,
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.060]   there's a sliding scale on how efficient that process is.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:43.460]   - And as I understand, there's an inverse relationship
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:48.220]   where the darker your skin is naturally,
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.300]   the more vitamin D you need to consume, is that right?
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.420]   - Well, the darker your skin is, the harder it is.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.780]   So there was a study out of the University of Chicago,
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.820]   this was several years ago,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.620]   where they looked at African-Americans
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:03.920]   and compared African-Americans to Caucasians
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.480]   with light skin, fair skin,
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.580]   and how well they could make vitamin D
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:11.700]   from sun exposure and how long they had to be in the sun
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.300]   to make X amount, right?
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.580]   And it turns out that African-Americans
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.100]   with darker pigmentation,
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.980]   which protects them from the burning rays of the sun,
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.420]   it's a natural sunscreen,
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.260]   had to stay in the sun like six times
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.900]   as long as someone with none of that natural sunscreen.
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:31.300]   So I think the take home there is,
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:33.180]   you know, a lot of people with darker skin
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.620]   living in Sub-Saharan Africa
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.120]   or people living in India with darker skin
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.500]   or in the Philippines, you know,
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.060]   these equatorial regions where there's,
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.600]   you tend to see darker skin because it's protection
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.440]   from the burning rays of the sun.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.420]   - And adaptation.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.520]   - They are in the sun war.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.360]   - Right, yeah.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.860]   - And they're getting more vitamin D,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.220]   but people that maybe moved to the United States,
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.280]   to like Minnesota or in a place where, you know,
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.700]   UVB radiation isn't, you know,
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.900]   getting to the atmosphere 12 months out of the year,
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.980]   it's only getting there four months, for example.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.460]   Or even living in our modern day society
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.940]   where people just don't go outside anymore.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.820]   I mean, we're inside, our laptops in school,
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.540]   we're at work, we're in our cubicle, whatever.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.420]   So supplementation does play a major role,
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.400]   not only for people with, you know,
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.480]   darker skin that aren't outside all the time,
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.320]   but for everyone.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.800]   70% of the US population has inadequate vitamin D levels.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.380]   70 of the whole US. - Amazing.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.860]   - So this is everyone.
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.380]   And so I think that insufficient levels defined
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:32.820]   as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter,
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.180]   and that's sort of defined by the Endriken Society,
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.500]   looking at a lot of different aggregate studies
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.960]   and all-cause mortality, for example.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.160]   There's been a lot of different meta-analyses
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.500]   of all-cause mortality studies where vitamin D levels
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.380]   really seem to be ideal
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.860]   between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.980]   And so in order to get to that level,
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.260]   if you are not outside all the time,
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.740]   live in Southern California where you're always outside,
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.920]   without sunscreen on.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.200]   I always wear sunscreen because I'm trying to protect
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.620]   my skin from so many wrinkles and stuff, right?
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.780]   But also skin cancer is, you know,
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.180]   somewhat of an issue as well.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:16.680]   So basically the point is that vitamin D
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.040]   is a steroid hormone, meaning it actually binds
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.440]   to a receptor, and another receptor dimerizes with it,
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.240]   vitamin, the retinoid receptor.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.900]   And that complex goes into the nucleus of a cell
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.020]   where your DNA is, and it recognizes
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.980]   little sequences of DNA called vitamin D response elements.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.440]   They're called VDREs.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.460]   They're specific sequences of DNA
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.900]   that this complex, bound with the vitamin D receptor,
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.100]   goes inside and recognizes and turns on a whole host
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.860]   of genes, turns off a whole host of genes.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:51.260]   I mean, this is important stuff.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.740]   Like imagine 70% of the population
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.380]   having insufficient testosterone, right?
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.940]   It's a steroid hormone.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.980]   - We might be headed there, but probably not.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.980]   - You know, I think that its names are very important.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.080]   And I think that one of the issues is that vitamin D
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.300]   is called vitamin D.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:13.760]   It's not called DHEA or, you know, variant, blah, blah, blah.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.300]   It doesn't sound like a hormone.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.060]   I also, I'm glad that you're mentioning skin
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.060]   as the major kind of interface between the environment
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.660]   and vitamin D synthesis, because a lot of people
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:26.860]   think of skin as just a protective sheath around us
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.780]   or something to adorn ourselves with earrings
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.140]   or tattoos or whatever.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.420]   But skin obviously serves those roles,
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.960]   but the skin is an endocrine organ.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.140]   It has the capacity to make things that impact hormones
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.660]   and to make hormones.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.020]   There's this beautiful study out this last year
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.180]   where this took place in over in Israel,
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:47.660]   where they had people get outside for 20 or 30 minutes a day
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:52.660]   three times a week, exposing a culturally acceptable yet,
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.940]   you know, substantial amount of their skin during that time
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:59.500]   and saw big increases in testosterone and estrogen.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.940]   And this is through a keratinocyte linked pathway
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.020]   involving P53.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.660]   They did a bunch of, this was done in humans,
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.300]   but they did some knockout studies in parallel.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.380]   And what this study told me or reminded me
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.900]   is that skin is an endocrine organ.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.420]   So the idea that sun could trigger the activation
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:16.540]   of a production of a hormone is really interesting
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:17.780]   and makes total sense.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.180]   So when vitamin D gets into cells
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.260]   and it's binding to these VDREs,
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:27.780]   what sorts of things are they triggering?
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.760]   So like for testosterone, we know it's going to trigger
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.300]   protein synthesis, muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.340]   With estrogen, it's going to be keep your neurons going,
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.700]   your joints feeling good.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:39.020]   I always remind people that, by the way,
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.340]   'cause guys are always seem to want to increase
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.060]   their testosterone and reduce their estrogen.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:45.780]   Just remind people, if you reduce your estrogen, guys,
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.820]   your libido will plummet to near zero.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.620]   Don't crush your estrogen.
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:50.980]   It'll also make you stupid.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:54.920]   If you're not already stupid, it will make you stupid.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.900]   So estrogen's vitally important for males and females.
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:01.460]   When vitamin D gets into cells,
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.920]   what sorts of things is it stimulating?
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.960]   - Okay, so first of all, it's regulating more than 5%
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.100]   of the protein-encoded human genome.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.640]   More than, and this was, I say more than
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.060]   because when I was looking at this data really in depth
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:20.060]   back in, starting in 2012 to 2014, it was that.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.760]   And then it's now grown.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.840]   But one of the important things
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.780]   that you'll find interesting
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.420]   that I published on back in 2014
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:32.420]   was that I'd gone through this big published database
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.720]   where someone had published all these genes
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.480]   they found VDREs in.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   And basically I found that tryptophan hydroxylase one
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.900]   and tryptophan hydroxylase two was on there.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.300]   And so then I started looking at the sequence
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.100]   and I was doing some in silico work.
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.980]   And it turns out that the VDREs
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.940]   in tryptophan hydroxylase two,
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:56.840]   so for people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:00.880]   is an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.080]   So tryptophan is an amino acid that we get from our food.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:09.520]   You convert tryptophan into serotonin in the gut,
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.280]   but you also do it in the brain.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.880]   However, serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.480]   So tryptophan has to get into your brain
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.000]   and then you have to convert it to serotonin in your brain.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.640]   Well, the enzyme that does that in your brain
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.720]   is called tryptophan hydroxylase two
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.720]   and it's activated by vitamin D.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.600]   The one in the gut is actually tryptophan hydroxylase one.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.440]   Some of my published work hypothesized
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.860]   that it might actually be repressed by vitamin D
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.720]   because it has a sequence.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.520]   The sequence itself, this 12 nucleotide sequence,
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.040]   it can determine to some degree
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.540]   whether it's gonna be activated or turned off.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.320]   And so I was able to kind of look at that
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.640]   and think, oh, maybe this and that.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   And so since then there have been some groups
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.360]   that have confirmed more with in vivo
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.640]   and/or in vitro studies,
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.120]   'cause mine was all in silico and all that stuff.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.860]   But anyways, so serotonin, a really important one.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.040]   But most people, I mean, this is regulating
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.560]   our immune cell, immune system.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.160]   It's regulating our blood pressure,
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   all that water retention.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.200]   I mean, bone, of course, homeostasis, 5%, more than 5%.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.400]   I mean, I can't tell you so much.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.600]   And with 70% of the US population deficient,
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.400]   I'm beginning to think that this could be the linchpin
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.960]   in a number of really important issues.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:34.960]   So supplementing vitamin D3 is what I normally hear is the,
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:39.520]   I do, I take, I think I end up taking 5,000 IUs,
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.340]   sometimes 10 IUs of vitamin D3 per day.
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.480]   Just done that for a long time
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.820]   and I've had my levels tested and they're in range.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:48.160]   But I have a family member, I'll just mention this.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.020]   I have a family member who was not feeling well,
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.000]   just kind of feeling off, a little low,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.400]   had some digestive issues.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.580]   This went on a long period of time.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:01.360]   Was taking, on my recommendation, 15,000 IUs of D3
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.760]   and was still deficient in D3.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.040]   Now takes, and I'm not suggesting anyone do this
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.840]   as a special case, perhaps,
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:11.200]   but no chronic illness that we're aware of,
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.800]   needs to take 30,000 IUs per day
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:18.080]   in order to bring their D3 range just into normal.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.440]   Which is, to me, is striking because they eat quite well,
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.240]   they're a healthy weight, et cetera.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.040]   But it, and it's made a tremendous difference
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:24.860]   in terms of their mood.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.920]   Now, of course, this is correlative.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.200]   Now they feel better, they're doing it.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.300]   Who knows, they're probably also getting outside more.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.940]   But I mean, I think people need to get tested.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.520]   They need to get their D3 levels tested.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.620]   But where and what is a good starting range
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:41.240]   for people to think about D3 supplementation?
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.440]   And again, foods that can increase D3.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.920]   - So vitamin D3 is a good way to supplement with it.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.960]   Their vitamin D2 would be a plant source.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.360]   You often find it as fortified in like foods like milk.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.200]   Usually D2, there's been a few-
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.360]   - Does anyone still drink milk besides kids?
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.240]   Oh, here it's like, you can't find cow's milk.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.880]   - I mean, all the lattes that you're getting.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.120]   - Oat milk, soy milk, what's the other one?
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.840]   - They're fortified in those as well.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.680]   - Oh, they are, okay.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.760]   - They are, yeah, they're fortified in-
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.600]   - I have a hard time finding cow's milk.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.880]   - Almond milk and oat milk and all that stuff.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.680]   Yeah, they're in all that stuff.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.040]   Vitamin D is naturally, to some degree in fatty fish,
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.360]   like you think about cod liver oil, right?
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.600]   It has vitamin D, but it's not,
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.560]   you're not gonna correct a deficiency with eating fish
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.400]   for your vitamin D.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.960]   Like you're either gonna correct it with sun exposure,
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.320]   being in the right area, having the right amount of sun,
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.120]   and being the right age, because as you get old,
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.600]   you become very inefficient at doing that,
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.720]   converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 in your skin.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.360]   So that's probably what was going on here,
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.080]   'cause this person is getting up in their area.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.400]   - There's a lot of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.160]   We talked about ApoE4 previously,
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.320]   but there's a variety of genes that people have,
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.520]   very common, actually.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.800]   In fact, I've had many people
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.160]   that have done that exact same thing.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.560]   So measuring your vitamin D levels
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.320]   before and after supplementation
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.440]   is the only way you're gonna figure that out, right?
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.280]   Very important.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.560]   If you don't measure it, you don't know.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.440]   You can't know what you don't measure.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.640]   So there's a variety of SNPs
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.160]   that basically make that conversion inefficient.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.320]   And in fact, there have been a lot
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.440]   of these Mendelian randomization studies.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.480]   So these are studies where people,
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.680]   scientists will look at common SNPs,
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.360]   people that have these common variations of a gene
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.900]   that's more than 1% of the population.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.280]   So it's not a random mutation.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.340]   It's actually found in a sizable percent of the population.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.460]   And then they've looked at various outcomes.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.400]   And a lot of times, they'll look at genes
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.940]   that are also involved in some kind of lifestyle factor,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.060]   so vitamin D and SNPs that basically make the conversion
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.540]   of either vitamin D precursor into D3
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:58.240]   or in D3 into 25-hydroxy vitamin D
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.860]   or into the active steroid hormone,
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.180]   which is 125-hydroxy vitamin D.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:05.620]   And there's a variety of different SNPs that show people.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.720]   So you're not looking at vitamin D levels at all.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.940]   You're looking at just the SNPs.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.300]   And you know if they have it,
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:11.540]   they have low vitamin D.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.800]   So it's really a way of doing a beautifully randomized
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.700]   controlled trial with an observational study
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:22.300]   because you're not biased.
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.500]   Vitamin D levels are also associated with health.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.560]   People that have higher vitamin D are either outside more,
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.720]   they're more physically active,
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.440]   or they're aware of their health
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.480]   and their supplementing, right?
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.580]   So you always have to worry about that
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.480]   when you're doing an observational study.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.780]   But Mendelian randomization is beautiful for that reason
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:41.420]   where you now just randomly, people randomly have these genes
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.740]   and it's not like, there's no health status.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.700]   Like if you have the SNP, like your friend,
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.900]   like your family member was healthy and all that,
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.340]   they were healthy and yet they couldn't get
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:50.740]   their D levels up, right?
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.700]   So these Mendelian randomization studies have found
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:58.020]   that people that can't convert into the precursor,
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.380]   the 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.460]   which is usually what's measured,
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.580]   it's the most stable form of vitamin D in the body,
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:06.320]   they have a higher all-cause mortality if they can't do it.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.580]   People that don't have it have a lower all-cause mortality.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:12.940]   They have a higher respiratory-related mortality.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.140]   They have a higher cancer-related mortality.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:19.220]   So to me, now why did I get on this rant?
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.100]   Oh, because you're a family member.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:23.460]   So basically, they also are more likely
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.500]   to get multiple sclerosis.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.340]   This has all been done with Mendelian randomization.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.580]   And so it really does hammer home the importance
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.700]   of measuring your vitamin D levels
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.840]   and being very proactive about that.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.820]   I mean, you can get it done anyway.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.660]   Your doctor will do it.
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:39.140]   You ask them to do it.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:41.700]   So supplementation-wise,
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.580]   typically, if you don't have one of those SNPs,
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:47.900]   for the most part, taking 1,000 IUs of vitamin D
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.460]   will raise blood levels
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:52.000]   by around five nanograms per milliliter.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.200]   So let's say you're deficient,
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.220]   you're 20 nanograms per milliliter,
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:57.060]   and you wanna get to 40.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.020]   You're gonna need at least 4,000 IUs
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:02.580]   if you normally don't have any of these SNPs
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.420]   that change your metabolism of vitamin D, right?
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:08.180]   Does it matter when you take it relative to sun exposure,
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:11.100]   time of day, with or without food?
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:15.840]   - I've seen some not so great preliminary evidence
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.860]   suggesting maybe time of day is important.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:20.020]   I don't think it really...
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:24.520]   Like, I can't seem to find anything that really suggests,
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.260]   because for it to actually be converted into the hormone,
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.560]   I mean, it's stored.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.400]   - It's a slow acting.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.020]   These steroid hormones are slow acting.
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.360]   - Yeah, it's not like a media thing, right?
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.980]   So maybe we'll get some new data that's like otherwise,
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.380]   but I just don't, yeah.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.060]   - It simplifies the problem anyway.
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:42.480]   So for people who are going to be stubborn
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.520]   and not get their D3 levels tested,
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.220]   or their D levels tested,
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:50.840]   and simply say, "Oh, I'll just take some D3."
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:55.060]   That was me, by the way, until I got tested.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.380]   I threw 5,000 IUs into the mix and figured,
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.260]   well, it's not gonna kill me.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.140]   It'll bring my vitamin D levels up.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:03.480]   I realize that's a bit of a coarse way to approach it,
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.720]   but I feel fine and I'm still breathing an ambulatory.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.540]   So is that reasonable?
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.580]   1,000 to 5,000 IUs for most people will be reasonably safe.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:13.840]   Again, we're not making...
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.480]   Just assuming that people are gonna just jump to it
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.840]   without the blood test.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.680]   - Of course.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:22.800]   I think that if we look at the literature,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.480]   the scientific literature,
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.840]   it is extremely hard to get like hypercalcemia,
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.660]   which would be the major concern with really high levels
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.380]   of vitamin D3 supplementation.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.580]   I mean, we're talking like hundreds of thousands of IU
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:38.040]   a day for a long time.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.080]   - Hundreds of thousands.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.720]   - Yes, yes.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.480]   Now, the upper tolerable intake was set
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.480]   by the Medicine Institute to be 4,000.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.960]   It was just like the safe...
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.480]   It was kind of like one of those things where it's safe.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.560]   I personally take 5,000 IUs a day as well,
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.960]   and my levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mil,
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.320]   and I do out...
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.560]   You know, I don't put sunscreen on like all the time.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.040]   Like I do put it on my face and I wear a hat,
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.840]   but like some of my skin is being exposed.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.920]   So I do make it from the sun as well, but...
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.640]   - I'm glad you brought up the fact
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.320]   that you keep arms exposed if you...
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:18.360]   Because in these studies that I mentioned before,
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.320]   looking at sun exposure on skin
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.520]   and increases in other hormones,
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.040]   testosterone, estrogen mainly,
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.880]   it became clear from looking at those data
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.040]   that the amount of skin that you expose is important,
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.720]   which makes perfect sense once you hear that.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.640]   But I think most people are thinking,
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.280]   oh, I'm out in the sun,
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.080]   but are you wearing shorts and a t-shirt
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.200]   or are you wearing a sweatshirt and it's a hoodie
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.500]   or are you all covered up out in the sun?
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.680]   Well, that might be great for setting your circadian rhythm
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.500]   by way of a light to through the eyes
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.400]   'cause that's the primary mechanism for that.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:51.120]   But seems to me that the more of your body surface
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.160]   that you can safely and appropriately,
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.380]   please folks, appropriately exposed to the sun,
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:59.700]   the more vitamin D you're going to create, right?
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:03.860]   So laying out on your back deck in shorts and a t-shirt
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.420]   with arms exposed and legs exposed
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:07.460]   is a very different stimulus
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.820]   than walking around in jeans and a sweatshirt, right?
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.660]   - Absolutely. - Okay.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:12.480]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.920]   Especially if you have sunscreen on your face.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.080]   I know it almost seems like trivially simple,
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:18.060]   but I'm not sure that people are used to thinking
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:22.820]   about their skin as a interface to create these hormones.
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:24.460]   So surface area matters.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.600]   - And by the way, there have been studies
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.500]   looking at people that are deficient in vitamin D.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.380]   In this case, it was African-Americans
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:36.540]   that were given a 4,000 IU a day vitamin D supplement
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.940]   to bring them back to sufficient levels.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:43.380]   And so this was a smaller study than I would like,
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:47.860]   but it reversed their epigenetic aging by like three years
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:51.180]   because again, it's a hormone.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.220]   It's regulating more than 5%
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.220]   of your protein-encoding human genome.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:56.580]   There's been studies looking
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.780]   at vitamin D receptor knockout mice,
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.700]   and I use this a lot in my presentations
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.420]   when I'm talking about vitamin D and longevity,
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.780]   but if you look at these animals,
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.700]   the vitamin D receptor, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.500]   vitamin D binds to the receptor,
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.560]   and then it complexes with the retinoid receptor,
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.100]   and they go into the nucleus of the complex
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.140]   and you turn on and turn off genes.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.460]   Well, if you get rid of that receptor,
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:20.320]   which is what you can do in animal studies,
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.580]   you can sort of determine what effects there will be
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.460]   with no vitamin D, right?
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:26.980]   How do you study no vitamin D?
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.940]   And so what was found was that these animals,
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.040]   and in fact, I don't think it was a complete knockout
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.060]   'cause I think it might be embryonic lethal, but-
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.680]   - Some hypomorphism. - Yes.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.360]   - Which is basically geek speak for a gene
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.180]   is vastly reduced in its number and function,
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:48.900]   people know what I mean, but isn't eliminated completely.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.360]   - Right, well, these animals,
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.440]   if you look at them after the age of four months,
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.020]   I mean, the mice look like, I mean,
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.960]   they're accelerated aging, they're wrinkled,
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.940]   they have no hair, I mean, they just,
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.540]   I mean, their lifespan's shorter.
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.540]   I mean, you can look at this animal
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.600]   and not know anything about mice or work with them
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.100]   and be like, that animal looks like it's,
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.780]   of course, mice' lifespans are only like two,
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.400]   two and a half years, but like 500 years old.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.480]   - Right, it looks like it went to graduate school twice.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.180]   - Actually, graduate school is a lot of fun.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:21.100]   I like to think I age backwards in graduate school,
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.500]   which is not true, I look at the photos,
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.180]   I definitely aged forward.
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:26.220]   You on the other hand look exactly the same way
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.640]   you did 10 years ago, I'm not saying that to flatter you,
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.180]   but it's absolutely true, I mean,
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:32.340]   the data are the data, it's remarkable.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.340]   So I think it's, I'm definitely gonna try
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.560]   and get my omega-3 percentage up there,
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.560]   I'm not gonna hinge at all on that,
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:40.900]   but clearly you're doing a lot of things right.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:44.740]   So if I'm taking vitamin D3,
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.680]   I still need to get out into the sun, correct?
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.880]   Okay, I think a lot of people don't know that,
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.200]   or at least I have family members
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:53.320]   that have been a little bit resistance,
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.400]   like I take my vitamin D,
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.440]   so I don't need to get outside as much.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.200]   I think people are really afraid of getting out
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.760]   into the sun because they're worried about melanomas.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:04.900]   And I'm as, to be honest, I'm as scared of sunscreen
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.360]   as I am of melanoma, like that some of the things
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.840]   in sunscreen are really spooky, mainly the compound,
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.560]   and here I'm not one of these, I drink tap water,
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.920]   listen folks, like people cringe, I drink tap water,
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.600]   I have the occasional croissant or donut,
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:22.480]   I'm 90%, 80% of the time I'm doing the right things
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.640]   the right way, I think, although I'm now gonna improve
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.700]   on them with this new knowledge.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:30.700]   But I don't like what I see in most sunscreens
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.800]   because if you look at these compounds,
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.040]   they cross the blood-brain barrier.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.240]   I don't want compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.080]   - Titanium dioxide?
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.920]   - Dioxide, some of the triclosans
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.640]   that are also in these cleansers.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.600]   I mean, once you know a little bit about neurons, folks,
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600]   you realize that the neurons you got are basically
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.700]   the ones you've got for your entire life.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.740]   You know, there's a reason why there's a blood-brain barrier,
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:55.000]   a blood ovary, and a blood testes barriers
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.120]   because the genetic material resides in the testes,
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.400]   the ovaries, and the brain, those neurons don't turn over.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.760]   There are a few new neurons, but not that many
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.440]   unless you're a mouse, frankly.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.220]   And so protecting those is very key.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.160]   And a lot of the things in sunscreen
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.040]   are downright dangerous.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.600]   So I think there are sunscreens that are safe,
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.800]   but it's very hard to figure out which sunscreens
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.840]   are free of these compounds.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.160]   I'm amazed that they're still on the market, frankly.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.700]   - I've always geared towards the ones with the minerals
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.440]   that are like reflecting it.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.560]   It is somewhat difficult to penetrate things
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.620]   all the way through the skin into the bloodstream.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.920]   I don't, but I don't know,
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:35.760]   maybe some of these compounds get in there easily.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.280]   I have seen the evidence with some of those things.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.000]   - Yeah, there is some evidence they go transdermal.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.960]   - And they get in, okay, well, I know that some of them
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.280]   react with the sun, and while they do protect
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:50.320]   from the UVA and/or B, they like form massive
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.160]   reactive oxygen species and carcinogen.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.600]   I mean, it's like the very thing you're trying
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.200]   to protect yourself from might actually cause,
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.240]   we don't know, I mean, like it's completely speculation.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:04.360]   But there is like, I think some more and more evidence
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.480]   coming out with some of those compounds.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.240]   And I can't remember all of them off the top of my head,
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.080]   but a lot of high-end ones also have,
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.880]   it's the chemical sunscreen ones, the chemical ones.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.360]   - We should do, I'm proposing that we do a journal club.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.520]   A journal club, folks, is where academics get together
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.940]   and read papers and they get together
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.680]   and they pick apart the papers.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.820]   There's a strong correlation between being
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:28.200]   an early graduate student and being the most critical,
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.640]   'cause once you've actually published some papers,
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.340]   you realize that most studies, people are doing their best
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.000]   within the context of what they can do.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.360]   But it'd be great to do a journal club at some point
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.180]   about sunscreens, 'cause I'd love to really figure out
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.360]   what's in these compounds.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.120]   I mean, people are using them like crazy.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.400]   And I'm not one of these people who's like,
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.160]   "Oh, I won't use commercial toothpaste
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.920]   or anything like that."
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.240]   Like I said, I drink tap water,
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.800]   I use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.700]   But when it comes to sunscreen, it freaks me out
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.760]   because some of these compounds do go transdermal
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.920]   and some of them cross the blood brain barrier.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.760]   And I'd like to keep my neurons free of that stuff.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.360]   Anyway, we're speculating now.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.180]   - Wear a hat.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.020]   - Wear a hat.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.120]   But get out in the sun and get your D3 levels up.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.640]   Okay, so we've talked about these plant-based compounds,
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.280]   the omega-3s and D3.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.640]   Unless there's something else that you just absolutely
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.220]   must throw into the mix,
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.080]   I probably will return us to the conversation
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.120]   that I opened up with, which is about cold and heat,
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.900]   which admittedly, I pulled us off that path.
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:28.360]   So I want to take full responsibility for that.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.780]   But before I do that,
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:31.120]   I just want to offer you the opportunity.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.120]   Is there anything that fit to supplement-based
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.620]   or food-based compounds that you think
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.640]   are especially useful for brain and/or body health?
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:46.460]   - I do think magnesium is important in there as well.
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:50.960]   I mean, I think, again, about 40% of the US population
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.500]   doesn't get enough magnesium.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:55.040]   It's an essential mineral we're supposed to be getting
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.480]   from our diet and it's-
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.720]   - Involved in everything.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.720]   - It is.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.320]   It's also involved in vitamin D metabolism.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.480]   And in fact, being deficient in magnesium
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.400]   may make it more difficult for you
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.760]   to actually make vitamin D hormone,
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.040]   so that 125-hydroxyvitamin D.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.560]   So one of those other factors, again,
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.540]   we talked about genetics,
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.680]   but there's also magnesium status as well.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.720]   Considering 40%, that's a big number.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.720]   Now, magnesium's also involved in making ATP,
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.400]   the energetic currency of our cells.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.880]   Basically, all of our cells need ATP to do anything.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:35.280]   And it's also involved in utilizing ATP,
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.920]   as well as DNA repair enzymes.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.080]   These are enzymes that are involved
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.020]   in repairing damage to our DNA.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:43.480]   I personally think that magnesium insufficiency
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.260]   causes an insidious type of damage daily
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:50.640]   that you can't look in the mirror and see.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.240]   When you're deficient in vitamin C,
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.640]   you're like, "My gums are falling apart, I have scurvy."
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.560]   But you can't see DNA damage.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.640]   You can't see it, but it's happening.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:00.880]   It's happening right now in my body,
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:01.720]   and it's happening in your body.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.720]   It's happening, normal metabolism is happening every day.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.120]   But we repair that damage.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.220]   We have repair enzymes in our body
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.840]   called DNA repair enzymes.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.240]   They require magnesium.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.240]   Magnesium is a cofactor for them.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.420]   What that means is a cofactor means
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.680]   enzymes need it to function properly.
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.720]   And so without that cofactor,
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.840]   they're not doing it properly.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.160]   And the way I like to think about magnesium,
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.240]   it's easy 'cause people go, "What food should I eat?"
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.780]   Naturally, that's the next question.
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:34.160]   Well, magnesium is at the center of a chlorophyll molecule.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.720]   Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.520]   So dark leafy greens are high in magnesium.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:46.640]   Basically, what does the 40% insufficiency in the US tell us?
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:47.820]   People aren't eating their greens.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.760]   They're not eating their greens.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.800]   They're eating their packaged food.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.720]   They're eating their processed food.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.480]   The standard American diet isn't really high
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.100]   in dark leafy greens.
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:57.840]   So dark leafy greens are how I like to get my magnesium.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.600]   I think it comes along with all these other important,
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.720]   I mean, you get calcium in them, you get vitamin K1,
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.240]   you're getting a lot of other micronutrients,
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.580]   and you're getting other compounds that we don't know about
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:10.420]   and ones that we know about like sulforaphane, right?
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:13.600]   - As with broccoli,
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:18.040]   do I need to eat the dark leafy greens raw?
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.920]   And in this case, I'm a little more open to it
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.680]   because I actually like the taste of, dare I say, kale.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.280]   And kale is a dark leafy green, right?
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.360]   It's obviously- - And it's high in
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.200]   lutein and zeaxanthin as well.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.440]   - No, I'm a trichromat, meaning I'm not colorblind,
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.000]   but I just want to make sure it falls
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.080]   under the strict category.
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.040]   'Cause every once in a while I'm like,
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.800]   "Oh, I eat my vegetables, I like avocados."
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.700]   And people remind me avocados is not a vegetable.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.560]   I love vegetables also.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.840]   But so kale, what are some other examples?
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.440]   - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard,
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.160]   rainbow chard, romaine lettuce.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.160]   - Is the bitterness an important component to this?
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.060]   - For magnesium, no, but for sulforaphane,
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.840]   sulforaphane for cruciferous vegetables,
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.720]   that would be the brassica family.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.060]   But your question about cooking them,
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:05.400]   so magnesium is, it is bound to the food matrix,
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:10.400]   and it can be somewhat less bioavailable.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:16.700]   But so cooking it can somewhat release the magnesium,
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.920]   but it goes into the water too.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.920]   So you have to either steam it or kind of get your water in.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.200]   - You can drink it.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.840]   - Yeah, I personally don't worry about it.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:29.680]   I just don't worry.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.400]   - Great, well if you don't worry, I'm not gonna worry.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.260]   - But I also like, I too supplement with magnesium.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:37.200]   I do take around, so supplementation with magnesium,
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.200]   I mean we could go on and on.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.680]   Let's keep this short and sweet
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.080]   because we're gonna get back to the other stuff.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.800]   But it can cause GI distress at high doses.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.800]   I personally like to take around 130 or 135 milligrams.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.640]   That way it's not like a huge bolus to my gut.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.880]   - But I think it depends on the form of magnesium too.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:56.840]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.360]   I mean, you can take like magnesium three and eight,
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.360]   for example, and it doesn't affect the gut as much.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.960]   - Magnesium citrate.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.000]   - Citrate is what I take.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000]   - Yeah, it's a pretty potent gut stimulus.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   I mean, I feel like it's a little bit harder to digest.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.960]   - Well, I take 135 milligrams should be pretty good.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.680]   And citrate actually, oh boy, do we wanna go here?
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.520]   - Sure, I mean, it's up to you and we don't have to.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.880]   I personally, I've been supplementing with magnesium
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:26.720]   for a long time.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.280]   - Yeah.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.280]   - I use three and eight and bisglycinate and malate
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.260]   for different reasons.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.680]   So yes, I would love to go there if you're willing.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.240]   - I would say malate would be the best.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.440]   And that has to do with the short chain fatty acids
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.200]   being good for the gut and a lot of work done
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.840]   by a former colleague of mine and good friend,
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.400]   Mark Shiganaga, showing that the short chain fatty acid
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.880]   citrate, malate, lactate, but specifically malate
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.820]   really in lactate are the other major ones
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:56.800]   that get into the gut epithelial cells
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.080]   and are an energy source for the mitochondria
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.500]   and the goblet cells.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:03.640]   So anyways, whole other topic.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.480]   - That's okay.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.700]   I take malate because I was told that it would be helpful.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:10.240]   First of all, it doesn't make me sleepy
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.220]   like some of the other forms of magnesium,
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:15.000]   which act as a mild sedative for me.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000]   They do tap into the GABAergic pathway,
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.640]   neurotransmitter folks that in general,
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.080]   broad sweeping generalization here,
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.240]   can have somewhat of a sedative quality,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.900]   which is why I take magnesium three and eight
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:31.360]   and/or bisglycinate before sleep,
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.640]   30 to 60 minutes before sleep.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.640]   Definitely enhances my transition time to sleep
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.420]   and the depth of sleep.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:40.100]   No question in my experience.
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.680]   There's some data that three and eight can be,
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.200]   can be neuroprotective, although those are still,
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.820]   those studies are still ongoing.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:48.380]   I'm getting the sense that maybe
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.480]   you're a little more skeptical of that than I am.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.760]   - Yeah, no, I've seen the studies with the three and eight.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.100]   I think like looking at the actual data
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:59.200]   from the one clinical study,
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.140]   there wasn't statistical significance
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:04.800]   until all three of the pieces of data were pulled together,
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.800]   but that really could just be
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.240]   because their sample size was too small.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.080]   - Right. - Right?
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.820]   - I'm thinking that that paired with the, there's some work.
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:13.220]   Yeah, the Guosong Liu's work on with,
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.340]   so in the, this is getting kind of
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:16.980]   into inside ball of neuroscience,
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:19.980]   you know that the quality of the labs matters, folks.
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.620]   And that's something that's not accessible
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:22.740]   to people outside of fields.
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:25.800]   And Guosong Liu and some of the other folks
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.440]   at that time at MIT, I think very highly of their work.
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.580]   And so the animal studies are indeed just animal studies,
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.700]   but I was pretty impressed
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:35.260]   by what they did in those studies.
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:37.420]   Very pioneering when you think about this
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:40.280]   being done 10, 12, 15 years ago,
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:42.840]   and then yes, we need more human clinical data.
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:45.260]   But I, for me, I figured that the,
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.380]   given the safety profile of MAG3N8,
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.620]   given that it helps me sleep better
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.820]   and sleeping better is just better for everything, frankly,
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:53.700]   that's why I take it.
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:57.020]   And bisglycinate and 3N8 seem to be somewhat interchangeable,
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:58.920]   but there's, I don't know of any reports
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.020]   that bisglycinate can be neuroprotective.
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:03.080]   But malate, I take during the daytime.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.020]   For me, and again, this is subjective,
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.620]   it has a tangible effect
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.420]   in improving the recovery time from exercise.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:13.340]   So I don't know that I've been sore from a workout
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:14.860]   since I started taking malate,
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:17.020]   and I used to get very sore
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:19.360]   from even kind of trivial workout.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:20.740]   So I don't know what's going on there,
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:22.380]   but I keep taking it.
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:24.920]   - Malate, again, the short chain fatty acid.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:27.300]   And I mean, when you do heavy,
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.900]   when you do intense exercise,
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:31.780]   you release endotoxin from your gut.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.500]   I'm just going back to the interesting work
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.940]   'cause the malate being the short chain fatty acid
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.860]   and, you know, Mark Shugunaga's showing,
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:40.980]   this is all in animal research, by the way.
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.940]   But I mean, it was like feeding these animals malate.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.540]   I mean, it really protected the gut, endotoxin release,
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.460]   and it affected metabolic syndrome and all sorts of things.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:50.940]   But I think malate's awesome,
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:52.660]   and I always try to eat green apples.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:53.980]   They're really high in malic acid.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:56.340]   - Oh, good to know. - And tart cherries.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:57.900]   Tart cherries are really high in it as well.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.940]   - They also taste really good.
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:00.420]   - But I was really interested
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.760]   in the magnesium 3N8 stuff.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.780]   I take a supplement called Magnesium by Moon Juice,
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.820]   and it's like a little powder.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:09.980]   It's got a little bit of monk fruit, but it tastes good.
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:13.260]   So I do it a little bit before bedtime as well,
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.900]   probably several more hours though,
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.860]   because I don't like to drink tons and tons of fluids
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:17.700]   before I go to bed.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.540]   And it has magnesium 3N8
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:23.020]   and a variety of other versions of magnesium in it as well,
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:24.060]   and I really like it.
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.940]   But I thought the magnesium 3N8 stuff
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.540]   was super interesting.
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.500]   I would love to see more clinical data as well,
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.140]   but I think, you know, once we get it,
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.460]   it'll probably be like, oh yeah,
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:33.780]   it's getting into the brain and it's awesome.
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.700]   So, you know, why wait? (laughs)
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.420]   - Right, and along those lines,
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:40.340]   I once put out a post that said, you know,
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:42.380]   I feel like there are a number of different categories
[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:45.620]   of health information consumers online
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.420]   and understanding which one you're in
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.940]   for which topic can alleviate a lot of the strain and stress
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:50.940]   of finding the information.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.020]   There's some people that are perfectly comfortable
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.180]   with data from a mouse study.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:56.460]   It's like, if it's done in mice, great, I'll try it.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:59.260]   Other people say, no, it has to be done in humans,
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.380]   double-blind placebo-controlled studies,
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:04.100]   randomized clinical trials, et cetera.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.700]   Then other people are just say, you know what,
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:06.900]   I don't even care about any of that,
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.580]   just tell me what you do.
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:09.660]   And then other people are saying, you know what,
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.100]   I don't even care what you do, just tell me what to do.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.780]   And then there's this other category,
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:15.740]   which are, if it's in pill form or powder form,
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:16.660]   they'll take it.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.460]   And so I think a lot of the battles
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.020]   of people picking apart people's posts and things
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:23.580]   have to do with the fact that people don't realize
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.740]   that people are showing up to the table
[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:29.980]   in one or some combination of those stances.
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:31.460]   We know people that will try anything
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.300]   and we know people that won't take anything.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:38.300]   So the idea here is to create an array of possibilities
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:40.220]   for people, and I think the animal data
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.940]   are very impressive.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:43.020]   We should have you back on to talk.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:44.420]   - I take it with the hope of,
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.060]   because I feel like the animal data is very promising.
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.060]   And so I'm like, it probably is, so why not?
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:52.460]   - Well, and obviously you're doing things right.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:58.500]   So cold and heat converge on some common pathways
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:02.300]   related to what you called intermittent challenge,
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.140]   which I love.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:08.140]   I think if intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise,
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.100]   I mean, maybe even intermittent sleep deprivation,
[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:11.900]   I keep waiting for the intermittent sleep deprivation
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:15.180]   movement, I will say I pull a few all-nighters per year
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:18.580]   just for work demands and procrastination and deadlines.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:22.180]   And I'm the worst combination of academic
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:24.740]   'cause I'm both a procrastinator and a perfectionist.
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:26.940]   So you end up pulling some all-nighters.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:29.820]   The sleep I get the next night is pretty amazing.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:31.820]   I must say, it's the sleep of gods,
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:34.060]   but I don't recommend anyone use sleep deprivation for that.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:36.020]   But I could imagine that we also evolved
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.980]   having some sleepless nights.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.180]   So this idea of intermittent challenges
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:41.100]   is a really attractive one.
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:42.420]   And I want to make sure that we credit you
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:43.900]   with the phrase intermittent challenge.
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.780]   - No, credit Dr. Mark Mattson.
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:47.100]   - Okay, Dr. Mark Mattson gets-
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.940]   - Who has published and he has used that-
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:50.620]   - Used that phrase, okay, great.
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:51.460]   We'll make sure.
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.180]   - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, I love the xenohormesis.
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:56.660]   He was in one of his publications just so many years ago.
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:57.500]   I just love it.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:59.020]   It's brilliant, a brilliant term.
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.300]   So Mark Mattson-
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:02.420]   - Those Harvard guys are pretty smart.
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:05.700]   You know, I mean, it's a good school, I guess.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.780]   Of course, it's a good school.
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.460]   We will credit the appropriate people.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.380]   Thank you for that clarification.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:16.380]   So you've talked a lot about the use of deliberate,
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:17.900]   what I call deliberate cold exposure,
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:19.820]   only to distinguish it from cold
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:21.580]   that you might just be accidentally exposed to.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.780]   But it's sort of obvious when we say cold exposure.
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:27.420]   There are some amazing data on cold.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.140]   The other day I saw a post from you
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.740]   and you've included this in talks before.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.820]   I did not know this until I learned it from you.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:33.940]   So credit to you.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:38.340]   That even 20 seconds of immersion in,
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:39.740]   I think it was four degree-
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:41.020]   - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.720]   - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:43.560]   Okay, I was translating this.
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.260]   I'll say about 49 degree Fahrenheit water.
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:48.340]   So cold water can lead to long lasting increases
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:49.700]   in epinephrine, adrenaline.
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:54.500]   And I have to presume other neuromodulators
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:55.820]   and neurochemicals as well.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:00.260]   What are some cold protocols that you find
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:02.460]   particularly interesting or attractive
[01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:05.020]   from the standpoint of, I don't know,
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:10.020]   pick your favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects,
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:12.840]   brown fat stimulation,
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.100]   which of course weaves back to metabolism.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.860]   You know, we could do an entire episode all about cold,
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:21.740]   but what I'd love to know is what sort of activity
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:24.540]   or stimulus do you think is a reasonable
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:28.920]   and particularly potent one to use in terms of cold?
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.580]   - So today I did three minutes at 49 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:33.780]   I have a cold tub.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:35.300]   - So you get in up to your neck?
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.900]   - Well, I try, I keep floating up.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.180]   And so I'm like, it's like really hard.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:45.180]   So like, I would say like maybe most of my shoulder,
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.740]   I mean, really I'm floating up.
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.980]   I was telling my husband, I was like,
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.240]   there's too much water in here for me.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.380]   I can't- - Or too much salt in there?
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.660]   Or is it like the Dead Sea where you float on top?
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:54.540]   - Is there salt in there?
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:56.820]   I don't know, he takes care of all the stuff that,
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:59.700]   you know, it's the plunge.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.260]   - Yeah, and by the way,
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.060]   the podcast "Nor I Am" sponsored by Plunge,
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:03.940]   they did give me one.
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.080]   That thing is fantastic.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.500]   Also 'cause it circulates the water.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:07.320]   - It does. - Which makes sure
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.580]   that you break up the thermal layer and it's even colder.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.460]   - It is even colder, it sucks.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:16.460]   Anyways, so look, I'll give it, I'll be honest here.
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:19.020]   I wish I did more cold than I do.
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.580]   I do cold when I'm gonna go on a podcast.
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:24.100]   I definitely do cold when I'm gonna do a podcast,
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:26.820]   when I'm gonna give a talk or when I'm anxious.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:28.960]   I need to make it more of a ritual.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.940]   I love doing the sauna.
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:33.260]   I hate the cold, I hate it, unless it's summertime.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:34.100]   It's a lot easier for me
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.420]   to get in the cold in the summertime.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:40.420]   But what I do love about the cold is how I feel after.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:45.700]   And I feel less anxious, I feel good, I feel more focused,
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.020]   which is why I usually do it before any type
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:54.640]   of public speaking or when I'm just anxious.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:55.480]   I'll just get in there.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.100]   And so the 20 seconds at 49 degrees,
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.080]   I think it was 49 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:06.080]   was really a good number because time and temperature do,
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:09.140]   time or duration, I guess would be a better word,
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.180]   and temperature do matter.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:16.180]   But you can do 20 seconds at a colder temperature,
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:20.200]   which is I prefer, or you can do a minute or longer
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.040]   at a warmer temperature.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.040]   I think there was another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.880]   at one hour, it was like two, three, four,
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.340]   but who wants to do one hour at 59?
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.400]   - Yeah, I'm familiar with that study.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.580]   I love, so this is really reveals
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:34.940]   just how absolutely nerdy I am
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:37.600]   and maybe why some times and relationships in my life
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:38.440]   were challenged.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.120]   I love reading the method sections of papers.
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.240]   So people can come at me with a number of things
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:45.580]   about papers and I might miss something.
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:47.840]   Surely I miss certain things like anybody does,
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.320]   but the methods I sort of, I relish in reading the methods.
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:52.640]   And that paper is really interesting
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:55.640]   'cause they had people sit in lawn chairs basically
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.480]   in swimming pools for an hour.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.240]   And it wasn't really, it was chilly.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:01.520]   It wasn't super cold.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.840]   I mean, 60 is not, it's not warm,
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:06.040]   but it's not ice cold, obviously.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.040]   But an hour is ridiculous at some level,
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:13.960]   but the increases in dopamine were massive and lasted hours.
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:16.660]   So it's really, so the mood enhancing effects
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:19.360]   that you report are, they're not,
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:20.600]   you're not imagining that.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.260]   Those are almost certainly the consequence
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.100]   of having slowly elevating,
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:29.600]   but significantly elevated dopamine that goes on for hours.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.760]   That's almost a dream-like profile for dopamine
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.560]   because most everything else, like an Adderall,
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:38.460]   a Ritalin, a cup of coffee and a workout drink
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:39.760]   or pre-workout drink or something
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.940]   is gonna give you a big spike in adrenaline and dopamine
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.660]   and a big crash.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:47.900]   And somehow it creates this really nice contoured profile.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.860]   So I, whatever you're experiencing there
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:52.440]   is very nicely supported by the data.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.760]   - Well, I need to get, I need to get doing it more.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.560]   I've had a couple of scary experiences
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:02.380]   going from hot to cold where blood pressure changes,
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:05.060]   I think where I basically went straight
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.900]   from a really hot jacuzzi.
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.620]   I was in there for like 30 minutes.
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:09.900]   I mean, I was doing heat stress.
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:10.740]   - Jacuzzi, okay.
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.520]   - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:13.360]   - That's toasty.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:14.820]   - And then I had for 30 minutes.
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.140]   And then I went straight into, at the time,
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.140]   it was our pool, it was in like February,
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:23.220]   it was like winter time and it was 50,
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:24.960]   it was in the 50s, it was cold.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.900]   And I was in there and I was like listening
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:31.060]   to Simon Garfunkel, I was like trying to stay in a long time,
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.540]   get on my cold and I was trying to impress Dan
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:34.220]   'cause he like goes in there for like,
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.220]   he'll stay in there for like 15 minutes.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:40.640]   But I started to feel really like blinky,
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.940]   like low blood pressure or something and I got scared.
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:46.600]   I got out and then I couldn't stand like I had vertigo
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.480]   or something and I was so scared, I was so scared.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:53.880]   And I've had a couple of times too where just going straight
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.040]   from the sauna to it, to the cold plunge,
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.160]   where I'm starting to feel, I'm like,
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.540]   ooh, I feel a little blood pressure change or something.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:04.620]   And it makes sense, the sauna is causing vasodilation
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:07.320]   and the cold plunge or cold exposure
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.340]   is causing vasoconstriction.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:12.980]   So it's like a very, just shock to my system.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:16.380]   And so now I wait, like I wait like a few minutes
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:19.420]   before going in but I do need to kind of like make it more,
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:22.280]   the cold more routine because I talk all about the science,
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:25.700]   I'm familiar with all the science and the norepinephrine
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:29.500]   or noradrenaline, it's affecting brain and mood
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.980]   and you know way more about that than I do.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:34.740]   I know how I feel and I know it's a neurotransmitter
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:38.780]   and it is released, at least in rats they've shown
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:40.340]   or it wasn't mice, I think it might've been rats,
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.860]   but multiple studies showing in that it's released
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:44.300]   from the cold in the brain.
[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:46.060]   - And now in humans as well.
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:46.900]   - Oh, in the brain they've shown?
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:49.340]   - So in that study, we can put a link to this,
[01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:52.740]   it's published in 2000, European Journal of Physiology,
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:53.900]   that big dopamine increase.
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:55.980]   They also looked at epinephrine and cortisol
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:58.020]   and saw some really, yeah, so this has been done-
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:58:58.860]   - They did brain?
[01:58:58.860 --> 01:58:59.700]   Oh, I didn't realize. - Oh, no, no, not yet.
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:01.540]   - The plasma. - No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:03.860]   Very hard to measure dopamine directly from the brain
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.060]   unless you're doing micro dialysis.
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:08.460]   No, unfortunately their skulls were intact.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.580]   Fortunately for them,
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:11.060]   unfortunately for the research committee,
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:13.460]   their skulls were intact so they couldn't measure directly
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:17.700]   in the brain, but obviously there's a correlate there.
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:20.700]   You know, it's a very real effect.
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.380]   I think that, but the advantage of not doing it too often
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:27.300]   is that you're not cold adapted.
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:30.460]   Now it's very hard for anyone to get truly cold adapted.
[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:32.500]   Some people start to look forward to the cold
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.860]   and what I think they're looking forward to
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:37.600]   is the feeling afterward, that dopamine rush.
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.640]   But if you get cold adapted,
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.860]   then it certainly blunts some of the effect.
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.360]   - But I want to be cold adapted
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.940]   because that means I have more mitochondria
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:50.460]   in my adipose tissue and perhaps even muscle,
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:51.940]   like that's been shown.
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.200]   - So maybe there's a good opportunity to,
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:57.380]   so cold and UCP1, if you could educate us on UCP1,
[01:59:57.380 --> 01:59:58.340]   I find this really interesting.
[01:59:58.340 --> 01:59:59.820]   And I learned about it from you, so.
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:02.200]   - Yeah, well, so norepinephrine
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.500]   actually released in the plasma.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:05.460]   It does act as a hormone.
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:06.980]   Vasoconstriction is one thing it does,
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:11.000]   but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.500]   that have to do with adaption to cold.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:16.560]   One happening to be, you know,
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.760]   shivering is a very inefficient way to produce heat,
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:20.840]   which is what your body's trying to do
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:22.220]   when it's exposed to cold.
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:24.380]   And your muscles are basically contracting
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.960]   and producing heat from that,
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.420]   but that's just not very efficient.
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:31.260]   So the more eloquent way to do it,
[02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:33.160]   or elegant, I guess, way to do it
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.200]   is to basically have your mitochondria produce
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.720]   tons and tons of heat.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:41.880]   So the way it does this is by activating a gene
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.640]   called UCP1, uncoupling protein one,
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.760]   norepinephrine is upstream of that, activating it.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.800]   So what that does is essentially,
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.920]   so mitochondria are these little organelles
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:54.360]   inside of your cells that are responsible
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:55.400]   for producing energy.
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:00.080]   Usually that's in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.240]   and that's what lets everything function
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:04.640]   inside of your body, from your neurotransmitter production
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:07.120]   to your heart beating, et cetera.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:10.560]   However, you can uncouple your mitochondria.
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:13.900]   Basically your mitochondria, they're like a little battery.
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:16.520]   So they have, well, they have a double membrane,
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:17.440]   first of all, their structure,
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:19.800]   but they have a negative charge on the inside,
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.600]   and they have a positive charge on the inner membrane.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:26.840]   So in between the outer membrane and inside, the inside part.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.940]   - Like a neuron.
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:28.780]   - Like a neuron, yeah.
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:30.060]   So I guess it's like a neuron.
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:31.880]   It's like a battery, negative and positive.
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:34.120]   So basically you can uncouple that charge,
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.720]   and so that positive charge protons
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:37.400]   start leaking out of the mitochondria,
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.040]   and your mitochondria freak out.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.400]   So this is called uncoupling it.
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:45.300]   And they start to, it's maximum respiration as we call it.
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:47.400]   They try to make as much energy.
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.920]   They're like, I gotta get that proton back,
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.120]   that gradient, the electrochemical gradient.
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:54.520]   And so they just go insane,
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:56.720]   and they, in this case, it's uncoupled energy.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.280]   So the energy they're making is actually heat, not ATP.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.400]   But heat is, but you're essentially burning substrate,
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:04.240]   so who cares?
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:07.880]   You're burning glucose, you're burning lipids,
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:10.480]   you're basically burning things and making heat.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.740]   And so that's what uncoupling it does,
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:14.600]   and that is a much more efficient way
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:16.440]   of producing heat than shivering.
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:19.120]   So as you become more adapted,
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.400]   maybe the longer duration that you've stayed in the cold
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.640]   or the more times you've done it,
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.480]   you'll no longer shiver anymore.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:28.060]   You will start to then just do this uncoupling type
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:30.160]   of thermogenesis as it's called.
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:33.360]   And another type of adaptation that occurs
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.800]   is you actually produce more mitochondria
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.520]   in your adipose tissue.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.600]   And that actually happens also regulated
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.640]   by norepinephrine or noradrenaline
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.600]   through a protein called PGC1 alpha.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:51.600]   And what that protein does is it makes more mitochondria
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:53.420]   in your adipose cells.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:55.840]   So per adipose cell, you're getting more mitochondria.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.320]   It's a beautiful way to basically make more heat
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:00.760]   when you're, it's one of those things
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.960]   where it's like your body's going,
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:05.400]   okay, I'm gonna be exposed to this cold next time.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.640]   How can I make sure I don't die?
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:09.320]   Oh, I can have more mitochondria
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.360]   and I'm gonna make more heat.
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.360]   And so you're making more mitochondria
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.440]   in your adipose tissue.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:17.080]   And this is often referred to as like the browning of fat.
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:18.940]   And the reason for that is because if you look
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:21.600]   under a microscope at a lipid drop,
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:26.600]   basically a fat cell, not a lipid drop, adipocyte,
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:29.520]   you'll find that it looks darker
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:31.340]   because there's more mitochondria in there.
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:33.840]   So it's referred to as browning fat.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:37.680]   And so I don't want to get into the whole beige fat, brown.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.800]   You know, there's this whole,
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.840]   I'm sure you've had experts on that talk all about that.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:41.680]   - No, not yet.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.760]   I mean, I always think of white fat, beige fat, brown fat.
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:45.240]   And beige is kind of intermediate.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:46.960]   White can be converted into beige, but-
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.040]   - Right, and beige can take on
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:50.200]   thermogenic characteristics essentially.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.400]   And so you can activate beige fat so that it's thermogenic
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.280]   in the sense that it's burning glucose
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.100]   and or fatty acids and producing heat.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:05.580]   So the more you expose yourself to cold,
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:08.480]   the more you can brown your fat, so to speak.
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.400]   And therefore you can tolerate the cold for longer periods,
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.000]   which people do notice.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.560]   And you can then have the thermogenic qualities
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:20.280]   of having more brown adipose tissue or beige,
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.100]   activated beige adipose tissue,
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:25.160]   which is, you'll get a lot of naysayers out there saying,
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:28.860]   "Oh, brown fat doesn't regulate metabolism at all."
[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:31.220]   And the reality is there's like thousands of researchers
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:35.140]   trying to pill up brown fat and thermogenic,
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:36.700]   like they're trying to make it a pill
[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:39.220]   because it does affect metabolism.
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:40.240]   It's not the only thing.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.980]   It's certainly, if you're obese and trying to lose weight,
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:45.820]   you're not gonna do that just by doing cold exposure.
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:50.060]   You need to do dietary and exercise changes predominantly.
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:52.520]   But it does affect metabolism.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:56.660]   And this has been shown in human studies.
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:59.420]   So it is interesting.
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:04.260]   It's another possible mechanism for affecting metabolism.
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:05.980]   And that's an adipose tissue.
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:09.620]   But you also make more mitochondria and muscle tissue.
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:12.380]   And this is regulated not via norepinephrine,
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:14.620]   but it is still PGC1 alpha, interestingly.
[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:17.460]   Not that anyone else really cares,
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.820]   but maybe you do, Andrew.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:21.520]   - I'm eating this up.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:26.020]   - So PGC1 alpha is response to norepinephrine
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:28.180]   and adipose tissue to make more mitochondria.
[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:32.340]   But in muscle tissue, it's unclear what the regulator is.
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.500]   Cold exposure does it.
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:37.700]   So this was shown at least in a couple of studies I've seen
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:40.540]   where people that were exercising, I believe,
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:42.060]   or maybe it may have been men only
[02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:44.080]   that were exercising did some sort of training.
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:46.340]   And then did cold water immersion,
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:49.420]   something like 50 degrees Fahrenheit, 15 minutes.
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:51.500]   And PGC1 alpha, which is a biomarker
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:52.940]   for mitochondrial biogenesis,
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:55.260]   which is the generation of new mitochondria.
[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:56.660]   By the way, that's awesome.
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.160]   You want more mitochondria in your muscle.
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:01.060]   It's associated with improved muscle mass,
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.100]   improved endurance.
[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.500]   I mean, mitochondria are essentially
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:05.860]   either than making energy in your cell.
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:09.220]   And we don't make more mitochondria normally.
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:10.700]   Like you have certain inputs,
[02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:13.060]   high intensity interval training exercise can do it.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:14.900]   - And actually make more mitochondria.
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:17.540]   - Yes, yeah, and that's been shown in people.
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:20.460]   - Weight training or just high intensity interval training?
[02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:23.260]   - I haven't seen weight training.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:25.460]   I've seen it in high intensity interval training,
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:27.300]   endurance training,
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:29.380]   but that doesn't mean that it hasn't been shown.
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:31.180]   I just haven't seen it or that it hasn't been looked at.
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:32.020]   - It's good to know.
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:36.300]   I'm always looking for reasons to finally do more HIIT type
[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:37.600]   high intensity interval training work.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.340]   I do weight training and I do low intensity cardio.
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:43.340]   - There was a brilliant study by,
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:45.840]   at the time he was a postdoc, Matthew Robinson,
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.920]   and he's now gone on to start his own lab
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:53.500]   at the University of Oregon Health Science Center.
[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:54.960]   - Great place, yeah.
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:59.960]   - And he did a study where both young and older people,
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:02.500]   they had this whole high intensity protocol,
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:03.800]   which I can't remember what it was,
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.140]   but their protocol for X amount of time,
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:09.000]   I'm sure it was at least a month,
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.420]   they then measured biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis
[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:14.260]   in their muscle tissue.
[02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:17.560]   And the amount of mitochondrial biogenesis
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.120]   in old people specifically,
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:20.880]   it happened in both young and old from HIIT,
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:23.020]   from the high intensity interval training was,
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:26.940]   I mean, it was like enormous, at least 50% I think.
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:28.960]   So I mean, it was just like, whoa.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:30.620]   And so like, why would you want that?
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:34.680]   Well, you know, mitochondria, you don't make,
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.620]   your cells are turning over, you make new cells,
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:39.040]   you replace old ones with your mitochondria.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.620]   You don't really do that for the most part, you can.
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.160]   Mitochondrial biogenesis does happen,
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:45.180]   but you have to stimulate it to happen.
[02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:46.820]   And the way your mitochondria,
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:48.220]   like what happens with your mitochondria
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:50.760]   is they essentially are bobbing around inside of your cells,
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:53.740]   and then they fuse with other mitochondria,
[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:55.700]   exchange all their content and mitochondrial DNA,
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:56.580]   and then fizz back apart.
[02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:58.820]   And that's how they kind of stay young-ish.
[02:07:58.820 --> 02:07:59.820]   But like as you age,
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:02.660]   you keep doing that with the same pool of mitochondria,
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:04.260]   then you're gonna get a bunch of old mitochondria
[02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.200]   mixing old stuff together, right?
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:10.340]   So why wouldn't you wanna like bring up new, healthy,
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:13.440]   young mitochondria into that pool, right?
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:16.140]   So in my mind, when I hear mitochondrial biogenesis,
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:19.100]   I'm like aging, like that's the first thing I think of.
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:20.840]   So anyways, cold exposure does that,
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:23.140]   other things as well, so.
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:26.780]   - You know, and please, thank you for offering to,
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:29.240]   you know, somehow filter the level of detail,
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:31.820]   but I assure you that listeners of this podcast
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:34.040]   are familiar with getting,
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.100]   drinking from the fire hose of mechanism,
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:37.700]   and that was really helpful.
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:40.780]   And again, this is just one example of maybe four
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:43.580]   or five other things that you've said at least
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:46.300]   that are gonna inspire me to change my behaviors.
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:48.100]   I'm gonna start doing some high intensity interval training.
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:50.820]   Dr. Andy Galpin was on this podcast recently,
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:53.540]   and he told me that the subtle zone two cardio
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:54.780]   and the weight training is great,
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:55.940]   but that I really should be doing
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:58.740]   some max heart rate work per week,
[02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:00.760]   you know, going into max heart rate for 90 seconds
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.660]   and resting and repeating that, maybe even mild repeats.
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:05.180]   I'm just curious as a brief aside
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:06.740]   before we talk about heat,
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:11.020]   what sort of cardiovascular
[02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:13.020]   or other types of training do you do?
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:13.860]   Do you do HIIT?
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:16.020]   I imagine you are doing high intensity interval training.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:18.100]   If you could just give us a sense of the contour
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:20.460]   of your week as it relates to exercise
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:22.620]   and because you've been very gracious
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:24.980]   in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food,
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:26.980]   what about exercise?
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:29.420]   - So I, it all depends on my week, of course,
[02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:31.900]   and what I've got going on with my son
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:33.900]   and my work schedule, but I typically,
[02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:37.500]   I do a lot of high intensity interval Tabatas
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:38.700]   on a stationary cycle.
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:43.280]   I use Peloton because I just like that instructor there,
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:44.120]   like telling me what to do
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:45.540]   and then me competing with everyone else.
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:46.620]   I'm like, nah, you know?
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:47.460]   So it works.
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:48.940]   - You're revealing something about your psychology.
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:49.760]   This is good.
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.600]   We just learned about,
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.700]   so this podcast is actually just a decoy
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:55.140]   for a psychological assessment of the guests.
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:56.100]   No, I'm kidding.
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:57.580]   But so now we know you're competitive.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:58.620]   Good? - Yeah.
[02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:00.780]   - That explains a lot of how you got
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:03.340]   through graduate school and then do what you do.
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:04.700]   So you're getting on the Peloton
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:05.540]   and what does it look like
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:07.260]   for someone who's not familiar with Peloton?
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:10.260]   I know what they are, but I've never been on one.
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.520]   You are pedaling against the instructor
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:13.620]   for how many seconds?
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:16.300]   - So there's a bunch of people that are online
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:18.460]   either doing the class with you at the same time
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.220]   or have all time doing it
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:22.900]   so you can kind of toggle on what you want
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:24.700]   and you can try to compete against the all time number.
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:25.980]   - Oh, so it's really competitive.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:26.980]   - Oh, yeah. - Okay.
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:29.360]   - And the instructor is just there to whip you,
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:33.640]   like, you know, make you, there's a part of,
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:38.120]   the brilliance with Peloton is like I used to do rush,
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:39.640]   what's called rush cycle and I used to go
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:41.980]   and it's basically you go in and group cycle
[02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:42.920]   and have an instructor there
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.960]   and you do all this high intensity interval training stuff.
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:48.920]   And I loved it because there was a competitive aspect to it
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:52.160]   that had me working harder than I would work
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.360]   if it was just me in the room,
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:56.200]   like without an instructor or anyone there.
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:59.320]   And it was just like, I'm at a gym, any gym,
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:00.720]   and I'm just on a stationary cycle
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:02.040]   listening to a podcast, doing something,
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:03.880]   which is fine if that's your group, right?
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:07.600]   But there is something about that group setting
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:10.800]   that kind of holds you accountable too, right?
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.720]   And the Peloton made it somehow virtual, it was amazing.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.440]   And I remember being back at rush cycle,
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:17.640]   this is before a pandemic
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.600]   and people talking about Peloton in my class
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:21.240]   and I'm like, oh, that's ridiculous, why would I do that?
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.920]   Like, that's never gonna work, I need to like be here.
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:24.960]   And then the pandemic hit
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.160]   and I was like all over the Peloton
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:29.360]   and it works for me really well.
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:33.400]   So I tend to do that at least three times a week.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.960]   Sometimes I do it more, like I'll do four
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:38.720]   and I do a 10 minute, just 10,
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:41.120]   because it's efficient and I push my ass,
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.640]   I push myself really hard.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.480]   - That's the Tabata.
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:46.800]   - It's 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off and it's 10 minutes.
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:48.040]   - And on means you're pedaling
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:48.860]   like your life depended on it.
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:50.040]   - You're maxing it.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:52.200]   - And there's a lot of resistance in the pedals?
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:53.920]   - Well, so you basically, there's a part where you're,
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.880]   I always do resistance, I'm like the power,
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:57.600]   I do the power for, there's a part
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:59.040]   where you're sitting cycling
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:00.120]   and you're trying to go really fast,
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:01.640]   but I always crank the resistance up.
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.440]   I always go above what they give me.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:06.000]   And then there's a part where you're standing
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.580]   and then you really crank the resistance up,
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:09.520]   which I really do and like you feel it in your glutes.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:10.400]   - It's like going up a hill.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:11.240]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:12.240]   And so they like break it up
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:15.200]   and most of the time you'll have like those two parts.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.440]   And I love the efficiency of it.
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.980]   You just, you get it done
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:21.120]   and people sometimes hear me go 10 minutes
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:22.020]   or really you think you work.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:24.860]   And I'm like, look, like you max, you do max,
[02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:28.220]   you do Tabata for 10 minutes and it's like, it's intense.
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:29.480]   - Yeah, most people can't sprint
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:32.340]   for the gate of an airplane
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:35.060]   they're about to miss carrying a backpack.
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:37.140]   So if you think about, if I think about that
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.180]   and then I've just described myself
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.760]   sprinting through the airport and going,
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:43.280]   all right, Andy Galpin, I got my 90 seconds max heart rate
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:45.600]   in for you carrying this thing.
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:48.260]   But 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off,
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:50.240]   repeating that over and over for 10 minutes.
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.040]   So by the time you're done, you're cooked.
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:54.820]   - And then I, because I'm competitive during the recovery
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:56.160]   that they give you at the minute at the end,
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.100]   I'm pushing it max.
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:58.800]   'Cause I want to keep the numbers higher.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:00.780]   - Great, so three times a week?
[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:01.700]   - Yeah, three times a week.
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:04.940]   And then I always have my sauna on preheating up.
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:06.020]   It takes about an hour and a half
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:09.100]   and I get it to about 189 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:12.620]   I hop right in the sauna after my Peloton.
[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:14.140]   - So the elevated heart rate continues?
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.220]   Is that the rationale?
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.780]   - I mean, I literally like down a bunch of water
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:22.780]   and then I get in and then I either read a science paper,
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:25.500]   prepare for a presentation or a podcast,
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:28.760]   or I hash over things in my mind.
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:33.240]   And it's interesting because something about getting
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:37.160]   in the sauna, I think the stress, the heat stress of it,
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:40.800]   so I started doing the sauna in 2009 in graduate school.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.440]   Okay, and I-- - You're a early adopter.
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:44.280]   - I started doing it every day.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:45.120]   I lived across the street.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:47.440]   I lived in a studio apartment with Dan.
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:50.520]   I lived in the smallest apartment you could ever imagine.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.700]   And it was across the street from a YMCA
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:54.200]   'cause I was poor in graduate school.
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:55.200]   Very poor, very poor.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:01.000]   - I recall, I recall being, I lived in my lab.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.260]   - Wow, really? - But then again,
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:05.180]   I lived in my lab as a postdoc and as a, I admit,
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:08.480]   I lived in my lab with my bulldog as a faculty member
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:11.260]   for other reasons, but I get it.
[02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:12.920]   When you're a graduate student, you're poor.
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:16.920]   - Yes, and so I used to go to the sauna
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.920]   before going into the lab and I started noticing
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:26.360]   that I was all of a sudden able to handle stress better,
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.280]   like the stress of my six-month setback
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:33.440]   because of a failed experiment, which is crushing
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.440]   on top of the pressure from your, my advisor
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:40.120]   and my own pressure 'cause I'm very competitive
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.520]   with myself and I put a lot of pressure on myself.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:43.840]   So I was having a hard time.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:45.480]   I mean, I was very stressed out in graduate school
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:50.480]   and the sauna started to really noticeably affect my anxiety
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:52.480]   and my ability to handle stress.
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.040]   And I was like, what is going on here?
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:57.000]   So I started looking into the literature
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.160]   and started getting interested in the effects on the brain.
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:03.440]   And in fact, at the time I had a friend
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:05.760]   who was not actually experimentally,
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.760]   but theoretically looking into the opioid system
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.680]   and basically, so when you get in the sauna,
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:16.000]   you release a lot of endorphins.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.520]   Endorphins are the feel-good opioids
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.160]   that make you feel good.
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:24.280]   But you also release something called dynorphin.
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:26.920]   And dynorphin is an endogenous opioid
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.880]   that binds to a receptor called the kappa opioid receptor,
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:34.800]   which dynorphin is responsible for that dysphoric feeling
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.320]   when you're in the sauna and you're hot
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.040]   and when you're running, doing exercise
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.560]   and you're like, you feel uncomfortable.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:44.280]   Well, I think that's dynorphin, I'm speaking in absolute--
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:45.240]   - No, I think it is. - I think it is.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:48.280]   - I mean, there's evidence in alcoholics
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:50.280]   that some of the symptoms of withdrawal
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.600]   that they experience are related to dynorphin.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:56.360]   And dynorphin is known to negatively impact
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.600]   the dopamine receptor system.
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:01.240]   So basically, it's the feel like garbage pathway.
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:02.160]   - Right, you feel like garbage.
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:05.800]   And so you think that that would not be good,
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:08.200]   but this is where my friend that comes in,
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:12.560]   he was looking at the effects of treating morphine
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:16.160]   or heroin addiction and people that are using those drugs,
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:21.160]   they basically, the endorphins or the morphine or heroin,
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.320]   they bind to a receptor in the brain
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.120]   called the mu opioid receptor.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.720]   And as they take these drugs,
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:31.720]   that mu opioid receptor becomes down-regulated
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.520]   and so you need more and more of the drug
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:35.880]   to feel as good as you did, right?
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:38.440]   Well, endorphins also bind to that receptor.
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:42.040]   And he was looking into some of the other drugs
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:46.920]   or like salvinorum or something, the salvia, it's called.
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:49.320]   It binds to the opioid receptor.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:50.840]   It also makes you kind of feel uncomfortable.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:54.560]   Anyways, he had put some studies in front of me
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:59.560]   that showed basically binding of either dynorphin
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.000]   or whatever ligand to the kappa opioid receptor
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.080]   basically sensitizes the mu opioid receptor
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:08.840]   to the feel-good endorphins and also changes.
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.680]   I think it also up-regulates it or something.
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:14.040]   So basically, there's a lasting effect of feeling good.
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:15.720]   So the endorphins that you release later
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:18.720]   from hugging someone or a joke you're laughing at
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.000]   or whatever, you feel it for longer, right?
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.920]   And so anyways, with respect to the sauna,
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.480]   it's a big sort of hypothesis of mine.
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.680]   I did kind of publish that part of my hypothesis
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:33.640]   in a review article, but I do wish more people
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:34.680]   would kind of look into that.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:36.880]   That'd be amazing.
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:38.520]   But what I was getting at, I think,
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:43.520]   was I would use the sauna to memorize things.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:46.720]   This is way back in the day, and I still do it.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:48.200]   And I wanted to talk to you about this
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.880]   because you're a neuroscientist,
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:54.720]   that there's something about being in the sauna,
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.360]   and I don't know if it has to do with the stress response.
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:00.880]   Like when you have an emotional trigger,
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.640]   like you remember things better, right?
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:03.480]   - Absolutely.
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.280]   There is a clear and known explanation mechanism for this.
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:12.120]   So in the sauna, I mean, you also release norepinephrine,
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:13.120]   just like you do in the cold.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:14.320]   There's a lot of overlap.
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:16.880]   You know, I mean, it is a stressor,
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:20.520]   but I like use it to remember things.
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:21.640]   Like I'm going through something.
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:23.440]   I want to go through a presentation or a talk
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:24.880]   or a podcast or whatever.
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:27.520]   And I go in that sauna and I mean, you should try it.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:28.880]   Like if you haven't already, I don't know if you have.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.560]   - I have a sauna and a cold plunge now,
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.240]   and I haven't tried prepare.
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:34.560]   I read books in the sauna in the evening.
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:37.760]   It's a time I insist on having my phone out of there.
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:39.840]   Mostly because I initially,
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.400]   because I thought I'd cook the phone,
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.360]   but also just to get some separation from the phone
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:44.200]   and screens in the evening.
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:45.160]   So I read books.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:46.760]   The only challenge sometimes you're dripping sweat
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:48.040]   onto the books, but I'm willing to forego
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:50.080]   a few pages of a book.
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:55.080]   The idea that being in this semi-stressful environment
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:58.800]   would aid in the learning and retention of information
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:01.560]   is really well substantiated by this beautiful work
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:02.960]   by a guy named James McGaugh.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.240]   I don't know if his lab's still active,
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:06.760]   but he was at UC Irvine for a while.
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:10.400]   And then I think at University of Arizona as well.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.500]   They have a great memory group at both places,
[02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:15.360]   very strong in learning and memory in both places.
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:18.200]   And he was the one that really defined this
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:20.820]   kind of inverted U-shaped function
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:24.200]   for the relationship between adrenaline and memory.
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:27.880]   Basically, if you're too relaxed and not stressed enough,
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.880]   you're not gonna remember any information.
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:34.720]   At peak levels of stress, you actually are a memory machine,
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:36.320]   at least within the context of whatever it is
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:37.280]   you're trying to learn.
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:41.320]   So, what you're describing very well matches with that.
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:42.480]   And then, of course, it tapers off
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:45.080]   as you really increase adrenaline to the point
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:47.520]   where people are starting to lose autonomic function,
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:49.900]   where they're panicking, basically.
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:51.280]   But obviously, you're keeping it in range.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:53.280]   The other thing that I would like to ask you about
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.480]   is in the sauna, of course, there's vasodilation.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:57.000]   And perfusion of blood to the brain
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.920]   is a wonderful way to enhance cognition.
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:00.720]   There's even some really nice data showing
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:03.720]   that during inhales, as opposed to exhales,
[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:06.840]   people are better at learning information.
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:08.400]   Believe it or not, during the inhale,
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:10.640]   you're taking in and absorbing and remembering more
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.520]   than during exhales.
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:15.120]   And these are beautiful studies done in humans, of course.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:17.800]   So, I can imagine that vasodilation,
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:19.640]   getting more perfusion of blood to the brain,
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:22.440]   plus a little bit of stress, or maybe a lot of stress
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:25.940]   from the epinephrine, and then, of course,
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:27.840]   there's gonna be the, I don't wanna call it placebo,
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:29.720]   but there's gonna be the context,
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.040]   the conditioned place context of it.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.080]   If we had a good experience remembering something
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:37.600]   in the sauna once, the positive association effect
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:38.800]   of that location is real.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.200]   Just like if people go to a new city and they get robbed,
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.360]   like if you go to Cincinnati,
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:44.200]   I've never been to Cincinnati,
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:45.400]   but you get robbed in Cincinnati,
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:47.240]   your purse gets taken or your wallet gets taken,
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:49.440]   you kind of hate Cincinnati as a tourist,
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.960]   but that could happen in any number of different cities.
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:53.380]   The opposite is also true.
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:55.120]   So, if something good happens someplace.
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:57.280]   So, I'm imagining that it's a combination of those effects,
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:59.280]   but I'll start, it would be very hard
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:00.800]   to do this in the cold.
[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:03.160]   I feel like the cold is a very potent,
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:04.920]   I think it takes you too far down that curve,
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:05.760]   the McGaugh curve.
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.560]   - I have to sing songs or something when I'm in it.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.120]   - Distract yourself. - Oh, yeah, I sing songs.
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:10.800]   - But afterward, you're very efficient at learning.
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:13.500]   - After I am, and with respect to the sauna,
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:15.360]   the vasodilation does occur,
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:16.720]   so there's a lot of overlap
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:20.420]   between moderate intensity aerobic exercise and heat stress,
[02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:22.320]   and as you can imagine, when you're exercising,
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:24.560]   you're elevating your core body temperature,
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:28.400]   you're sweating, and when you're actually in the sauna,
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:31.360]   blood does get redistributed to the skin
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:34.880]   to facilitate sweating, but much like exercise,
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:37.200]   blood flow in general is improved,
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.600]   to the brain, to the muscles, everywhere.
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:42.880]   So, I think generally speaking that,
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:45.760]   and there's studies showing that sauna use
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:47.960]   is associated with a much lower risk
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:49.400]   of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:52.220]   Like people that use it four to seven times a week
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:55.680]   have greater than 60% reduction in dementia
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:57.760]   and Alzheimer's disease risk compared to once.
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:59.000]   - Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.680]   You said people who use it, I apologize,
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:02.980]   but maybe you tell us again,
[02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:05.880]   people who use it four to seven times per week have?
[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:08.920]   - They have a greater than 60% reduction
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.360]   in dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:14.280]   compared to people that use it only one time a week.
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:16.280]   People that use it two to three times a week
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:19.840]   have something like a little greater than 20% reduction
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:22.320]   in risk, so there's a dose-dependent effect
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:25.440]   on dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:29.240]   It also has a profound, there's a big link
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:31.840]   between the cardiovascular system and the brain.
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:34.140]   Obviously, blood flow, a big one, right?
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.000]   You need to get blood to your brain.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.720]   But cardiovascular mortality,
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:42.020]   so mortality from cardiovascular disease,
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:43.760]   if people use, or actually this was men,
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:46.400]   if men use the sauna four to seven times a week,
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:50.140]   it's a 50% reduction in cardiovascular-related mortality
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:51.800]   compared to one time a week.
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:54.260]   Again, dose-dependent manner two to three times a week
[02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:58.940]   is something like 24% death from cardiovascular disease.
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:02.120]   There's also lower, sudden cardiac death,
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:04.320]   so like a heart attack, that's like 60-something,
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:07.480]   greater than 60% lower if men use it
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:09.440]   four to seven times a week versus once.
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:10.720]   Again, a dose-dependent thing.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:13.880]   And the thing that's so profound there also to me,
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:16.720]   again, looking at the methods, when I look at the data,
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:19.480]   and this is all work from Dr. Jari Laukonen.
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:22.680]   He's in the University of Eastern Finland
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:25.920]   and just one of the world experts on sauna use,
[02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:28.040]   especially with respect to cardiovascular health.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:31.640]   What some of his data has also shown is that
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:34.200]   if you look at the duration, the time spent in the sauna,
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:36.240]   so a lot of the, so I mentioned the temperature I do
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.420]   is about, I do like 189 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:42.860]   Typically I go in there, I'm pretty heat-adapted.
[02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:46.120]   And so the more you do, the more you do the sauna
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:47.680]   or any sort of heat stress,
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:51.260]   whether it's a hot tub or jacuzzi, you become adapted.
[02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:53.900]   You basically start to sweat at a lower core body temperature
[02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:55.180]   to cool yourself down.
[02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:56.560]   All these sort of physiological changes
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:58.340]   start to happen earlier.
[02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:01.540]   And so I stay in for like 30 minutes.
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:03.020]   So I stay in a long time.
[02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:03.860]   That's a lot.
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:04.860]   You have to listen to your body.
[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:07.140]   Most of the studies that I just talked about
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:11.340]   were from the duration, the time spent in the sauna,
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:13.020]   when I said 50% reduction
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.620]   in cardiovascular disease-related death.
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:18.020]   What was shown was that men that were in the sauna
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:20.580]   for only 11 minutes, even if they used it
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:21.620]   four to seven times a week,
[02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:24.780]   that reduction was only like 8% instead of 50.
[02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:28.220]   It had to be greater than 19 minutes,
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:29.900]   so like 20 minutes is the sweet spot,
[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:33.340]   at about 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:36.580]   And most of the saunas in Finland, by the way,
[02:24:36.580 --> 02:24:41.580]   they're humid, so they put hot water on hot rocks
[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:43.660]   to create steam.
[02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:46.700]   And so it's usually between 10 to 20% humidity
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:48.100]   in the finished sauna.
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:50.860]   So those studies were, I would say, most of the time
[02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:53.620]   you're gonna find that their humidity is also elevated.
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:56.740]   But to me, the dose-dependent nature of it
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:01.740]   and the duration, to me, that's a very strong data
[02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:05.740]   that this is more causal than some corollary thing,
[02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:07.340]   because that's always the problem
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.900]   with observational studies, including these,
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:12.340]   which they corrected for a whole host of factors,
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:15.340]   like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:16.220]   everything under the sun.
[02:25:16.220 --> 02:25:17.380]   I mean, they corrected for those.
[02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:19.980]   And on top of that, you have the dose-dependent nature
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:22.060]   of the duration, the time spent in the sauna,
[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:23.540]   and the frequency.
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:26.220]   So to me, it's like, something's going on here.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:28.180]   Plus, there's been studies, intervention studies,
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:31.060]   where it's like comparing directly head-to-head
[02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:34.520]   moderate intensity aerobic exercise on a stationary cycle
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:37.020]   to 20 minutes in a sauna.
[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:39.560]   They're physiologically, the same things happen.
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:44.380]   So heart rate elevates while you're doing the activity.
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:46.460]   Blood pressure increases while you're doing the activity.
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.300]   Then after, heart rate decreases,
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.660]   resting heart rate decreases below baseline.
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:54.420]   Blood pressure is improved, so it decreases below baseline.
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:55.620]   This is happening the same
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:58.260]   in moderate intensity cycling versus sauna.
[02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:01.060]   So again, this sauna, this heat stress,
[02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:03.820]   there's something about it that really mimics
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:06.440]   this moderate intensity aerobic exercise,
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:10.280]   which is really great for people that can't go for a run,
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:12.420]   that can't even get on a bike.
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:15.640]   So disabled people, granted there are some safety concerns,
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:18.820]   they're pretty mild, but they do exist.
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:20.320]   So people that had a recent heart attack
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:23.320]   or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem,
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:24.480]   drinking alcohol, never do that.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:27.360]   Elderly people prone to low blood pressure,
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:29.700]   always talk to a physician before doing the sauna.
[02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:31.020]   It is stressful.
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:31.860]   - Pregnant.
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:34.320]   - Pregnant women, yeah, I definitely avoided saunas
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.320]   when I was pregnant.
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:39.540]   But it is, I think it's very relevant for disabled people
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.200]   and also people that are sedentary,
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.340]   have been sedentary most of their life.
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:45.920]   Like my mother, I've been able to get her in the sauna
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:49.460]   because she's not, I mean, I did get her on the Peloton once,
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:50.800]   but it's really much easier.
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:53.100]   She feels like it's a spa treatment
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:55.780]   and it's like she can listen to her music in there.
[02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:57.860]   And like I care about her health,
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:00.140]   but she's mostly been a sedentary person.
[02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:03.940]   And so I find it much easier to convince her
[02:27:03.940 --> 02:27:06.360]   to get in the sauna than to get on Peloton.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.420]   Ideally you do both.
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.080]   The question would be, well, I exercise, I run,
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.160]   I do my high intensity interval training,
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:13.880]   why do I need to get in the sauna?
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:17.280]   And the reality is, and so I published all this
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:21.320]   in a review in the experimental gerontology last year,
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:23.160]   I guess, late last year.
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:27.400]   And basically, cardiorespiratory fitness,
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:31.440]   which is a marker of, it's a marker of health.
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:34.480]   You know, cardiorespiratory fitness is improved
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.400]   in people that do exercise and sauna
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:40.040]   compared to exercise alone or sauna alone.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:43.000]   So for those healthy, fit people out there
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.360]   already exercising, there's a synergistic effect
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:49.880]   by also adding a sauna into that routine.
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:51.720]   And to me, that's great.
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:55.620]   And there's so many beneficial things happening
[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:57.320]   with the heat stress in addition
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:59.120]   to like mimicking aerobic exercise.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:00.260]   There's the heat check proteins
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:01.680]   that we talked about earlier.
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:03.440]   And those, it kind of brings me back
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.640]   to my early days of science
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:07.960]   when I was at the Salk Institute
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:09.960]   for Biological Studies doing research
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.080]   on little nematode worms that we,
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.820]   or someone else, injected amyloid beta-42,
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:21.160]   the peptide, the 42 amino acid peptide
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.840]   that is involved in amyloid plaques found in the brain
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:26.240]   correlated with Alzheimer's disease
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:28.200]   and other, you know, brain disorders.
[02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:31.500]   We injected those into the muscle tissue of worms.
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:34.720]   And basically, these worms become paralyzed with age
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:39.720]   because the aggregated proteins, these proteins aggregate.
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:41.400]   Well, heat shock proteins,
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:43.100]   one of the main things they do
[02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:45.140]   is they basically make sure the proteins
[02:28:45.140 --> 02:28:47.720]   inside of your cells maintain their proper
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:50.540]   three-dimensional structure and are folded right.
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:54.120]   And so they don't, they're not prone to aggregating
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:56.740]   and forming these plaques in your arteries
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:57.980]   and also in the brain.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:02.120]   And there's, back to my worm studies I was doing,
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:04.880]   I would elevate heat shock proteins in those worms
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:07.400]   and it would totally correct the problem
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.760]   where they would no longer become paralyzed.
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:11.120]   They'd move around like they were young.
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.360]   So many animal studies have been done
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.480]   looking at Alzheimer's disease,
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:20.260]   like a human-like Alzheimer's disease in a rodent
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:22.400]   and heat shock proteins protecting from it.
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.440]   So heat shock proteins are robustly activated in humans.
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:30.040]   This has been shown to even, you know,
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:33.640]   50% higher over baseline levels after just 30 minutes
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.620]   at 163 degrees Fahrenheit in the sauna.
[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:39.720]   So, and they stay activated at least in rodents
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:43.080]   for, you know, 48 hours at least.
[02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:46.960]   So, you know, having these heat shock proteins around,
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:50.040]   making sure they're properly taking care of our proteins
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:52.840]   so they're not aggregating in our brains and in our plaques
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:55.820]   could be another potential way that saunas protecting
[02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:58.960]   from Alzheimer's disease and other, you know,
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:01.760]   cardiovascular health as well as longevity.
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:05.240]   So, you know, there's people that have SNPs
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:08.140]   in heat shock protein factor 70
[02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:10.300]   that if they have one of them,
[02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:11.460]   so they got one from their parents
[02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:13.640]   where they have more active heat shock protein 70,
[02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:15.360]   they live on average one year longer
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:16.840]   than people that don't have that SNP.
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:18.160]   And if they have two versions,
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.360]   they got one from their mom and one from their dad,
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:21.760]   they live on average two years longer
[02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:23.020]   than people that don't have that SNP.
[02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:25.380]   So it's also been associated with human longevity
[02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:26.760]   as well as in lower organisms.
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:28.640]   So you can heat shock a worm or a fly
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:30.880]   and they live 15% longer.
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:32.480]   This is work done by Gordon Lithgow
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:34.780]   at the Buck Institute years and years ago.
[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:38.880]   So, anyways, I guess what I was getting at
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:41.440]   was the heat shock proteins are part
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:43.860]   of that stress response pathway that we talked about earlier
[02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:46.880]   and, you know, they're also activated by cold as well.
[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:49.080]   Cold shock does activate heat shock proteins.
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:50.000]   Not as robust.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.560]   Sulfuraphane activates them.
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:52.760]   Again, it's one of the reasons I think
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:54.280]   we should get all of these things
[02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:57.080]   because they are more robust inputs.
[02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.880]   You know, their input activating mechanisms
[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:02.080]   are more robust for different ones.
[02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:03.340]   So there is crosstalk.
[02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:06.880]   There is, you know, I mean, I guess it'd be more accurate
[02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:08.840]   to say there's overlap.
[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:12.240]   But, you know, it's also like you want to get
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:14.060]   the most robust from all of them, right?
[02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:14.900]   I do.
[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:18.120]   So, I mean, that's why I want to do the sauna and exercise
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:23.120]   and eat my broccoli sprouts and all that stuff, so.
[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:25.280]   - It's super interesting.
[02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:28.200]   A couple of questions came up for me.
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:33.160]   One is, you mentioned these SNPs, these nucleotide repeats,
[02:31:33.160 --> 02:31:34.760]   basically genes that some people have,
[02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:36.980]   more of or less of, than others
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:40.080]   that can predict longevity in some sense.
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:42.560]   Is that the FOXO3 pathway?
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:44.080]   - That's one that can, yeah.
[02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:47.360]   I mean, FOXO3 is, in fact, if you go back
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:48.860]   to the worm studies I was talking about,
[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:50.600]   that was like one of the first things
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.840]   when you see it with your own eyes,
[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:56.000]   you can take these worms that you basically decrease
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000]   their insulin signaling pathway and their IGF-1.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.520]   Worms have what are called homologous genes,
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:04.160]   so they have a lot of similarities to humans.
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:05.940]   They have an insulin-like receptor,
[02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:07.760]   they have an IGF-1-like receptor,
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:10.440]   and they make something like FOXO3, which we have.
[02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:13.320]   And basically, if you decrease
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:14.580]   that insulin signaling pathway,
[02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:17.360]   their FOXO3 is always active in those worms,
[02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:19.280]   and they live like 100% longer.
[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:21.180]   And not only do they live longer,
[02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:25.120]   I mean, they are like a very young worm.
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:26.920]   I mean, they are like, you look at this thing
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:28.440]   and you're like, this looks like the worm
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:30.960]   that was just born like hours ago.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:31.780]   What's going on?
[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:33.540]   This thing's at the end of its life.
[02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:36.960]   Now, as a side note, the thing that always got me on this
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:39.800]   was, by the way, this was discovered by Cynthia Kenyon,
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:42.200]   and this was like back in the '90s.
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:44.480]   And honestly, I'm not sure that anything
[02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:46.580]   has been as exciting in the worm world since then,
[02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:50.140]   but I thought, I mean, it was a really big finding.
[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:52.720]   The only caveat there is that the worms
[02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:55.720]   go through this dour, it's called a dour stage
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:57.340]   when this happens, when you decrease
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:32:58.960]   their insulin signaling and stuff.
[02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:01.400]   And they go into this metabolic stasis,
[02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:03.600]   like they're not eating as much or moving.
[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:05.560]   And so it's like, okay, well, they live 100% longer,
[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:08.640]   but they go into this weird state.
[02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:09.540]   - I know people like this.
[02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:13.280]   Some in the longevity community, they know who they are.
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:15.640]   But they'll get the last laugh 'cause I'll be dead,
[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:18.880]   well-fed, but dead, and they'll still be going.
[02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:23.460]   So in terms of the many data on sauna,
[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:27.420]   and I also just want to acknowledge these Finnish groups
[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:29.300]   that did this work, it's really pioneering, right?
[02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:30.540]   When you think 20 years ago,
[02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:32.760]   long before social media or any of this,
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:35.940]   and they're out there, up there, I should say,
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:38.220]   measuring cortisol and growth hormone
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:41.920]   and all this stuff in people getting in and out of sauna,
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:44.000]   very, very interesting.
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.020]   So 20 minutes seems like the threshold
[02:33:47.020 --> 02:33:52.020]   at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, more times per week
[02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:53.600]   seems to be better than fewer
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:56.980]   when in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk,
[02:33:56.980 --> 02:33:58.500]   according to what I just learned from you.
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:01.420]   - Four would be a good, I think, minimum effective dose.
[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:02.260]   - Four times a week.
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:04.100]   And you combine it with the cold.
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:06.700]   I've also seen a protocol where,
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:08.140]   it's a very extreme protocol,
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:09.920]   I don't recommend this to people right off the bat,
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:12.700]   where they had human subjects get into the sauna
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:14.400]   for 30 minutes, get out for five,
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.180]   30 minutes, get out for five, 30 minutes,
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:18.500]   for a total of two hours of exposure.
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:22.700]   But that was what led to these massive 16-fold increases
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:24.140]   in growth hormone.
[02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:27.180]   I actually have a, and they had to do it very seldom.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:28.300]   So it sounds like these protocols
[02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:31.340]   you're describing 20 minutes done four times per week,
[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:33.820]   far more reasonable for most people to access.
[02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:37.300]   But I know people are probably desperate to know
[02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:39.020]   what if they don't have a sauna?
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:40.700]   A sauna is kind of a unique item.
[02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:41.980]   So I have a couple of questions.
[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:43.440]   Can people use hot baths?
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:45.860]   With the appropriate warning, of course,
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:49.240]   that without getting into description of the mechanics
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:51.540]   and the underlying biology, it's pretty obvious
[02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:57.500]   that the testes, if they get too warm, you'll kill sperm.
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:00.480]   That's the reason why the testes are housed in a structure
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:02.220]   called the scrotum that can move around.
[02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:04.540]   So just to be, you know, here we are, biologists,
[02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:06.780]   just talking about realities here.
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:08.900]   So if you're trying to conceive children
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:10.820]   or keep your sperm healthy,
[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:13.260]   guys should probably stay out of warm, hot baths.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:14.780]   - For at least six months, that's been shown.
[02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:15.620]   - Six months.
[02:35:15.620 --> 02:35:20.620]   So sperm motility goes down and sperm production goes down,
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:23.420]   but that is completely like corrected
[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:25.740]   if they stay out of the sauna for six months.
[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:27.620]   So through six months later, it's back to normal.
[02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:28.460]   - Great.
[02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:29.940]   That's very useful information, I'm sure,
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:32.260]   to a number of people out there.
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:37.020]   So if people don't have access to a sauna,
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:38.340]   and we get this about cold too.
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:40.000]   You always say, what about cold showers?
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:40.840]   And I always say, well,
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:42.820]   the studies have mainly been done on immersion
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:45.540]   'cause it's hard to keep things controlled in cold showers.
[02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:46.980]   It just doesn't make for a very good experiment
[02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:49.100]   'cause you get a bigger person,
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:50.480]   the less of them is under the shower.
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:51.900]   And so it doesn't make for a good experiment.
[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:54.860]   So it's not as good as immersion, but with heat,
[02:35:54.860 --> 02:35:58.060]   I could imagine that a hot bath would work almost as well.
[02:35:58.060 --> 02:35:59.780]   - Yeah, so there's been some studies looking at,
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.660]   for example, activation of heat shock proteins,
[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:03.840]   also brain drive neurotrophic factor increases
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:04.980]   with heat stress.
[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:09.540]   And so the hot bath at around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:12.280]   which is typically what studies will use for temperature,
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.080]   which is actually cooler than when I crank my bath hot.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:15.920]   It's so hot.
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:17.780]   - But you're very heat adapted.
[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:19.120]   - I'm very heat adapted, yeah.
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:21.820]   And it's 20 minutes from the shoulders down.
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:25.220]   And that is a very robust activation in heat shock proteins
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:28.120]   and in brain drive neurotrophic factor.
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:30.500]   And then heat shock proteins are also protecting
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:31.580]   against muscle atrophy.
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:33.620]   So that's also having to do with the protein structure
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:34.740]   in the muscle tissue as well.
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:38.320]   And this has been studies in animal data,
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:40.620]   as well as some recent human data as well.
[02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:43.180]   It was local hyperthermia or local heat treatment,
[02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:45.600]   but essentially it showed that it protected.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.700]   I mean, it was like, there was a study
[02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:50.080]   where they were looking at muscle disuse
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:53.160]   and it was something like the local heat treatment
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.760]   prevented almost 40% of the muscle atrophy from disuse.
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:59.420]   And it's funny 'cause I used to use this on
[02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:00.400]   when I was injured and stuff.
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:04.320]   I would go in the sauna because I didn't know at the time
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:05.480]   'cause I was a graduate student,
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:07.680]   but I knew just from experiments
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:10.520]   that I'm not losing as much muscle.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.060]   I feel better.
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:14.200]   At the time I was reading a little about the growth hormone
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.200]   and stuff back then,
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:18.280]   and I knew about heat shock proteins.
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:21.600]   So I kind of knew, but that data wasn't around yet.
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:25.280]   And so now we have the data and I've always felt like
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:28.680]   I wasn't losing my muscle like I should have been
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:29.520]   when I was doing the sauna.
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:32.600]   And I was doing it literally seven days a week.
[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:33.600]   It was like hardcore.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.520]   - This is also during graduate school?
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:40.520]   - Yeah, now I'm doing the sauna like a bare minimum.
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:42.920]   I do three, but I try to do four because of that.
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:45.220]   It all depends on my schedule.
[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:46.660]   I also like to do long runs.
[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:49.480]   I really, it's like long being like three miles,
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:52.360]   not like Cam Haines that's too long.
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.980]   But I really, for me, and we were talking about this earlier
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:38:00.540]   like off camera that the runs for me are for my brain.
[02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:04.580]   And I get this mind wandering effect where I daydream
[02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:05.420]   and I think about things.
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:06.560]   I work through problems.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:07.400]   I get creative.
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:10.540]   I come up with ideas and this is all happening on the runs.
[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:15.120]   And so I just, I miss my runs if I don't do them
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.020]   and I miss it because of the brain effects I get from it.
[02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:22.620]   And when I exercise, it's funny because I'm a female
[02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:25.460]   and you think that I'd be exercising to stay fit
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:27.420]   and in shape and care about my figure.
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:30.360]   But when I exercise, literally what I'm thinking about
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:33.080]   is my brain and I'm like this is the best
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:34.840]   longevity drug there is.
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:36.560]   This is it right here, Rhonda.
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.080]   You're always wondering, you're always wanting to know,
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:38.900]   you're wanting to do the best.
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:40.580]   Like if you don't exercise, you're missing
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:42.200]   that essential dose.
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:45.380]   And so that for me is the motivation,
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:48.260]   the doping seeking thing I'm looking for.
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:52.340]   Admittedly, I need to, I do not do enough strength training
[02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:54.380]   and I have to do it, have to, have to, have to.
[02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:57.760]   I'm like I'm just, I'm so after the endurance and the hit
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:01.100]   and I really need to add that in because muscle mass
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:04.180]   is also extremely important for aging as well.
[02:39:04.180 --> 02:39:06.580]   So that's my fault.
[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:09.920]   - The brain effects are really interesting.
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:12.700]   I also run, I try and get one longer run per week
[02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:15.260]   and a few other runs and I do it without a phone.
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:16.580]   I don't listen to podcasts.
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:18.140]   I occasionally will listen to music,
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:19.640]   but I really try not to.
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:22.060]   I also find that my mind solves problems.
[02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:26.220]   I feel like it washes out the cobwebs, so to speak.
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:31.020]   Some of the most brilliant and prolific neuroscientists
[02:39:31.020 --> 02:39:33.420]   that I know who've had very long careers,
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:35.380]   Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize winner at Columbia
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:37.340]   comes to mind for all his work on memory,
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:39.300]   used to swim a mile a day.
[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:41.260]   And now I think swims half a mile a day,
[02:39:41.260 --> 02:39:44.580]   but he's in his late nineties and he's still sharp,
[02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:45.880]   which is incredible.
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:47.900]   And his lab has done some work showing that
[02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:50.260]   any load bearing exercise repeated,
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:52.820]   so endurance work, unlike the Peloton or cycling,
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:53.700]   that's really load bearing,
[02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:55.780]   although you're cycling really hard with the resistance,
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:40:00.780]   but causes the release of osteocalcin from the bones,
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:04.340]   which acts in an endocrine way, sort of like a hormone.
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:06.360]   Can actually travel to the hippocampus,
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:08.540]   and at least in these animal studies,
[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:11.980]   induce the proliferation of neurons, growth of synapses,
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:13.640]   BDNF, a number of downstream things,
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:15.340]   which kind of makes sense.
[02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:18.620]   If we were to put a just so evolutionary story on this,
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:21.460]   a body that's active can signal to the brain
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:23.540]   that the body still needs cognition.
[02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:27.700]   An inactive body in some ways is depriving the brain
[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:30.420]   of any signal of what the body is doing, right?
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:33.400]   This is, obviously I'm making this up as conjecture,
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:37.040]   but we know in ocean and various ocean animals
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.000]   that they'll swim around for some period of their life,
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.080]   and then they'll have a completely stationary
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:41.920]   portion of their life.
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:44.480]   And basically the brain degenerates.
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:45.820]   You don't need much of a nervous system
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:46.800]   if you're not moving.
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:48.080]   So I think there's really something there,
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:51.280]   and also just letting your ideas and mind drift.
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:52.260]   I love that you,
[02:40:52.260 --> 02:40:54.340]   and I appreciate that you shared your protocols,
[02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:57.400]   because I think right now we're in an interesting time
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.760]   in public health information history,
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:02.080]   where people are just kind of getting bombarded
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:03.720]   with cold is good, heat is gold,
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:08.560]   cold is good, heat is good, excuse me, I misspoke.
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:10.040]   There are all these micronutrients,
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:12.000]   and of course, macronutrients are important too.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.280]   And today you've really enriched us
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:18.680]   with the description of the underlying mechanisms
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:19.680]   and the logic behind them.
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:22.240]   But also sharing what you do is really informative,
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:24.840]   because I think people need a jumping off place.
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:27.680]   And obviously they need to start someplace
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:29.840]   and getting heat adapted, et cetera, it takes time.
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:31.700]   But I really appreciate that you're willing to share
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:33.240]   your protocols and that you do the things
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:36.560]   that you teach and educate people about.
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:40.100]   As a final question, because I half, half, half to ask,
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:44.560]   red light sauna or no red light sauna?
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.780]   I've been a little bit vocal about my feelings
[02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:49.020]   that none of the red light saunas I've ever been in
[02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:51.340]   got hot enough and it was frustrating.
[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:53.740]   So I feel like it's neither here nor there.
[02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:55.960]   However, I do acknowledge that red light
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:59.320]   and low level light therapies are now known
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:00.640]   to do a number of interesting things.
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:03.920]   There was a Nobel Prize in 1908 for phototherapy for lupus.
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:05.700]   So it's not like a new thing,
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:08.880]   the idea that red light and light could do things positive
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:12.320]   for our biology, but do you have a red light in your sauna?
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:13.380]   Do you think it's useful?
[02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:16.800]   And I mention this because this is the number one question
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:19.820]   I get about sauna, red light or no red light
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:22.220]   or some intermediate answer.
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:26.920]   - So I don't have an infrared sauna,
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:29.280]   but I do have, like I have a sauna that has lights.
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:30.920]   It makes red light, but I don't think it's the red light
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:33.360]   that you're talking about because it's not activating it
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:35.440]   at a specific wavelength, which is-
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:38.280]   - It's usually so that the range that seems to be helpful
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:40.840]   and I have, I confess, I use a red light panel
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:45.480]   for other things is 670 nanometer
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:49.080]   out to about 720 nanometer.
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:53.600]   So it looks like red and very dim lights,
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:55.320]   dim red and bright red.
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:57.360]   And the idea is that red light can travel,
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:59.920]   the photon and energy is such that it can travel down
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:02.840]   through the deep layers of the dermis of the skin.
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:06.220]   - I don't have a red light in my sauna.
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:09.960]   I don't know if it's essential or not.
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:12.040]   I don't think so based on all the studies I've talked about.
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.180]   I think that would be as is the potential effect
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:17.800]   on mitochondria is interesting.
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:22.020]   I do think there's a lack of really good solid evidence
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:26.300]   in humans, but that might only be because
[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:27.780]   it's just not studied enough.
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:29.120]   And that's usually the case.
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:32.320]   So perhaps, you know, like there's the Juve, right?
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:34.900]   The Juve, they have those red light panels.
[02:43:34.900 --> 02:43:38.420]   - Juve and Cozy are the two ones I know, K-O-Z and Juve.
[02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:40.300]   They're there, as far as I know,
[02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:42.360]   I'm probably gonna insult both companies at the same time,
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:44.060]   but I'd rather insult them both at the same time
[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:47.060]   than just compliment one or insult one.
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:48.620]   Both of them seem excellent
[02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:50.520]   for getting the appropriate wavelengths of red light.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:52.900]   And I do not have a relationship to either of those.
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:56.120]   - Well, I personally think that the sauna in and of itself,
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:57.480]   it's about the heat stress.
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:59.380]   And typically the question I get
[02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:02.300]   is infrared sauna or regular sauna.
[02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:04.440]   And there are some differences as well.
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:06.920]   Infrared saunas, maybe the infrared saunas
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:08.000]   are the ones that have the red light
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.160]   that you're talking about.
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:11.080]   Infrared saunas only get up to around
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:14.000]   140 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.160]   So as I mentioned, the studies were about
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:17.660]   174 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:22.660]   And so you really have to stay in a longer period of time.
[02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:26.100]   However, there have been some studies coming out of Japan.
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:29.400]   They use infrared sauna.
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:30.320]   They have this whole protocol.
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:31.940]   It's called Weigh On Therapy.
[02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:35.160]   And they get people in infrared saunas
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:36.660]   and then they wrap them in a towel
[02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:38.960]   and they stay warm for X amount.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:42.240]   So the whole protocol ends up being an hour long.
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:44.240]   But again, it's 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:45.480]   So it's an infrared sauna.
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:47.880]   And it's been shown to improve a variety
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:52.160]   of coronary heart disease and heart-related conditions.
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:53.620]   There have been some improvements.
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:56.840]   So obviously there's evidence that infrared saunas
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:59.520]   can be beneficial for cardiovascular health.
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:03.100]   I've used infrared saunas many times at my in-laws.
[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:04.120]   They have infrared sauna.
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:06.360]   And I have to crank that thing up for a while
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:07.680]   until it's maxed.
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.080]   And then I have to sit in there for an hour at least.
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:12.080]   I do sweat a lot.
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:13.620]   And that's another thing we didn't talk about.
[02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:15.580]   You do sweat some heavy metals.
[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:19.920]   And some heavy metals are excreted predominantly
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:22.320]   through sweat and others through urine.
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:26.920]   So for example, cadmium, there's like 125-fold increase
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:30.660]   in cadmium excretion from sweat when you get in the sauna.
[02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:34.760]   Also lead is something like 17-fold excretions higher.
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:36.000]   Another one is aluminum.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.220]   It's about four-fold higher.
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:39.620]   So infrared, you do sweat a lot too.
[02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:41.300]   And that's because the main difference
[02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:43.720]   is that you're heating your body up
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:47.880]   through thermal radiation versus the ambient air.
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:50.880]   Like a standard sauna is a heater
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:52.100]   and the heater's heating up the air.
[02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:54.320]   And that's how you're heating yourself up.
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:56.480]   So it is a little bit of a different mechanism.
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:45:58.520]   I prefer regular saunas.
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:01.520]   Most of the data out there is from the heat stress itself.
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:03.760]   Like your heart rate's elevating when you're in there.
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:04.600]   You're feeling hot.
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:05.660]   You're getting that cardiovascular.
[02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:06.500]   I mean, that's what you're feeling
[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:07.900]   when you're in a hot sauna.
[02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:10.320]   And that for me takes a really long time
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:13.080]   in the infrared sauna to get at the very end.
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:15.100]   But I do think there are some benefits from infrared.
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:16.560]   And they are more affordable.
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:18.160]   They're less of a fire hazard.
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:20.060]   But again, hot baths are I think
[02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:23.320]   a good alternative modality for heat stress
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:25.600]   compared to like a regular sauna.
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:27.700]   - Great, that's a really helpful answer.
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:30.200]   Like I said, I use the red light, but not in the sauna.
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:32.800]   And thank you for reminding us
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:35.720]   of that 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:38.960]   that was mainly used in all these studies.
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:40.920]   So we covered a lot of territory,
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:42.800]   but I just want to thank you again.
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:45.160]   It was extremely thorough and extremely informative.
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:48.720]   I'd now have, my notes always look a little bit
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:51.520]   like they were drawn out by a macaque monkey
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:53.160]   who has no knowledge of the English language,
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:55.300]   but I can decipher this to tell you
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:59.280]   that there are at least 10 additions
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:01.520]   to my current protocols that I'm going to add.
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.320]   And I'll have lots of questions.
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:04.940]   So I apologize in advance for that,
[02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:09.940]   but on behalf of the listeners and just directly from me,
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:11.920]   thank you so much for your time.
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:13.120]   I learned a ton.
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:13.960]   - My pleasure.
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:14.780]   Thanks for having me on.
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:16.060]   It was really awesome conversation.
[02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:17.640]   So I enjoyed it a lot.
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:18.880]   Let's do it again.
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:19.960]   - Totally.
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:20.800]   - Great.
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:21.640]   Thank you for joining me

[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:44.560]   that match the peer-reviewed science
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:46.720]   and recommendations made on various episodes

[02:48:54.580 --> 02:48:56.740]   And you will also find behavioral tools

[02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:13.920]   There, I teach science and science-based tools,
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:15.820]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:17.380]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:49:17.380 --> 02:49:18.900]   but much of which is distinct
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:21.260]   from the content of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:49:21.260 --> 02:49:22.580]   Thank you once again for joining me
