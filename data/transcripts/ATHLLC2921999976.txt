[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.880]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.160]   about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.760]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you here.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.640]   Now, it probably won't surprise you to learn that one of the
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.480]   reasons I started a podcast is that I really enjoy listening to
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.640]   podcasts myself, and while I follow a lot of them, there's
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.240]   only a few I listen to every week.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.440]   One of those is a podcast called Animal Spirits, which as they
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.880]   say, is a show about markets, life, and investing.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.600]   And today, I'm chatting with one of the hosts of that show, Ben Carlson.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.040]   Ben is a financial advisor and the Director of Institutional Asset
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.160]   Management at Ritholtz Wealth Management.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.400]   He's also the author of four books about saving, investing, and money,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.080]   the first of which shares a name with the blog he's been writing
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.720]   since 2013, A Wealth of Common Sense.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.080]   Ben's one of my go-tos for questions about investing and personal
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.920]   finance, and I'm excited to have him here to chat about markets
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.000]   in 2022, inflation, interest rates, recessions, alternative
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.400]   assets, stock investing, and his favorite ways to hack and
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.560]   simplify your finances and investments.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   That is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.640]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.280]   own opinions and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.720]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.480]   relied upon for investment decisions.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.280]   Ben, thanks for being here.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.320]   Hey, Chris.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.840]   Nice to be here.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.080]   So I'm just going to kick off.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.920]   I listened to your podcast this morning and you said, "I'm done
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.840]   picking stocks."
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.160]   What changed?
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.240]   My returns, maybe?
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600]   I've had a love-hate relationship with picking stocks.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.720]   I've, for some reason, I've always been a simple like index fund,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.440]   target fund investor for the most part.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.080]   Like my very first purchase in the stock market was a target date fund.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.880]   My dad helped me set up an IRA right out of college, and I've
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.960]   just dabbled here and there.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   And I go on and off.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.600]   I go on these streaks.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000]   Then in 2020, when things were just getting crushed, I thought, "Why
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.200]   not wade back into it?"
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.160]   It was really fun.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.760]   I had a Robinhood account.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.040]   I bought a bunch of stocks.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.080]   Everyone's stocks were going up that year.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.720]   And I'm buying the things most people are, right?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.760]   I have a little crypto.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.440]   I have some growth stocks.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.800]   And that was really fun.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.760]   And things are going high.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.640]   And then I have this other part of my portfolio that's just working on
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.920]   automatic and it's boring and all this other stuff.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   So it was a way to scratch an itch.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   And then 2021 and 2022 happened and all these growth stocks that I bought
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.160]   because it was fun are getting killed.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.880]   And it's just a good reminder of just how hard it is.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.320]   Because I talked on our show today.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.840]   I had this thesis and I've been thinking for a while.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.000]   I think I said in 2017, "Eventually, millennials are going to grow up like
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.920]   everyone else and they're going to buy houses.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.800]   And we're not building enough houses right now.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.200]   So I think housing is going to be strong."
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.920]   And I didn't think it was going to be nearly as strong as it is.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   But I've had this thesis and I see last year, Zillow was down 50%.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.520]   And I think, "Geez, this is a company that was just on SNL.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.960]   It's really popular.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's the biggest brand name in the United States as far as housing goes.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.400]   Everyone likes to play around on Zillow.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.200]   Why don't I pick up some shares on the cheap?"
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.920]   And then from those 50% down levels, it's on another 50%.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.160]   And I guess maybe it's a good reminder to me that just how hard it is to pick stocks.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.600]   And that's why I'm just kind of like, "You know what?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.280]   I know some people find a lot of joy in it and entertainment.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.720]   And some people are very good at it."
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.440]   For me, there's just so many first, second, third, fourth level thinking
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.480]   that you have to do to get it right.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.600]   So even if you're right on the macro stuff, you could be completely wrong
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.480]   about a company or a company can just not fulfill its promises and expectations.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.160]   And it's just easier for me to do a lot of other stuff than pick stocks.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   I have had similar bets.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.960]   The bet I regretted for all of 2021 was, or maybe it was even 2020, was, "Gosh,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.080]   I didn't buy Peloton.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.320]   I love my Peloton.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.840]   I should have bought it.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.440]   I watch it rise and rise and rise."
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.200]   And then it was just down and down and down.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.480]   So fortunately, I never bought it and I didn't lose as much as I probably could
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.680]   have, but every time it was down, I thought it was another time to buy
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.800]   and it just kept going down.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.360]   And for every one of those that you kick yourself for, "Oh, this was so obvious.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   Why didn't I see it?"
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200]   There's 10 other examples of ones that you probably would have
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.400]   bought and just did terrible.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.160]   And I think the market especially has just shown, these last four or five
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.280]   years, how difficult it really is to beat.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   And maybe some people don't do it with their eye on, "Well, I'm
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.320]   going to outperform the market.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.640]   I'm going to have this alpha."
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.880]   And that wasn't my thing either.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.040]   I have this, what I call a fun portfolio.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.880]   It's 5% or 10% of my investable assets.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.520]   And I do it just to follow some stocks and trends that I think are interesting.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.440]   But even that, I think there's enough ways to scratch an itch if you have, that you
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.880]   want to have an entertaining portion of your portfolio, there's other ways to do
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.800]   it these days where for me, it doesn't involve stock picking and I already have
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.120]   these other investments in the stock market using low cost index funds
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.720]   that can get the job done anyway.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   So what are those things?
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.680]   If you're not going to scratch the itch with stocks, I agree.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.040]   Most of my assets are in long-term diverse portfolio of index funds and it's boring.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.080]   The best I get is a push notification.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.800]   That's like, "Oh, we did some tax loss harvesting."
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.560]   I'm like, "Oh, cool."
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.800]   But that's kind of it.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.040]   How do you scratch the itch now?
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.480]   So I'm probably going to leave my Robinhood portfolio.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.040]   So I own some crypto.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.120]   I've dabbled in art from a place like Masterworks and Fundrise allows you to
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.600]   invest in real estate, direct real estate on a private basis.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.320]   I've started getting into startups in the last 12 months, which sounds
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.640]   like everyone is doing, so it's not like any of these things I'm getting
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.040]   into are unique by any means.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.480]   So I have some of this other stuff that I'm doing and I get to
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.240]   talk about it all the time.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.120]   You mentioned my podcast.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   I talk about this stuff on a weekly basis.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.360]   And for me, that's almost as fun as investing in it.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.640]   It's just talking about it.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.480]   And so I just don't think I need it anymore.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.240]   And I think there's a lot of time and effort you have to put into this
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   stuff if you're really going to be good at it, because it seemed like in
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.520]   2020, you could just buy a stock that you knew, a company that you knew,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.960]   or a brand that you liked, and that was easy enough.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   But you have people out there who are really putting in the work and they
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.600]   have a hard time beating the stock market.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.760]   They have these PhDs and quants and people who went to Ivy League schools
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.480]   that just are really, really smart and they have a hard time outperforming
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.880]   the market. So I think for me, I'll probably eat these words someday and
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.040]   come back to it, I'm sure.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.760]   But for now, I have enough other stuff going on in my life.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.520]   It's almost like I hear people talk about fantasy football and they're
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.840]   always like, "Why do I do this?
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.760]   All it is is pain and time consuming and I never get anything out of it.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.160]   And if I win, who cares?
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.040]   And if I lose, I just feel like a jerk and it's not that fun."
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.160]   So to me, it's kind of like that, where it's like the risk/reward is
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.520]   not tilted in my favor.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.880]   And it's like, "Why even do it then?"
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.080]   It's funny, with fantasy football, it was one of those things where I
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   would get so into it.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.640]   And the prize at the end of the day for our league was like $500.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.840]   And I was like, "Man, the hours I've spent."
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.560]   And finally, I think I do miss that kind of fun aspect of the banter
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.680]   around it. And I wish I could bring that back.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.160]   But for me, it was just hard to play it casually.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.080]   So when I started a company, I was like, "I'm out.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.360]   I don't have the time for this.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.080]   If I do it, it's going to occupy so much headspace."
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.360]   But one of the things you said that's interesting is about some of these
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.840]   alternatives, a thing that I take away from all of this access is that a lot
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.720]   of these new alternatives, whether it's wine or art or real estate, there's
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.560]   still like long-term portfolio-driven bets, whereas stocks often feel like
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.200]   kind of a short-term single bet.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.800]   And so you get this marriage of the excitement, but something a little more
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.840]   similar to a long-term strategy, which I think has made me more interested in that.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.440]   So instead of picking stocks in the last 2 years, I've gone in, I've picked
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.960]   some art, or I've picked some startups or stuff like that, just with a small
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.000]   piece of the portfolio, but still making portfolio bets, which I think, in my
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.120]   opinion, is a little bit less risk and more diversified, but of things that are
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.320]   more exciting than just the entire market.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.080]   And I think at this stage of my life where I've been doing this for a while
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.560]   now, I don't need to see those marks every day to make me fulfilled and see
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.760]   that the scoreboard and I'm winning or losing sports gambling online is legal
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.120]   now in Michigan. So I've been doing that for the last year, just very little
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.800]   amounts, and it's just kind of entertaining.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.840]   And at least that's the kind of thing where you either win or lose after the
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.560]   outcome. You don't have to wait and see.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.600]   Like in the stock market, if you pick up that stock, you can get killed every
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.280]   day. That scoreboard is just staring you in the face every day.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.000]   So I like having this stuff that maybe is not quite as liquid, but you also don't
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.960]   see the fluctuations every day.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.240]   And that's why owning a house is often the best financial asset for so many
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.080]   people, even though if you compare the returns of the stock market over time,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.400]   maybe it's not the greatest investment in the world, but because it's like a
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.760]   forced savings vehicle and you're forced to hold it, and every day someone's not
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.480]   coming to you and saying, "This is the value now.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.400]   No, this is the value now." It makes you a longer term investor.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.160]   And that stuff has been way more helpful to me, just having a long term mindset.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.760]   And I think looking at individual stocks every day and how they move by five or
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.360]   10% is not really helpful.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.800]   I think Andy Ratcliffe, the founder of Wealthfront, came on the podcast and
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.640]   said, "Look, if having a small amount of money in something exciting is what
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.400]   lets you leave a huge amount of money or the vast majority of your portfolio in
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.680]   something tried and true, like a diverse, passive set of index funds, then great.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.320]   It's the price you're going to pay for the 95% of your portfolio being in the
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.120]   thing you really want. It's probably better.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.400]   But at the end of the day, it's unlikely that you will consistently outperform
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.600]   because people that do this for a living are not consistently outperforming."
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.440]   And we tell this to our clients too.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.760]   It's good to have that behavioral risk valve for that part to say, "I'm actually
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.160]   doing something. I feel like my hands are on the steering wheel and this other
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.960]   stuff that's more automated and rules based and boring and taken care of, this
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.720]   allows me to do something."
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.160]   And I also think it's a good comparison because you can say, "This really is
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.520]   hard." And doing it on a consistent basis, I can see that just having a smaller
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.520]   piece of my portfolio, I'm not going to wreck everything.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.920]   So I think there's something to that.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.720]   A question I have.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   So stocks used to be the fun thing, but they're actually a component of most
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.360]   people's long term passive portfolio as well.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.880]   A lot of these new alternatives, I'm curious, you've thought about this both
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.800]   from an institutional standpoint and with clients at the firm.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.560]   How do you think about some of these alternatives fitting into that longer
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.920]   term portfolio as well, whether that's crypto or real estate or art or wine or
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.640]   things like that?
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.200]   They can be fun, but are they also a part of a long term diverse strategy?
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.440]   Here's how I've dealt with it personally, is I want the rest of my financial
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.680]   house in order before I ever even talk about alternatives.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.040]   So I'm maxing out my 401(k), I have a SEP IRA that I'm putting money into, my
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.920]   kid's 529, I have that emergency fund, all that stuff.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   So all of that boring stuff is taken care of.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.200]   And then after that's taken care of, then I move on to alternatives.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.840]   Right now, obviously, maybe not everyone gets to that point where they're maxing
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.240]   everything out, depending on their means or whatever their income.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.280]   But I think that's the idea is make sure you have everything else shored up
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.880]   first, and then figure out how this stuff can fit within your portfolio.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.840]   And I know a lot of these platforms, they were democratizing investing, we're
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.480]   making it easy, and they have low minimums and all this stuff.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.840]   And it's great to have access to this stuff.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.120]   But I think that you have to have these other building blocks in place before you
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.240]   ever even consider some of this stuff, especially if you really don't know what
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.080]   you're doing and don't understand how some of this stuff works.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.440]   And would you put things like crypto in that bucket as well?
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.000]   Probably.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   I know a lot of young people probably think it would be nuts to say that because
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.760]   they want to put a lot of their assets in that.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.520]   But I do think it makes sense to have that stuff, especially since it's so
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.440]   speculative and moves around so much and so volatile.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.600]   Having some of these things in your life that aren't going to move as much and
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   just be the building blocks that you don't have to worry as much about and then
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.320]   have fun.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.160]   Again, for me, it's 5% or 10% of the portfolio for my fun brokerage account or
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.660]   whatever.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.840]   But for other people, that may be a different number.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.080]   So I think you have to figure out what you're comfortable with.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.440]   But I think you have to have some sort of level or ceiling on these things.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.280]   So it doesn't totally get out of control.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.440]   And either when it goes down, you're going to be in the pits of despair and
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.840]   try to freak out and "What am I going to do?"
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.080]   Or if it gets too high, then you go, "Well, now what do I do?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.440]   It's 50% of my portfolio."
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.400]   If you don't have some sort of line in the sand or reasoning ahead of time,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.800]   it's going to be hard to figure out what to do with it when it gets to either too
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.760]   low or too high.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.520]   That's where I think software that can take care of that is helpful.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.720]   Obviously, I work at Wealthfront.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.200]   I love that if something goes too high, I don't have to think about it.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.160]   Because man, I was in that situation with crypto.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.360]   It's a higher percentage of my portfolio than I want.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.280]   And now I'm like, "But I don't want to sell it."
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.640]   Even though I know I should.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.520]   It's like coming to that conviction is really hard.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.280]   Any advice to people who have ideas of what they want to do,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.520]   but struggle to actually put them into place?
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.400]   Unfortunately, that's why you have to have some of these things in advance.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.000]   I use this example in my book.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.800]   They actually did a study of prison inmates.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.520]   And they found surprisingly, even though they don't have as much access to food,
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.320]   and they get all this time probably to work out if they want to,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.440]   from the movies and TV shows.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   You think, "Oh, everyone at prison is just getting ripped and working out all the time."
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.800]   They actually found these 100 inmates they studied,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.560]   90% of them actually gained weight being in prison.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   And they tried to figure out, "Well, why is this?"
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.240]   And what they found was they were those big jumpsuits.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.440]   And there's no belt or anything around the waist.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.240]   And they had nothing to restrict them and let them know
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.400]   or give them some sort of like, "What's happening to my body?"
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.280]   They had no idea.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.640]   So some of these people were surprised.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.960]   "I can't believe I gained 15 pounds in prison.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.200]   I thought this was going to be a chance for me to work out and lose weight."
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.680]   And it's because they had no restrictor there
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.160]   to let them know that things were getting out of control.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.120]   So I think you have to go into these investments thinking...
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.480]   So let's say you bought Bitcoin back in the day and you said,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.880]   "Okay, I have two options. I can let this be a buy and hold forever.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.920]   And whatever percentage of my portfolio goes to, that's what it's going to be.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.640]   I'm just going to let it run and it's going to be its own little bucket."
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.560]   Or you could say, "Alright, I'm going to do the portfolio management thing here.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.360]   And every time it gets to 10% of my portfolio, I'm trimming.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   And every time it gets to 5%, I'm adding."
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.040]   And so I think you have to go into it with that.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.600]   Because if you try to do it after the fact, if it's grown to 15% or 20% or 30%,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.120]   at that point, you're going, "I don't know what to do.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.520]   Because what if it keeps growing and getting bigger?
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.160]   And what if I sell now and I feel like an idiot?"
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.400]   Because the whole process of investing is this premise of regret minimization.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.200]   What would I regret more?
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.320]   It goes to 50% but I sold early,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.480]   or it falls and it goes back to 5% of my portfolio and I never sold anything.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.000]   Which one would be more painful to you?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.320]   And some people, it's personality driven.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.120]   For some people, it really...
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   Who knows?
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.600]   It depends what affects you more.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.720]   So for you, what would it be?
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.560]   Would you be more worried if all your crypto crashed 90% and now it's so small and you go,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.920]   "Oh man, I never rebalanced once."
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.600]   Or if it kept going up and you sold a little and actually locked in some gains?
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.400]   For me, it's funny.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.920]   It's living in Silicon Valley.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   I think so many people are participating in this new asset class that if everyone...
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.320]   For me, if everyone else sees it, it goes to the moon, as we say.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.160]   And I was just on the sidelines, I would feel bad.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.760]   So for me, I put a small amount of my portfolio in this.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.960]   Yes, it's grown a lot.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.920]   I'm holding it.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.200]   I keep saying forever.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.600]   But I'm in the buy and hold camp for what I did.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.240]   And yes, it's a higher percentage of the portfolio.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.960]   But when it went in, it was just almost an insignificant amount.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.440]   And to be honest, I'm with you.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.760]   I bought a very small amount in 2017.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.720]   Because like you, I wasn't a true believer in crypto.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.640]   But I said, "I can see what's coming.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.880]   And I've studied human nature and behavior.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.000]   And if this thing gets so big, and all these tech people are saying this stuff,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.640]   and I miss out, I'm going to kick myself."
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.600]   So I put some money in.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.800]   And I said at the time, "I'm buying and holding this forever."
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.120]   Whatever forever could change, I guess, someday.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.720]   But basically, I'm not going to trim it.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.600]   I'm not going to...
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.960]   I'm going to let this thing go.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.400]   And it's going to be its own entity.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.160]   But then the rest of my portfolio, I have these bands around allocations and weights
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.120]   and rebalancing all this stuff.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.560]   But I think you have to have that discussion with yourself ahead of time.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.720]   Because if you're doing it after the fact,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.200]   your judgment is going to be so clouded by whatever the price is.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.800]   Yeah, I think that's the...
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.080]   My big takeaway is whatever your plan is,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.880]   just come up with an idea of what you want to do when you put it in place.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.000]   If you put a portfolio in and say, "I want to rebalance this."
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.280]   Say, "Here's what I'm going to do it."
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.800]   Because it's way harder to make those decisions after the fact.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.000]   I always tell people like even a bad plan is better than no plan at all.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.320]   Because at least a bad plan has some sort of guidelines
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.720]   and gives you some sense of what to do.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.400]   If you're just like winging it,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.720]   which I know a lot of people are when they first get started.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.840]   And that makes it 10 times scarier when something goes down.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.520]   Because if you don't have a plan for planning in advance that
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.840]   my stocks or my crypto or whatever is going to get killed,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.280]   if you're just hoping it's not going to,
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.320]   eventually, you're going to be wrong.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.680]   It's not going to work out for you.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.080]   I know you spent a lot of time on the institutional side.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.120]   And institutional funds, especially things like endowments,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.960]   they're kind of like the golden example of how to invest.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.440]   Are there lessons that you've taken away from how institutions invest
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.000]   that would be great for people to adopt?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.760]   Or maybe some that shouldn't even apply that would be helpful to hear?
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   I like to look at the difference between institutions and individuals
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.360]   from the lens of mistakes.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   And so most individual mistakes come from
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.920]   being naive and not understanding enough before they invest in something again,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.120]   and not having a plan.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.760]   You can't say that about institutional investors like endowments and foundations
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.320]   I've worked with. They have boards and committees.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.120]   And they have everything documented.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.280]   And they pretty much have all that stuff in place.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.720]   They have these plans.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.040]   The problem is, is that they're all so smart
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.280]   that they get overconfident in their abilities.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.080]   And they think that they're just going to outthink and outsmart everyone.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.280]   And so it's like different ends of the mistake curve or whatever,
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.480]   where the really smart people who have all this money,
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.640]   just assume that because they're so intelligent,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.680]   they have so many resources that outperforming should be easy for them.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.920]   And then the other end, you have the naive individuals
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.000]   who haven't thought through this stuff and don't know how hard it is yet,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.520]   because they haven't experienced it or paid the market gods their tuition.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.240]   They don't understand that, "Oh, yeah, wait, this is really hard to do."
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   So that's the way that I look at it.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.960]   As far as learning for institutions, I always tell people,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560]   it's just a few more zeros that they have.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.280]   I've worked with a billion dollar foundations before.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.880]   And I don't think that you can really throw out the basic building blocks of
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.720]   having some sort of investment policy in place and having an asset allocation.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.760]   And I know this stuff is so boring to most people.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.720]   But that's the thing where the difference between managing
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.920]   a billion dollars for an endowment and a million dollars for
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.320]   a family is just a few zeros as far as investment policy goes.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.520]   They still have to pay attention to the risk profile and time horizon
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.080]   and understand an asset allocation that suits their needs
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.000]   and their ability to take risk and all this stuff.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.960]   So it seems like there should be this one path for these institutions
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.800]   because they're so big and they have so many resources.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.160]   And then something else for the little guy.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.760]   But I don't think it has to be that way.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.800]   And that's honestly one of the reasons that I was banging
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.280]   my head against the wall when I worked in that field.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.400]   Because I wanted those big institutions to simplify the way that they invested.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.920]   And a lot of them wanted to make it way more complex than I thought it had to be.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.280]   So I want to ask a question on asset allocation.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.840]   If someone's listening and that's an unfamiliar term,
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   and they're sitting here like, "Whoa, what's going on? I bought a few stocks.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.280]   I haven't even thought about that."
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.600]   Is there a place you'd point them to get started?
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.160]   I know we could do a whole episode just on asset allocation.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.520]   So maybe that's in the future.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.320]   But where would you point someone to get started thinking about
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.440]   their risk profile and the portfolio they should build?
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.760]   I think thinking through what's happened
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.680]   just in the last couple decades of the stock market is probably not a bad place to be.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.400]   So let's say in 2008, the stock market fell 50%, maybe 55% in the US stock market.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.920]   Some other stock markets fell more.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.800]   If you have all your money in stocks, that's something you should plan on happening
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.600]   at least a few times throughout your lifetime, depending on your age, right?
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.040]   That you'll probably see your portfolio get cut in half if you have all your money in stocks.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.760]   And then think about bonds right now, basically, because yields are so low, like cash, right?
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.400]   If you have your money in cash, it's not going to earn much for you.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.160]   But it's also not going to go down in value.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.000]   Nominally, the stock market can.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.400]   We can talk about inflation, all that stuff that eats into cash.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.040]   So obviously, the levers here are hold more cash or less cash.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   And that's going to decrease your volatility and losses,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.800]   but potentially decrease your returns.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.680]   And for most young people, a lot of people who think just like,
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.080]   type A personality, like everyone should be rational.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.120]   You have to have all your money in stocks because you have all this time ahead of you.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.560]   You're going to be saving more.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.200]   You have this human capital as the wind behind your sails.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.760]   And put all your money in stocks because you can handle it.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.120]   But some people, because of their personality, their emotional makeup, they can't.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.080]   They really just can't.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.440]   They couldn't withstand a 50% crash in the stock market without selling and
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.560]   tapping out and saying "Uncle."
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.440]   And so I think a lot of it has to do with your personality.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.000]   But that's the idea is how much more safe liquid stuff do you need
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.640]   that will allow you to leave the stock market investments alone?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.240]   And so is that 10% in cash and bonds or 20% whatever it is, whatever that lever is,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.280]   some people can handle the volatility and other people just can't.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.560]   And the worst thing to do is make a mistake at the worst possible time
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.800]   and sell out of your stocks when they're already down.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.320]   That's the worst thing.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.960]   So yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with your personality.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.120]   But yeah, that whole asset allocation thing.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.800]   There's no perfect number for anyone.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.400]   You can't just say like, "Oh, this is for you. It's $95,500."
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.280]   It's unfortunately... There's no such thing as a perfect portfolio.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.440]   It's only known in hindsight.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.240]   But people have to get something that they can be comfortable with.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.480]   Because if you have this perfect, optimized portfolio,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.840]   great. But you can't stick with it. It's effectively useless.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.000]   Is there a book or a blog post of yours or someone else's that you'd say is a good
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.640]   starting point for thinking about this?
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   So Wealth of Common Sense, my first book you mentioned.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.480]   I have a whole chapter in there about asset allocation and diversification and rebalancing
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.440]   that goes through some examples between a 50/50 stock bond portfolio or 100/0
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   and all those things. So I have a whole chapter on that, I think, in that one.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.800]   And if all of this is crazy, and you're like, "I just want something simple."
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.320]   There's 2 things. There's target date funds, which is like just pick a fund.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:20.000]   And there's usually a year associated with it that affects the portfolio and changes over time.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.080]   Or I'd be mistaken to not mention that I work for a company that offers a very simple robo
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.000]   portfolio that you can just put money in and take a risk quiz and it'll rebalance for you.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.120]   So those are the simple options. And I know there's a lot of people who say like,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.200]   "We'll try to find issues with taking those risk questions or a target date fund."
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.400]   But to that, I say, "What's the alternative?" I think these robo advisors and target date funds
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.720]   are some of the best leaps forward we've had for individual investors in a long, long time.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.440]   It started with index funds, and then we get to these things now that are a whole
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.280]   portfolio in one for you, just through the click of a button, basically.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.440]   And I think it's fantastic for the vast majority of investors,
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   especially if you're just starting out and don't know what to do.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.760]   One question. You work at an RIA or a firm for financial advisors. Is there something you would
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.520]   tell a friend that said, "Should I be working with a financial advisor? When does that matter?
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.400]   Who is that important for?" I hear a lot of people that fall into money and they're like,
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.640]   "Well, now that I have a million dollars, now it's time to work with a financial advisor."
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.800]   I'm curious what your perspective is on that.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.920]   I think a lot of people who optimize their lives and they listen to your podcast and look
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.320]   for these hacks, a lot of them will probably say, "I'm a DIY person. I will never need an advisor.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.040]   I can do it myself." And honestly, there's a lot of people who do put in the work and don't really
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.120]   need an advisor. They can probably find the right resources on their own if they look hard enough,
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.600]   and they can handle it. But the people that come to us do so for a number of reasons.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.840]   One of them is just that they are busy and they have other stuff going on in their lives,
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.680]   and they don't care about this stuff as much as you and I do.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.920]   You and I obsess over this stuff, and we read about it, and we follow it and listen to podcasts,
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.320]   and we do our own podcasts. And that's great. But some people just don't have the time or
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.400]   the inclination to do all the stuff, all the work that we've put into this because we actually like
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.360]   this. Other people would say like, "What is wrong with you, dorks? Why do you care
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.120]   about this stuff so much?" But we love it. Some people don't. They just want to outsource.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.680]   And they do this with other areas of their lives too, where they're outsourced to
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.600]   tax providers or lawyers or whatever. And so that's probably a big one.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.880]   The other one is just when you have a big life event. So for a lot of people recently,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.840]   that's retirement, right? We've got a lot of people come to us and say, "I've been doing
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.360]   this myself for 30 years. I've saved. I've got this whole retirement nut here. But I'm nervous
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.800]   I'm going to mess it up. And I don't want that to happen. And I want someone else to take the
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.480]   steering wheel and help me make better decisions." A lot of people are worried about, "Hey, I've been
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.240]   managing money myself forever. What about my kids or my spouse that doesn't pay attention as much
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   as me? I want someone else there to help make decisions if I get hit by a bus or something."
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.480]   So I think those are a few. I think a lot of times when your financial life does get complex,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.960]   like for me, a simple one. From the time I had my first job at 15, my dad,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.800]   who is a financial nerd himself, taught me to do my own taxes. And he thought that I could learn
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.440]   something by doing that. And I thought it was great. And I've done my own taxes for 20 plus
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   years until about 2 years ago, when my life got more complex. And we have a tax team on staff.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   And I handed it over to them because my life got more complex because I became a shareholder in
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.240]   the firm. And I had all these weird K1 things going on. And it was just... It became way too
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.680]   complex for me to handle. And even though my dad wanted to help me through it, I'm like, "Dad,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.840]   all right. It's enough. I'm handing it over." And so some people just have that happen,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.600]   where they have an inheritance or an estate planning issue or something in their tax life.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.080]   I know a lot of times people think you hand over your money to an advisor because they're
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.200]   going to help you manage your portfolio. Portfolio management is one piece of it.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.480]   But there's so much else that goes into it from taxes and estate planning,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.080]   to passing your money along and making good decisions. So I think that's a big one too.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   It's just your life has become a little too complex,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.040]   your financial life, that you need someone else to just take over for you.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.600]   And I'll point out that for anyone listening, there are financial planners out there
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.320]   that help people go through a lot of these decisions that aren't investment managers.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   It's not all or nothing. There are people... I'll link to a couple places where you can find them
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.960]   in the show notes. But there are people that you can say, "Hey, I'm going to pay a fee."
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.200]   Kind of like you pay a tax advisor each year and say, "I want to run through everything.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.800]   I want to figure out what I'm doing wrong. What am I doing right? Where should I be thinking
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.440]   differently?" And then you can keep managing your investments.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.840]   So I think there are multiple options here. And it's not all or nothing. It's not,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.640]   "I have to give up every piece of control." And that's great is that because of the internet,
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.360]   that it's wide open. In the past, you would have had to go to your local person
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.000]   down the street. And that was the only option. There's so many options for people to get help.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.400]   And even at some of the big financial institutions now, they'll have a call center of financial
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.160]   planners there that you can call and talk to. And like you said, an hourly planner,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.280]   pretty much anything you want now you can get if you look hard enough.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:49.760]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it. Life comes at you
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.400]   fast. But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.320]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.440]   and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.640]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.040]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.400]   celebrate that you got through another week. With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.200]   drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.480]   without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.200]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So when I really wanted
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.760]   to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:45.360]   Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.

[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:17.440]   you use our link, you're supporting our show, Notion.com/allthehacks. I want to come back to a
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.480]   few things that you mentioned, because there's a lot that can come from that. One is, you talked
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.240]   about retirement accounts, and it's important to put money in retirement accounts first before you
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.880]   think about alternatives. And I just want to tap on... There's a different perspective I've heard
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.440]   recently, which is as you're young, liquidity is really important. You put money in retirement
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.000]   accounts, you can't use it for a down payment. You can't use it to do anything other than save
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.600]   for retirement without paying fees. Do you still think that the right guidance is always max out
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.200]   all retirement accounts? Or is there a perspective that might be different for younger people where
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.840]   liquidity is more important and things like a down payment cost a lot of money and a lot more
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.800]   than it did years ago? Yeah, I've heard some of this too. My colleague, Nick Majulia, writes this
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   blog of dollars and data. And he said, "Maxing your 401(k) is ridiculous when you're young."
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.560]   Because he compared, "What if you did an index fund portfolio in your brokerage account,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.280]   compared to the 401(k) and that tax deferral benefit?" And he ran the numbers. And it's not
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.960]   as much as you would think. That tax deferral, how much it really helps, especially if you're
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.320]   someone who is not making a lot of moves in your portfolio. I do think that there's something to
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.240]   the constraint of having it in a retirement account and knowing that you have to pay a penalty if you
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.640]   take it out, in most cases, that it helps you think and act long term. Like when I put money
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.600]   in my 401(k), it's just totally out of sight, out of mind to me. And I know I'm not going to touch
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:41.200]   it for decades. And that helps me plan around my other stuff. So if I need liquidity, I plan
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.680]   around it. I do think that a Roth IRA is probably your best option for this kind of stuff because
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.400]   you can take out your contributions, tax and penalty-free. You can't take out any investment
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.760]   gains you make. But those contributions make sense. I really wish that they would just
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.360]   increase the limit on that to your 401(k) for people who don't have a 401(k) or a 401(b) at
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.080]   their job. That makes sense to me. But I can get behind that. And I've had a lot of people
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.920]   in recent years ask, "Do you think it makes sense to cut back on my 401(k) to save for these other
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.400]   things? A wedding, a down payment, I have kids on the way." And yeah, if you have the foresight to
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.520]   save for those things and you're cutting back on your 401(k) a little bit, the simplest advice is
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.840]   always get the match because you're turning down free money that way.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.240]   But then if you have other things you're saving for, sure, especially with housing prices so much
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   higher than they were, and the down payment may be having to be so much higher. Yeah, sure. I
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.680]   think it does make sense, especially if that's a much bigger priority than retiring in 4 decades
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.160]   or whatever. I think the 2 big things. If there's a match, I'm always an advocate of putting in
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.280]   whatever you need to get the match. And then also take a look. I've looked at some 401(k)s that are
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.920]   just really expensive. The funds that they force you to go in... I'll link in the show notes.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.720]   Maybe you know the site. There's a site where you can put in your employer and they'll tell
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.960]   you how bad the fees are in your 401(k). And there are some places where it might actually
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.440]   be a worse decision financially. If your 401(k) is at Vanguard, it's probably not that bad.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.800]   But there are a handful of companies where it's expensive. So that's the only other
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   other big thing that I think about. But I love it as a forced savings vehicle.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.680]   If you have the discipline to force yourself to save and not touch your money,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.560]   then let yourself decide. But definitely get the free match and look out for fees.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   Yeah. I do think that one of the things that's the greatest about having a 401(k) if you have it
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   is just that that money comes out before you even see your paycheck at your bank account.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.400]   And you don't even think about the lost money that you have saving there.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.320]   I know it's only one extra step if you got paid and then you transferred it somewhere. But
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.440]   just taking that step away for people like that, putting that barrier in place,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.160]   I think is really helpful to a lot of people. So they don't even think
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.480]   of that loss aversion of "Oh no, that $500 is gone forever now because I
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.200]   had to save it." It's out of sight, out of mind.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.560]   One thing... It's kind of a hack, I guess. If people don't know this,
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.720]   a lot of payroll providers will let you split your direct deposit.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.560]   And so let's say you're saving for a down payment and you want that same benefit,
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.960]   you can go in, open up a savings account somewhere else, and take the routing number
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.200]   and the account number and go to log into ADP's website or whatever your payroll provider is.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.360]   And you can usually go add it. And you can say, "I'm going to add this to my account
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.040]   and sweep $100 each paycheck so I don't have to see it."
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.800]   So there is the ability to automate that with most payroll providers
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.560]   if you want that same feeling.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.440]   My wife did this... Our twins are 4 years old now. When they were like 1 years old,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.360]   she's like, "Alright, when they turn 4 or 5, I want to bring them to Disney."
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.560]   And so she turned it on. She did $50 a month from her paycheck. And this is gonna be my Disney fund.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.080]   She's like, "I'm gonna save for like 3 years. And we're actually going to Disney next week."
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.920]   And she saved for 3 years for this. And 3 years later, $50 a month
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.240]   is paying for the majority of the trip. And just because she did it in little drips and grabs
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.480]   and thought of it ahead of time. But yeah, that just went to a straight
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.360]   online savings account. Nothing fancy.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.560]   So we talked about investing in the long term. And we've been dabbling a little bit.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.880]   And okay, well, if it's for 3 years, online savings account. If it's a down payment...
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.280]   I know a question that you get on the podcast all the time. And a question I get is,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.920]   "What do you do with that short term money?" It used to be 2-3 years ago, it was like,
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.800]   "Well, high yield savings accounts are paying 2+%. There's a lot of good options."
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.720]   With interest rates so low, the average savings account right now is probably paying
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.440]   point something percent. It's probably low single digits percent depending on where it is.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.960]   Is there a good option that isn't as risky as the stock market? Is it really like a
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.440]   2080 portfolio of stocks and bonds? Is it high yield crypto accounts?
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.440]   What do you think is a good place to put money that you don't need for 4 or 5 years?
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.000]   I wish I had a good answer for this. In the low interest rate world... And it's
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.520]   possible we might be in a low interest rate world for a long, long time too.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.280]   So I think this is something people might have to get used to. I think my Marcus online
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.760]   savings account pays 50 basis points. Half a percent. I think the first question you have
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.600]   to ask yourself is, "If I'm going to stretch for yield in some way, whether that's investing in
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.920]   stocks, investing in a diversified portfolio..." By the way, I got an email from someone last week
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   saying, "I put the entire down payment of my house into growth stocks. And not just like Apple and
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:10.560]   Amazon, but hyper growth stocks." And they were like, "In 2020, I was a genius. And now, I don't
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:17.520]   know what I'm going to do." And so that's the downside here. I think especially... That's the
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.480]   extreme, of course. But think about... Let's say you have $10,000. For every $10,000 you have,
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.960]   every extra 1% is $100 a year. Now, $100 can be a lot of money for some people. But I think
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:32.000]   you have to think through, "How much do I have in savings? And how much is reaching for yield
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.920]   and putting that extra risk on going to actually matter? Is it going to make a difference in the
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.200]   down payment two or three years down the line? Or should I just play it safe and not worry about it?"
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.480]   I'm a play it safe kind of guy. I know that there are people who have especially the stablecoin
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.560]   stuff at places like BlockFi and Gemini. And we've had the BlockFi CEO, Zach Prince, on our podcast
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.840]   a number of times. And the way he says it is, "Listen, if I'm having this emergency fund that's
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.920]   actually for emergencies, I'm probably not going to put it in this stuff. Because it is... You're
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.120]   not earning 7% or 8% for nothing. There is some risk involved there. And this is still a really
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.760]   new product. I personally have some money in there. But again, that's not an emergency fund."
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.160]   And he said, "Listen, if you're saving for a boat, sure. I'd feel pretty comfortable putting
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.760]   in there because it's not going to be the end of the world if something happens to it. But if it
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.000]   is an emergency or your down payment that you're going to need in 18 months, I think you'd...
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.160]   The regret... Again, the regret stuff, you'd much more regret not having enough for your
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.360]   down payment than you would making a little bit more and having a bigger down payment than you
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   expected. So I always err on the side of caution with that stuff. Because I think the downside is
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.000]   way bigger than the upside." And I would say, if you are thinking about where to put this stuff,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.120]   it's not all or nothing. You don't have to say, "I'm going to put all of it
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:50.960]   in a crypto savings account like BlockFi or all of it in Marcus and get half a percent."
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.480]   You could say, "Well, I'm gonna put 20% here and treat it as a blended rate. You're gonna get
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.120]   8% on half of it and almost zero on the other. It's more like a 4% return,
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.080]   but you're spreading the risk out." And that's effectively what I've done.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.280]   I would have kept all my money in the online savings account in the past. That was
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.360]   for my liquid savings. And now I've spread it out to 2 or 3 different places.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.720]   And again, so I don't have that concentration risk if something should go wrong.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.000]   And then I think you spread your bets that way. That makes sense.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.120]   For me, I think the cash that I hold for the short term doesn't necessarily have a purpose.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.160]   It's kind of like, "I just want some there." If the economy takes a downturn in 2020,
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.320]   I was glad I had a little cash on the sidelines when the market was down 20% or 30%.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   So I don't have a specific purpose. So I'm probably a little bit more comfortable with risk.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.680]   So I think I have the majority of it earning 8% or 9%. But for something like emergencies,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:44.640]   I keep a healthy cash buffer that earns nothing in a checking or a savings account that I just
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.760]   want to make sure is always there no matter what. That has the liquidity of "I can wire it out
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.320]   somewhere tomorrow or withdraw it at an ATM today. And I don't have to wait a day or two
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.080]   to transfer it from something." And that decision probably depends
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.240]   as much on your investor risk profile as it does on your circumstances in life.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.280]   I think I have kids now. I have three kids. And so
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   if I was single, I'd probably think about this and come at it a different way than
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.320]   if I had kids. Because it changes the way that you view risk. So I think that is part of it too.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.400]   What else do you have to potentially prepare for in terms of those downsides?
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.560]   I'm like you. I have liquid cash savings. I don't have it earmarked for anything.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.800]   I have buckets where I... This is our vacation fund. And this is for... I have some of those
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.600]   things. But then I have this cash that's just there just in case. Break if necessary.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:37.200]   Or if you find an opportunity. My old co-founder called it his elephant hunting fund.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:42.000]   And it was like, "I have this money sitting here in case some big opportunity comes across my way,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and I don't want to miss out on it." And he was like, "That could be a unique investment. That
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.560]   could be a down payment on a house. It could be something... The market crashes."
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.000]   And he's like, "I'm willing to give up the return on this because
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.080]   it's for an opportunity in the future that I hope will outperform the 2% or 3%."
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.760]   I have a home equity line of credit for the same reason. We took out a home equity line of credit
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.720]   because we bought our house in 2017 and housing prices are up, I don't know, 40% or 50% where we
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.640]   live. And I have all this equity sitting there. We paid down the house a little bit and mortgage
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.720]   rates are low. And so we opened up a decent-sized home equity line of credit for as much as they
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.040]   would give us. And that is my other fallback for this kind of thing where if I really need
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.280]   to write a big check for some reason, and I don't have to shuffle around all my other finances,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.000]   this is another financial backstop for me that I can use. And especially since rates are so low,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.760]   it's also not a bad way of using debt when you're borrowing at your house.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.920]   And you could do the same thing with your portfolio at pretty low interest rates. I've
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:43.120]   written in my newsletter in the past about some of the risks that borrowing comes with.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.080]   Things like getting a margin call if the market crashes. So I try to keep that to a percent that
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:53.200]   won't end up in any of those circumstances. At Wealthfront, we cap the portfolio borrowing at
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.320]   30%. And I don't think we've ever had to make a margin call because we've set it up in a way that
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.280]   it can withhold the kind of market drops that we expect in the worst-case scenarios, or at least
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.160]   the almost worst-case scenario. That's the other side of this low rates thing. People are earning
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.640]   really low rates on their savings. But the other side of that is low rates on your debt.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.440]   So you talk about using margin in a reasonable way. That's something that in the past would
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.640]   have seen, "No, why would you ever do that? That sounds stupid." But if you're using it
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.840]   just for a portion of your portfolio, you set up 20% or 30%, maybe 10%. With rates so low,
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:31.520]   that equation changes. And in the past, I would have been one who probably would have said,
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.120]   "I'm going to pay my house off." And in fact, the first house that my wife and I bought,
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.320]   we refinanced three times because our initial rate was 6.5%. And then we're down to in the threes.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.320]   And we were making the same payment and it was effectively a double payment.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.240]   And now that rates are so much lower, I think, "Why did I pay that off so much faster? I'm in
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.000]   no hurry to pay off my debt." And I know some people, they have this burning desire inside
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.880]   them like, "I have to pay off all debts." But for me, where the rates are, that's the other side of
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.120]   the... I'm not reading a lot of my savings, but my debt is not costing me much either. So I'm
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:07.040]   actually more comfortable using it a little bit in a reasonable manner. Yeah. So here's a question.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.000]   I get a lot from listeners and you probably have too. If I'm out there and I want to buy a million
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.040]   dollar house, it is totally reasonable for me to put down $250,000 and buy a million dollar house.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:26.640]   But it seems so unreasonable for me to use leverage in investing in the market.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.320]   And I know there are some reasons like margin calls and variable interest rates. But used
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:39.120]   responsibly, what opinion do you have on leverage in investing? Taking 30% or taking your home
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:46.080]   equity line and investing in the market, which in the long run has returned greater than the 1%
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.320]   or 2% that you're probably paying to borrow? I'll tell you what, when the market was down
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.080]   35% in March 2020, I was trying to get my home equity line of credit through so fast so I could
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.920]   take out of it and put it in the market. Now, that was during a crash situation, not now.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.720]   But I do think if you're doing it in a reasonable manner and you understand the potential downsides...
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.600]   And the great thing is if you're borrowing, it's your home. Again, not everyone has this
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.920]   opportunity if they don't own the home or they don't have enough equity. But you have a 10-year
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.280]   period to use a home equity line of credit in most instances, then you have 15 years to pay it off.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.040]   So it's not like you're going to get a margin call on that home equity line of credit if you used it.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   It's not like it's going to become right for you. If you borrow against your portfolio,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.120]   that could be different. But yeah, if you're doing it, if you have some sort of cap in mind,
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.200]   "I'm borrowing at $3 and I'm going to get $8." As long as you don't need that money for something
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.760]   else, and you understand any potential... The biggest downside, obviously, is "Well,
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.520]   the stock market falls 70% like a Great Depression and then I'm screwed." I guess
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:46.160]   if that happens, we have bigger problems on our hands. But I do think if you thought through it
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.080]   all, it's not the worst idea in the world if you can do it in a reasonable manner.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.520]   I would just say, make sure you have the horizons in mind, right? The stock market historically
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.960]   has returned much greater than the 1% or 2% or 3% interest rates you're paying right now.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:06.240]   However, the stock market has not performed greater than 1%, 2%, or 3% every single year.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:12.560]   And so it's probably not a safe bet to make it for a one-year bet, but it could be a safer
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.920]   long-term bet. Or at least as a long-term bet, it might be safer than a short-term bet. I guess
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.280]   it's never safe because we never know what's going to happen. But I will say one hack in here is that
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.360]   when you borrow money to invest, the interest you pay on that money is often deductible against
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.840]   the gains you have as investment interest expense. Depending on your tax rate, depending on a lot of
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:40.080]   circumstances, you might be paying 2.5% to borrow money. But if you invest that money and you have
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.440]   enough gains, dividends, interest to use it to deduct, that interest rate could cut as high as
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.240]   half off depending on your tax bracket and what state you live in. And again, I think where we
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.080]   are in the interest rate cycle has so much more... This would seem antithetical to personal finance
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.400]   people to say 10 years ago, right? You'd be nuts. Why would you borrow against your portfolio or
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.360]   invest more from borrowed money? But where rates are today, I think it's something that makes more
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:08.000]   sense than it did in the past. And another piece of rates that I think is similar that you mentioned
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.440]   earlier is inflation. All I hear about from everyone right now is what's going on. You guys
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.600]   have talked a lot about it on the show and have greater opinions than I do. Obviously, no one can
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.760]   predict what's happening. But what's your thought on what's happening with inflation and rates
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.440]   kind of outlook for 2022? I think the craziest thing is that we've never gone through anything
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.920]   like this. It's been four decades. I was born in 1981. That's basically the last time we had
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.200]   inflation this high. So you have... I know people always say, "Oh, if you just started investing in
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.840]   2020, you've never experienced A, B, or C." But unless you've been in this game for three or four
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:48.320]   decades, you really haven't experienced any inflation this high. I think from 2008 to 2020,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.440]   inflation was like 1.6% per year. Now it's 7%. And we've had higher economic growth because of that
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.920]   and all this other stuff going on. But I think that trying to come up with a short-term hedge
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.400]   to beat it in your investment portfolio is really difficult. I'm going to own gold or gold miners or
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.720]   commodities, whatever it is, and not thinking through how much of that is priced in and how
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:12.880]   much inflation needs to stay higher for some of those things. I still think that the stock market
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.720]   is probably your best bet for long-term inflation. So in that same period from 2008 to 2020,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.960]   the S&P 500 was up well over 10% per year, even with 2008 getting crushed.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.440]   And inflation was much lower. So that's why holding stocks over the long run is a good
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.920]   inflation hedges because you make up for it in those years when inflation isn't high. So your
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.080]   real returns there were way above average. So I think that's why holding stocks over the long
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.800]   run makes so much sense is because your real returns when inflation is low help make up for
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:46.240]   that what happens when inflation is higher and your real returns are lower. So the stat I always
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:52.640]   give is that over the last 100 years, the dividend payout on the S&P 500, the US stock market,
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:58.720]   has gone up at 2% above the rate of inflation. So you think, "Oh, I'm earning 1.7% in dividends on
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.080]   the S&P 500." That's nothing. It sounds paltry. But that dividend is growing every single year.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:10.480]   And it's because corporations are earning more and growing and innovating, they're paying out
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.320]   above the rate of inflation over the long term as well. And so that income is a growing stream
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   of income. That's why I still think that the stock market over the long run is by far your
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.360]   best hedge against inflation. And for cash, it's kind of tips beat a savings account these days.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.760]   And for anyone not listening, the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are government
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.120]   issued bonds or securities that you can invest in that beat inflation, or that's the goal?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.120]   That's actually almost an alternative investment. It's only been around in the US since the mid
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:46.480]   '90s. And effectively, what it does is it builds in the expected inflation. So it gives you a yield
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.600]   that is the Treasury bond minus what the market thinks inflation is going to be.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.640]   So your yield when you buy it is effectively negative. And then you add on inflation to it.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.960]   And so what it does is it gives you a one-for-one inflation, which is why the returns there were so
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.600]   high last year. You earned like 5% in tips last year, where if you invested in a total bond market
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.400]   fund, you were down like 2%, because that's a 7% different inflation. So you get a one-for-one
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.040]   inflation kicker. And where you really get the returns from there is if you get unexpectedly
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.720]   high inflation. Because again, the expected inflation is built in. So I think that is
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.080]   actually one of the... Yeah, maybe that's something we should have mentioned for a
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.800]   short-term vehicle is investing in inflation protected securities. Because that is in the
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:32.480]   short term, a big problem is that cash is earning nothing, and it's getting eaten away from inflation
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.680]   on a real basis. So yeah, those tips actually make a lot of sense in the short run, because
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.440]   that's the one thing you can invest in. You could say, "I want to invest in gold and all
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.280]   these other things." And even people said, "Well, Bitcoin is an inflation hedge." But these things
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.800]   don't move one-to-one with the inflation rate, because people are putting their expectations
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:54.320]   in on them and telling stories. Whereas tips give you that one-to-one hedge, where you're
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:59.360]   going to get exactly what the inflation is as your return basically. And they're not things where you
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.240]   have to go buy a bond from the government. There are ETFs. I think it's just tips is the ticker.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:04.560]   Yeah. Low-cost ETF.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.200]   You could just buy ETF. Yeah. So if you're thinking about how do you do this, for anyone
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.040]   who's ever bought a government bond from... I can't remember the site, and it feels old-school
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.600]   and complicated, this is easier. There's just an ETF for it.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.840]   But my one thing about inflation is that it's really, really difficult to hedge. So last year,
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.720]   you had the greatest setup for gold ever. The government was printing tons of money.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.400]   We finally had inflation. It was 7%. And gold was down like 5% or 6% on the year.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.600]   And for years, people are saying, "Buy gold because the Fed's printing money. The government's
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.960]   spending too much. Debt is at an all-time high." And gold drops in a year that all this stuff
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:45.040]   finally comes to a crescendo. And that's why the markets are so difficult to manage and try to get.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.560]   So that's why I think you can get too cute with these things and try to outthink things. Or you
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.720]   could invest in tips and understand, "I have a one-for-one. I'm not going to worry about it."
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.000]   That's the hedge. Yeah.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.320]   Did you know that electrolyte deficiency or imbalance can cause headaches, cramps,
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:07.040]   fatigue, brain fog, and weakness? Well, our sponsor today, Element, helps anyone stay hydrated
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:12.880]   without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients found in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.240]   I've been enjoying Element for the past year because it's a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.880]   born from the growing body of research revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.640]   occur at sodium levels two to three times government recommendations.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:33.360]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission to restore health through hydration and even works
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   when you're fasting or on a keto, low-carb, whole food, or paleo diet. And while you can always
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.800]   enjoy Element Cold, their new chocolate medley, which includes chocolate mint, chocolate chai,
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:50.720]   and chocolate raspberry, is actually designed to be enjoyed hot. Element is used by everyone,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.840]   from Olympic athletes to Navy SEAL teams to everyday parents. And if you're not sure it's

[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:37.440]   chef David Chang about leveling up your cooking at home? If not, definitely go back and give it
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:43.280]   a listen. But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit, I was a skeptic at
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:49.200]   first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from AnyDay, I'm a total convert and I'm
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.920]   excited to partner with them for this episode. AnyDay is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.960]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave. And honestly, using it feels like
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.560]   a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much. The cookware
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:11.040]   is 100% plastic free, and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in the same dish that
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:16.400]   happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too. And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.800]   off your AnyDay adventure, I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice. It is so good. And
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.840]   if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year, you have to

[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.320]   them. Maybe we'll do this again. I want to jump outside of investing a little bit and talk about
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   a few things. One is just ways to simplify your finances. And investing is a part of that. But I
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.440]   know you've had a lot of thoughts there. You have your own hacks to make things easier. I'd love to
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.400]   hear what you've got. My simplest hack, honestly, is just being optimistic about the future when it
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:33.280]   comes to finances. I think if you're one of these people that is always just down on the economy,
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.080]   the markets, what's the point of investing in the first place? So that's one thing.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.600]   I think if you're going to invest, the whole point of investing is that the future is going
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   to be better than today. Otherwise, why invest your money? So that's where I start. I think the
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.680]   rules-based thing applies to a lot of things. So obviously, automated saving, automated investing,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:52.000]   rebalancing. I also think bill pay, all these things that a lot of people have mentioned before.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.880]   One of the things I've done in recent years that I don't know why I didn't do before,
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.800]   but automated giving to charities. So on a monthly basis, anytime I find this good...
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.680]   In the past, around the holidays, or there was something going on,
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.240]   there was some catastrophic event, then I'd give some money and I'd do it in dribs and drabs.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.240]   Now I automate that. And I've actually gotten letters from these charities saying,
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:14.800]   "Thank you. We appreciate that. Because we know we're getting your monthly amount each month."
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.720]   That actually helps us plan out our finances for you. Obviously, it's not just me, but it's everyone.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.160]   And so actually, giving to these charities on a monthly basis, like you do with your savings
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:25.840]   automatically. And they almost all have an option for that now. You check a box saying,
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.880]   "I'm going to give $25, $50, $100 a month to this charity." And that's actually a really good thing
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.160]   for them for their planning purposes. I'll just chime in for a sec. There's a company
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.080]   I've mentioned in the past, or at least in my newsletter called Daffy, which is a donor-advised
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:38.480]   fund. Yes.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.920]   It's a new app. And it's interesting because it disintermediates... So donor-advised funds have
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.720]   historically been this thing, "Oh, here's an opportunity for people who are in really high
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:54.480]   tax years to donate a lot in one year and then be able to give over a series of years." So it's been
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.280]   a great thing for people who are, "Oh man, my company got acquired. I got some inheritance."
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   In that high tax year, you can actually donate money to a fund that you manage.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.840]   And then anytime in the future, you can donate money from that fund to a charity and you get
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.960]   the entire tax write-off at the beginning. And if you donate appreciated stock, you can often get...
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:18.400]   It even multiplies the tax benefit. But the cool thing they've added is the ability to set up
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:24.720]   recurring donations. And so I like that there's a disintermediation from, "I want to give,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.960]   and I know where I want to give." And so every now and then, there's a thing where, "Oh,
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.840]   I want to give to this cause." I don't always, like it sounds like you do, have the same cause
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.800]   every time. It might change on the circumstance, what's happening in the world. And so you can
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   actually set up automated giving and say, "I'm going to give $100 a month and not know where
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   it's going to go." And then while that money is sitting there, you can actually invest it.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.440]   So they even have a portfolio with a little bit of crypto. So I was like,
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.400]   "Oh, let's take a little bit of risk here." And so that's something I've started doing.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.360]   All the donations I make, I make them to Daffy. I keep it all managed there. I let it grow with
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.200]   the market. And then when I'm ready to donate it, I can do that whenever I want. And my wife and I
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.480]   both log into the app and she's like, "Oh, I'm going to send money to this thing right away."
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.400]   And Daffy didn't pay me to say any of this. But if you do want to check them out,
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.800]   I'd definitely love you to use my referral code. It gets you $25 for free.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:19.760]   It's at allthehacks.com/daffy. And the only downside is, I wish there was a way to use
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.600]   something like that with some of the online fundraisers. Because I always feel like the
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.560]   worst person saying, "Oh, you're raising money for this cause for your birthday."
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.960]   I was like, "I just sent a check to the cause on your behalf." And then they're like, "Yeah,
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.600]   but the meter didn't go up." And I was like, "I know. I did send..."
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.960]   I was like, "No, that the money's there. I'm really sorry. The meter didn't go up."
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.640]   I think that that's something I've changed my tune on.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.760]   So I mentioned asset allocation and how important that is for investing.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.280]   I like the idea of having a savings allocation too. So let's say you get
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:52.240]   a bonus at work. Or I don't know if you had an inheritance or a check for Christmas or something.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.480]   I don't know. Whatever it is. You get a chunk of money that you didn't expect you were going to
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:01.600]   get or it's just outside of your regular income. I like having an idea percentage-wise of how I'm
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.200]   going to save that money. So you don't just blow it on something. So I have a percentage that's
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.760]   going to go into retirement funds. I have a percentage that's going to go to brokerage,
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:13.440]   savings, maybe vacation. And then I always leave 20% to 30% where I'm just going to blow it on
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.800]   something. And I think it's important to have that in Scratch. That is because I talk about
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.440]   all this stuff about saving and investing and being rules-based. But I think this is... Again,
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:26.560]   since I've had my kids, something I've really come on... Changed my mind on is like,
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.920]   it's okay to spend money and have fun and do things for yourself and not just save everything.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.960]   So I think it's important to have that piece of your budget or your whatever it is, your money,
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.400]   that is going to just be there to have fun and blow in a guilt-free way where you don't have
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.640]   to worry about it. And you don't have to think every single decision you're making. Let's just
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.880]   have a little fun with this money, whatever it is. And it depends on the person what it's going
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.000]   to be. But I have that piece too, where it's just, "I'm just going to spend this. I'm going
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.400]   to blow it. And I'm not going to obsess over it." Are there some things you spent that money on
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:03.280]   that you'll share that are like, "Just got me to feel so good?" I think any sort of thing with my
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.000]   kids... I'm never going... Here's a little one that I... My daughter is 7 and she's getting
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.240]   into reading. So this is a dumb one. But I told her, "Anytime you want to buy a book from Amazon,
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.200]   I'm never going to say no. If you're going to read this..." She reads every night. I don't know
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.600]   how she got into this habit. And I told her, "Other stuff we're going to have discussions on.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.680]   But if you want to buy a book, and I'm going to see that you're reading them, I will buy you a
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.360]   book anytime you want. I'm not going to think about it." So just little... I think little
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.720]   things like that help. And then other things like I said, like family vacations and things
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:37.840]   like that stuff. I think creating those memories and experiences are always going to be useful.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.320]   Even though my wife is much more of a Disney person than me. My kids are so excited to do this.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   And my wife wanted to stay at the nice hotel right by... That's really close to the parks.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.600]   And in the past, I would have felt, "Well, why don't we stay at the cheaper one further away?"
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.880]   But I know this is going to be fun for the kids because there's a pool and stuff there and all
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.280]   this stuff. And that's the kind of thing where I'm not going to lose sleep over the fact that we're
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.720]   spending a little more on this vacation because the memories and experience is going to be...
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.320]   That's going to stay with us for a long time.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.840]   Awesome. I'm excited. My daughter's too young to really appreciate Disney,
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.680]   but I know that's in our future.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.080]   It's honestly not cheap. And everyone says once you get there,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.960]   they put this wristband on you that's attached to your credit card. And you...
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   Every time you want to spend money, all they do is have to swipe your wristband.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.520]   And it charges to your room. And I know it's a lot of money, but it's... Yeah. I think for
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.040]   the experience, it's totally worth it. Yeah. Any other hacks?
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.760]   You know, the simplest one that I always tell people, especially young people...
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.560]   And I wrote this in my book for people who... Let's say you're 40 or 50 years old and you're
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.240]   behind on retirement savings. And you think, "Alright, I'm going to become the next Warren
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.800]   Buffett. And I'm going to shoot the moon. And my stock picks or my investment prowess is going to
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.720]   propel my portfolio. And I'm going to be fine in retirement." This is in my retirement book.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:50.320]   And I said, "Let's say you... I use a simple round number like $100,000 household income.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:56.080]   You save 10% of it and you could earn 6% a year in the market. What happens after 10 and 20 years?"
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.400]   And then I said, "Okay, what happens if instead of earning 6%, you're able to earn 12%? You double
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.640]   it up, right? You're this great investor. Same savings rate, you double it up. Obviously,
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.480]   your money is going to be much higher. But now let's go the other way and say instead of saving
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.520]   10%, you double your savings rate and save 20%. But your return stays at 6%. You're not Warren
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.640]   Buffett. You can't double up the market. You only return 6%. Your return is actually higher from
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.160]   doubling your savings rate over 10 and 20 years than it is from doubling your investment return.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.440]   And doubling your investment return is way harder for most people than it is to double
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.720]   your savings rate. Because as we talked about, beating the market and picking stocks and these
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.760]   things is very, very difficult. And that's promised to no one. But most people can probably
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.120]   figure out ways to save more money. So I always tell people, especially when you're young, that
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.960]   saving is way, way more important than investing, even though investing is way sexier.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.840]   And it's funny, when you go from 10 to 20, it's a huge leap. But I always tell people,
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.640]   you can probably go from 10 to 11. You can probably go from 10 to 10 and a half.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:58.560]   And if you make those adjustments over time, most people end up... Their budget just fills the gap.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:03.120]   And obviously, if you try to take out 10%, it might be a little bit rocky. But if you try to
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:08.800]   take out 1% or 2% and just slowly add on to that, you become comfortable with it. And also anytime
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.280]   you get a raise, maybe just sweep the raise into that process. If you want to get to 20 and you
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.240]   get a 3% raise, just take 3% right away. You already know you can live without the raise.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:23.680]   Maybe take... To your advice, maybe take 2% and then put 1% in a fun fund so that you can go and
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.160]   spend some money and enjoy the fact that you worked hard, you got a raise. Yeah, the stair-step
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:33.200]   approach. When I first started out of college, I was making nothing. I think the most I could save
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.920]   in my Boring Target Date Fund was $50 a month. But then every year, I would bump it up a little
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.120]   bit more and maybe save half or three quarters of my raise and slowly got to that place where
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.400]   I wanted to get. But like you said, you can't... If you're ripping the bandaid off and going from
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.040]   10% to 20%, most people can't realistically do that. But you can do a slow stair-step approach
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:55.120]   where you increase either the percentage or the amount a little bit every year and get to that
[00:59:55.120 --> 01:00:01.520]   goal. Okay. Last thing before we head out, I would love to hear... You read a lot. You follow a lot
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.600]   of sub stacks. You follow a lot of people on Twitter. You stay on top of the market better
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.960]   than me. Are there a few people that you enjoy reading from or following that people listening
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   might want to check out if they want to stay on top of things? Other than you, of course.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:20.320]   I came up before the whole podcast, YouTube blog thing. I was actually talking to a college
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.160]   class recently. And I was asking them because they all seemed way smarter about the markets
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.720]   than I ever was at that age. I knew absolutely nothing. When I graduated in 2004 or whatever it
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:34.320]   is, I came out with very little knowledge. And the resources today are so much more easily
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.160]   accessible to people, especially young people. They're watching the YouTube videos and following
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.720]   the podcast and stuff. I learned a lot of my stuff that I... My way to catch up on my lack
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.880]   of knowledge was just reading books. I think anything written by William Bernstein is my
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.280]   favorite investment writer of all time. So probably his best well-known is The 4 Pillars
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.600]   of Investing, which is from the early 2000s. But he wrote one after the 2008 crash called
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.320]   The Investor's Manifesto. He was a former brain surgeon who turned investment advisor.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.680]   And it's probably one of the smartest people I know. So anything by William Bernstein
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.360]   is very good. There's also this book called... And I'm looking for some underrated ones here,
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.000]   not the ones that you can just Google and say, "What are the best investing books?"
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.840]   What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars by... The story about this guy, Jim Paul,
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.280]   have you heard of this one before? No.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.560]   He was a commodities trader in the 1980s. And he talked about being this young hot shot commodities
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.880]   trader who made a ton of money, had no idea what he was doing, and he made all this money.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.240]   And he talked about how it messed with his head. And he thought all the profits he was making were
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.280]   because he was so smart and successful. And then when he lost it all, he realized, "Oh wait,
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.080]   I was actually just an idiot. I didn't know anything. I got lucky."
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.360]   And it's his emotional journey of going from this young guy who became this hot shot commodities
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.160]   trader and then losing all the money and what happened and his journey of figuring out what
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.960]   that all meant, and how you shouldn't personalize successes, and how much luck is involved,
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.000]   and how just because you make money doesn't mean you made the right decision.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.840]   And just because you lose money didn't mean you make the wrong decision. Sometimes it's just
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.120]   the fate of the market. So that's actually one of my favorite investing books that I've ever read
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.400]   about the psychology behind it. I love that. And I love benchmarking yourself. I think in 2020,
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.920]   so many people were like, "Oh, I made so much money in the market." Or 2021 also.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.760]   And I'm like, "Okay, but how did that compare to the market?"
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.680]   Because you can look like you got a 20% return. But if the market went up 20%,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.880]   then you just got the market return. And so I think that's a lesson that takes more than
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.840]   a couple minutes to process. But it sounds like he learned that also. So I'll check that out.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.760]   Anything that you use day-to-day, week-to-week? What's your go-to source of market news?
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:42.000]   Honestly, for me, I've curated a list of people to follow on Twitter. And I know social media,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.120]   there's a lot of bad things about it. But I think if you have the right filters in place,
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.560]   and can figure out to follow the right people to pay attention to this stuff,
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.240]   and just filter out the people who are just going to waste your time,
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.240]   I think there's actually a lot of signal there as opposed to noise if you follow the right people.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.000]   So I guess if you're listening, just check out who Ben follows.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.120]   There you go. That's a good list.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.080]   My follower list.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.480]   Awesome. And perfect time. Where can people find everything you're doing? Podcasts,
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.680]   book, writing, everything?
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.120]   Yeah. It's probably easiest just to check out my website, A Wealth of Common Sense.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.000]   I've been doing that for going on 9 or 10 years now. I write everything there and put all the
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.840]   podcasts up there so that you can find me. Awesome. I'll link to all that in the show notes.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.160]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:22.960]   Awesome. It was fun.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.160]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you so much for listening.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.120]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.800]   I would really appreciate it. Especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.720]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.960]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:55.360]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
