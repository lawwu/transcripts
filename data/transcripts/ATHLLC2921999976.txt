[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.240]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.960]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.640]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.240]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you here.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.800]   Now, it probably won't surprise you to learn that one of the reasons I started a
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.920]   podcast is that I really enjoy listening to podcasts myself.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   And while I follow a lot of them, there's only a few I listen to every week.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.720]   One of those is a podcast called Animal Spirits, which as they say, is a show
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.360]   about markets, life, and investing.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.040]   And today, I'm chatting with one of the hosts of that show, Ben Carlson.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.000]   Ben is a financial advisor and the Director of Institutional Asset Management
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.560]   at Ritholtz Wealth Management.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   He's also the author of four books about saving, investing, and money, the first of
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.360]   which shares a name with the blog he's been writing since 2013, A Wealth of
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.160]   Common Sense.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.280]   Ben's one of my go-tos for questions about investing and personal finance, and I'm
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.960]   excited to have him here to chat about markets in 2022, inflation, interest rates,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.680]   recessions, alternative assets, stock investing, and his favorite ways to hack
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   and simplify your finances and investments.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.720]   That is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.800]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.680]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.880]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.840]   investment decisions.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.800]   Ben, thanks for being here.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Hey, Chris.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   Nice to be here.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   So I'm just going to kick off.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.440]   I listened to your podcast this morning and you said, "I'm done picking stocks."
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   (laughs)
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   What changed?
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   (laughs)
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   My returns, maybe?
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   I don't know.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   (laughs)
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   I've had a love-hate relationship with picking stocks.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   For some reason, I've always been a simple index fund, target fund investor, for the
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   most part.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.200]   My very first purchase in the stock market was a target date fund.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   My dad helped me set up an IRA right out of college.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.760]   And I've just dabbled here and there.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   And I go on and off.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   I go on these streaks.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.640]   Then in 2020, when things were just getting crushed, I thought, "Why not wade back into
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   it?"
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   It was really fun.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   I had a Robinhood account.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   I bought a bunch of stocks.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.720]   Everyone's stocks were going up that year.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.400]   And I'm buying the things most people are, right?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   I have a little crypto.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640]   I have some growth stocks.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   And that was really fun.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   And things are going high.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.120]   And then I have this other part of my portfolio that's just working on automatic and it's
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.520]   a boring and all this other stuff.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.800]   So it was a way to scratch an itch.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.280]   And then 2021 and 2022 happened.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   And all these growth stocks that I bought because it was fun are getting killed.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.540]   And it's just a good reminder of just how hard it is.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.240]   Because I talked on our show today, I had this thesis.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.360]   And I've been thinking for a while.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.240]   I think I said in 2017, "Eventually, millennials are going to grow up like everyone else.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.920]   And they're going to buy houses.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.360]   And we're not building enough houses right now.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   So I think housing is going to be strong."
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.640]   And I didn't think it was going to be nearly as strong as it is.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.160]   But I've had this thesis.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   And I see last year, Zillow is down 50%.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.760]   And I think, "Geez, this is a company that was just on SNL.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   It's really popular.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   It's the biggest brand name in the United States as far as housing goes.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.360]   Everyone likes to play around on Zillow.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.860]   Why don't I pick up some shares on the cheap?"
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.360]   And then from those 50% down levels, it's fallen another 50%.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.440]   And I guess maybe it's a good reminder to me that just how hard it is to pick stocks.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.240]   And that's why I'm just like, "You know what?
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.080]   I know some people find a lot of joy in it and entertainment.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.920]   And some people are very good at it."
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   For me, there's just so many first, second, third, fourth level thinking that you have
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240]   to do to get it right.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.640]   So even if you're right on the macro stuff, you could be completely wrong about a company
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.200]   or a company can just not fulfill its promises and expectations.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.040]   And it's just easier for me to do a lot of other stuff than pick stocks.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.880]   I have had similar bets.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.760]   The bet I regretted for all of 2021 was... Or maybe it was even 2020 was "Gosh, I didn't
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.840]   buy Peloton.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   I love my Peloton.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   I should have bought it.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.760]   I watch it rise and rise and rise."
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.800]   And then it was just down and down and down.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.560]   So fortunately, I never bought it and I didn't lose as much as I probably could have.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.960]   But every time it was down, I thought it was another time to buy and it just kept going
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   down.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   And for every one of those that you kick yourself for, "Oh, this was so obvious.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.200]   Why didn't I see it?"
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.760]   There's 10 other examples of ones that you probably would have bought and just did terrible.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.560]   And I think the market especially has just shown these last 4 or 5 years how difficult
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.840]   it really is to beat.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.400]   And maybe some people don't do it with their eye on "Well, I'm going to outperform the
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   market.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   I'm going to have this alpha."
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   And that wasn't my thing either.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.960]   I have this, what I call a fun portfolio.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.880]   It's 5% or 10% of my investable assets.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.840]   And I do it just to follow some stocks and trends that I think are interesting.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.480]   But even that, I think there's enough ways to scratch an itch that you want to have an
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.640]   entertaining portion of your portfolio.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   There's other ways to do it these days where for me, it doesn't involve stock picking.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.560]   And I already have these other investments in the stock market using low-cost index funds
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.360]   that can get the job done anyway.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.520]   So what are those things?
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.480]   If you're not going to scratch the itch with stocks, I agree.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.680]   Most of my assets are in long-term diverse portfolio of index funds and it's boring.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.520]   The best I get is a push notification that's like, "Oh, we did some tax loss harvesting."
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   I'm like, "Oh, cool."
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   But that's kind of it.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.680]   How do you scratch the itch now?
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.080]   So I'm probably going to leave my Robinhood portfolio.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.560]   So I own some crypto.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.460]   I've dabbled in art from a place like Masterworks.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.600]   And Fundrise allows you to invest in real estate, direct real estate on a private basis.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.360]   I've started getting into startups in the last 12 months, which sounds like everyone
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360]   is doing.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   I don't think any of these things I'm getting into are unique by any means.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.700]   So I have some of this other stuff that I'm doing.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   And I get to talk about it all the time.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700]   You mentioned my podcast.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.760]   I talk about this stuff on a weekly basis.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.000]   And for me, that's almost as fun as investing in it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.600]   It's just talking about it and so I just don't think I need it anymore.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.080]   And I think there's a lot of time and effort you have to put into this stuff if you're
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   really going to be good at it.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.480]   Because it seemed like in 2020, you could just buy a stock that you knew, a company
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.600]   that you knew, or a brand that you liked, and that was easy enough.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.160]   But you have people out there who are really putting in the work and they have a hard time
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   beating the stock market.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.840]   They have these PhDs and quants and people who went to Ivy League schools that just are
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   really, really smart.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.400]   And they have a hard time outperforming the market.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.760]   So I think for me, I'll probably eat these words someday and come back to it, I'm sure.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.400]   But for now, I have enough other stuff going on in my life.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.880]   It's almost like I hear people talk about fantasy football.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.520]   And they're always like, "Why do I do this?
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.320]   All it is is pain, and time consuming, and I never get anything out of it.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.840]   And if I win, who cares?
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.640]   And if I lose, I just feel like a jerk and it's not that fun."
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:45.120]   So to me, it's kind of like that, where it's like the risk/reward is not tilted in my favor.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.180]   And it's like, "Why even do it then?"
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.180]   It's funny.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.640]   With fantasy football, it was one of those things where I would get so into it.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.360]   And the prize at the end of the day for our league was like $500.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.560]   And I was like, "Man, the hours I've spent..."
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.680]   And finally, I think I do miss that fun aspect of the banter around it.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.360]   And I wish I could bring that back.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.800]   But for me, it was just hard to play it casually.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.880]   So when I started a company, I was like, "I'm out.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.960]   I don't have the time for this.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.680]   If I do it, it's going to occupy so much headspace."
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.400]   But one of the things you said that's interesting is about some of these alternatives.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.960]   A thing that I take away from all of this access is that a lot of these new alternatives,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.080]   whether it's wine or art or real estate, they're still like long-term portfolio-driven bets,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.240]   whereas stocks often feel like a short-term single bet.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.360]   And so you get this marriage of the excitement, but something a little more similar to a long-term
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.440]   strategy, which I think has made me more interested in that.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.520]   So instead of picking stocks in the last 2 years, I've gone in, I've picked some art
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.320]   or I've picked some startups or stuff like that, just with a small piece of the portfolio,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.280]   but still making portfolio bets, which I think, in my opinion, is a little bit less risk and
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   more diversified, but of things that are more exciting than just the entire market.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.840]   And I think at this stage of my life where I've been doing this for a while now, I don't
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.400]   need to see those marks every day to make me fulfilled and see the scoreboard and I'm
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.840]   winning or losing.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   Sports gambling online is legal now in Michigan.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.160]   So I've been doing that for the last year, just very little amounts and it's just entertaining.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.940]   And at least that's the kind of thing where you either win or lose after the outcome.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.200]   You don't have to wait and see.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.720]   Like in the stock market, if you pick up that stock, you can get killed every day.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   That scoreboard is just staring you in the face every day.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.400]   So I like having this stuff that maybe is not quite as liquid, but you also don't see
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.480]   the fluctuations every day.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.160]   And that's why owning a house is often the best financial asset for so many people, even
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.480]   though if you compare the returns of the stock market over time, maybe it's not the greatest
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.280]   investment in the world, but because it's like a forced savings vehicle and you're forced
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.920]   to hold it, and every day someone's not coming to you and saying, "This is the value now."
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.560]   No, this is the value now.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.960]   It makes you a longer term investor.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.720]   And that stuff has been way more helpful to me, just having a long-term mindset.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.200]   And I think looking at individual stocks every day and how they move by 5% or 10% is not
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   really helpful.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.440]   I think Andy Ratcliffe, the founder of Wealthfront, came on the podcast and said, "Look, if having
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.760]   a small amount of money in something exciting is what lets you leave a huge amount of money
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.400]   or the vast majority of your portfolio in something tried and true, like a diverse passive
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.680]   set of index funds, then great.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.080]   It's the price you're going to pay for the 95% of your portfolio being in the thing you
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.080]   really want."
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.080]   It's probably better.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.320]   But at the end of the day, it's unlikely that you will consistently outperform because people
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.440]   that do this for a living are not consistently outperforming.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.200]   And we tell this to our clients, too.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.800]   It's good to have that behavioral resale for that part to say, "I'm actually doing something.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.020]   I feel like my hands are on the steering wheel and this other stuff that's more automated
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.400]   and rules-based and boring and taken care of.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   This allows me to do something."
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.480]   And I also think it's a good comparison because you can say, "This really is hard."
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.360]   But doing it on a consistent basis, I can see that just having a smaller piece of my
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.120]   portfolio, I'm not going to wreck everything.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.480]   So I think there's something to that.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   A question I have.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.320]   So stocks used to be the fun thing, but they're actually a component of most people's long-term
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   passive portfolio as well.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.240]   A lot of these new alternatives, I'm curious, you've thought about this both from an institutional
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.760]   standpoint and with clients at the firm, how do you think about some of these alternatives
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.440]   fitting into that longer-term portfolio as well?
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.520]   Whether that's crypto or real estate or art or wine or things like that, they can be fun.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   But are they also a part of a long-term diverse strategy?
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.160]   Here's how I've dealt with it personally.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.320]   I want the rest of my financial house in order before I ever even talk about alternatives.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.800]   So I'm maxing out my 401k.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.500]   I have a SEP IRA that I'm putting money into.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.680]   My kid's 529.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.520]   I have that emergency fund, all that stuff.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.140]   So all of that boring stuff is taken care of.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.960]   And then after that's taken care of, then I move on to alternatives.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.600]   Now, obviously, maybe not everyone gets to that point where they're maxing everything
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.300]   out depending on their means or whatever, their income.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.120]   But I think that's the idea is make sure you have everything else shored up first and then
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.480]   figure out how this stuff can fit within your portfolio.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.920]   I know a lot of these platforms, say we're democratizing investing, we're making it easy
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.240]   and they have low minimums and all this stuff.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.440]   And it's great to have access to this stuff.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.920]   But I think that you have to have these other building blocks in place before you ever even
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.200]   consider some of this stuff, especially if you really don't know what you're doing and
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.360]   don't understand how some of this stuff works.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.880]   And would you put things like crypto in that bucket as well?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.880]   Probably.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.120]   I know a lot of young people probably think it would be nuts to say that because they
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.480]   want to put a lot of their assets in that.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   But I do think it makes sense to have that stuff, especially since it's so speculative
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.040]   and moves around so much and so volatile.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.240]   Having some of these things in your life that aren't going to move as much and just be like
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.760]   the building blocks that you don't have to worry as much about and then have fun.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.960]   Again, for me, it's 5% or 10% of the portfolio for my fun brokerage account or whatever.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.520]   But for other people, that may be a different number.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.760]   So I think you have to figure out what you're comfortable with.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.840]   But I think you have to have some sort of level or ceiling on these things so it doesn't
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.520]   totally get out of control.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.760]   And either when it goes down, you're going to be in the pits of despair and try to freak
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.600]   out and "What am I going to do?"
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.680]   Or if it gets too high, then you go, "Well, now what do I do?
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.080]   It's 50% of my portfolio."
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.200]   If you don't have some sort of line in the sand or reasoning ahead of time, it's going
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.440]   to be hard to figure out what to do with it when it gets to either too low or too high.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.160]   That's where I think software that can take care of that is helpful.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   Obviously, I work at Wealthfront.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.880]   I love that if something goes too high, I don't have to think about it because man,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.480]   I was in that situation with crypto.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.040]   It's higher percentage of my portfolio than I want.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   And now I'm like, "But I don't want to sell it."
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.400]   Even though I know I should.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.280]   It's like coming to that conviction is really hard.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.800]   Any advice to people who have ideas of what they want to do, but struggle to actually
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   put them into place?
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.040]   Unfortunately, that's why you have to have some of these things in advance.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.160]   I use this example in my book, they actually did a study of prison inmates.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.440]   And they found, surprisingly, even though they don't have as much access to food, and
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.480]   they get all this time probably to work out if they want to, like from the movies and
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.040]   TV shows that you think, "Oh, everyone at prison is just getting ripped and working
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   out all the time."
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.080]   They actually found these 100 inmates they studied, 90% of them actually gained weight
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.320]   being in prison.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.000]   And they tried to figure out, "Well, why is this?"
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.400]   And what they found was they were those big jumpsuits, and there's no belt or anything
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.240]   around the waist, and they had nothing to restrict them and let them know or give them
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.920]   some sort of like, "What's happening to my body?"
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.040]   They had no idea.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.640]   So and some of these people were surprised, "I can't believe I gained 15 pounds in prison.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.920]   I thought this is going to be a chance for me to work out and lose weight."
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.740]   And it's because they had no restrictor there to let them know that things were getting
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.900]   out of control.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.800]   So I think you have to go into it with these investments thinking...
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.720]   So let's say you bought Bitcoin back in the day and you said, "Okay, I have two options.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.600]   I can let this be a buy and hold forever.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.480]   And whatever percentage of my portfolio it goes to, that's what it's going to be.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   I'm just going to let it run and it's going to be its own little bucket."
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   Or you could say, "All right, I'm going to do the portfolio management thing here.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.800]   And every time it gets to 10% of my portfolio, I'm trimming.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.080]   And every time it gets to five, I'm adding."
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.900]   And so I think you have to go into it with that.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.300]   Because if you try to do it after the fact, if it's grown to 15% or 20% or 30%, at that
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.060]   point you're going, "I don't know what to do.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.340]   Because what if it keeps growing and getting bigger?
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.980]   And what if I sell now and I feel like an idiot?"
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.680]   Because the whole process of investing is this premise of regret minimization.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.520]   What would I regret more?
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.000]   It goes to 50% but I sold early or it falls and it goes back to 5% of my portfolio and
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.240]   I never sold anything.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.720]   Which one would be more painful to you?
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.000]   And some people...
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   It's personality driven.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.400]   But for some people, it really...
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   Who knows?
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   It depends what affects you more.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   So for you, what would it be?
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.200]   Would you be more worried if all your crypto crashed 90% and now it's so small and you
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.720]   go, "Oh man, I never rebalanced once."
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.320]   Or if it kept going up and you sold a little and you actually locked in some gains?
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   For me, it's funny.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.740]   Living in Silicon Valley, I think so many people are participating in this new asset
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.560]   class that if everyone...
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.160]   For me, if everyone else sees it go to the moon, as we say, and I was just on the sidelines,
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.160]   I would feel bad.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.360]   So for me, I put a small amount of my portfolio in this.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.520]   Yes, it's grown a lot.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   I'm holding it.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   I keep saying forever, but I'm in the buy and hold camp for what I did.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.920]   And yes, it's a higher percentage of the portfolio.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.540]   But when it went in, it was just almost an insignificant amount.
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.040]   To be honest, I'm with you.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.400]   I bought a very small amount in 2017 because like you, I wasn't a true believer in crypto.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.840]   But I said, "I can see what's coming and I've studied human nature and behavior.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.200]   And if this thing gets so big, and all these tech people are saying this stuff, and I miss
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.440]   out, I'm going to kick myself."
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   So I put some money in.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   And I said at the time, "I'm buying and holding this forever."
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.880]   Whatever forever could change, I guess, someday.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   But I'm basically...
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   I'm not going to trim it.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.880]   I'm not going to...
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   I'm going to let this thing go.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.160]   And it's going to be its own entity.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.760]   But then the rest of my portfolio, I have these bans around allocations and weights
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.840]   and rebalancing and all this stuff.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.400]   But I think you have to have that discussion with yourself ahead of time.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.120]   Because if you're doing it after the fact, your judgment is gonna be so clouded by whatever
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   the price is.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   I think that's the...
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.160]   My big takeaway is whatever your plan is, just come up with an idea of what you want
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.520]   to do when you put it in place.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.240]   If you put a portfolio in and say, "I want to rebalance this," say, "Here's what I'm
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   going to do it."
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.080]   Because it's way harder to make those decisions after the fact.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.400]   I always tell people like even a bad plan is better than no plan at all.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.840]   Because at least a bad plan has some sort of guidelines and gives you some sense of
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   what to do.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.220]   And it's like winging it, which I know a lot of people are when they first get started.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.600]   And that makes it 10 times scarier when something goes down.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.160]   Because if you don't have a plan for planning in advance that my stocks or my crypto or
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.280]   whatever is going to get killed, if you're just hoping it's not going to, eventually,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   you're going to be wrong.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   It's not going to work out for you.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.140]   I know you've spent a lot of time on the institutional side.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:43.160]   And institutional funds, especially things like endowments, they're the golden example
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.640]   of how to invest.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.920]   Are there lessons that you've taken away from how institutions invest that would be
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.960]   great for people to adopt or maybe some that shouldn't even apply that would be helpful
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   to hear?
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   It's funny.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.640]   I like to look at the difference between institutions and individuals from the lens of mistakes.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:08.400]   And so most individual mistakes come from being naive and not understanding enough before
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.720]   they invest in something, again, and not having a plan.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.600]   You can't say that about institutional investors like endowments and foundations I've worked
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   with.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.000]   They have boards and committees, and they have everything documented.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.880]   And they pretty much have all that stuff in place.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.440]   They have these plans.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.960]   Their problem is that they're all so smart that they get overconfident in their abilities.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.760]   And they think that they're just they're going to outthink and outsmart everyone.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.300]   And so it's like different ends of the mistake curve or whatever, where the really smart
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.420]   people who have all this money, just assume that because they're so intelligent, they
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.200]   have so many resources that outperforming should be easy for them.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.160]   And then the other end, you have the naive individuals who haven't thought through this
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.680]   stuff and don't know how hard it is yet because they haven't experienced it or paid the market
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.240]   gods their tuition.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.920]   They don't understand that, "Oh, yeah, wait, this is really hard to do."
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.880]   So that's the way that I look at it.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.800]   As far as learning for institutions, I always tell people, it's just a few more zeros that
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   they have.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.080]   I've worked with a billion dollar foundations before.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.440]   And I don't think that you can really throw out the basic building blocks of having some
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.460]   sort of investment policy in place and having an asset allocation.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.560]   And I know this stuff is so boring to most people.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.640]   But that's the thing where the difference between managing a billion dollars for an
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:21.200]   endowment and a million dollars for a family is just a few zeros, as far as investment
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   policy goes.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.880]   They still have to pay attention to the risk profile and time horizon and understand an
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.680]   asset allocation that suits their needs and their ability to take risk and all this stuff.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.840]   So it seems like there should be this one path for these institutions because they're
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.860]   so big and have so many resources, and then something else for the little guy.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.440]   But I don't think it has to be that way.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.560]   And that's honestly, one of the reasons that I was banging my head against the wall when
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.160]   I worked in that field.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.760]   Because I wanted those big institutions to simplify the way that they invested.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.700]   And a lot of them wanted to make it way more complex than I thought it had to be.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.940]   So I want to ask a question on asset allocation.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.280]   If someone's listening and that's an unfamiliar term, and they're sitting here like, "Whoa,
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   what's going on?
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   I bought a few stocks.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.920]   I haven't even thought about that."
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.200]   Is there a place you'd point them to get started?
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.800]   I know we could do a whole episode just on asset allocation.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.240]   So maybe that's in the future.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.960]   But where would you point someone to get started thinking about their risk profile and the
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.340]   portfolio they should build?
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:23.480]   I think thinking through what's happened just in the last couple decades of the stock market
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.440]   is probably not a bad place to be.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   So let's say in 2008, the stock market fell 50%, maybe 55% in the US stock market.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.280]   Some other stock markets fell more.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.520]   If you have all your money in stocks, that's something you should plan on happening at
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.840]   least a few times throughout your lifetime, depending on your age.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.580]   You'll probably see your portfolio get cut in half if you have all your money in stocks.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.760]   And then think about bonds right now, basically, because yields are so low, like cash.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.700]   If you have your money in cash, it's not going to earn much for you, but it's also not going
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.640]   to go down in value, nominally, a stock market can.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.700]   We can talk about inflation, all that stuff that eats into cash.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.500]   So obviously, the levers here are hold more cash or less cash, and that's going to decrease
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.440]   your volatility and losses, but potentially decrease your returns.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.600]   And for most young people, a lot of people who think just like type A personality, everyone
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600]   should be rational.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.400]   You have to have all your money in stocks because you have all this time ahead of you.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.280]   You're going to be saving more.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.620]   You have this human capital as the wind behind your sails.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.520]   And put all your money in stocks because you can handle it.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.760]   But some people, because of their personality, their emotional makeup, they can't.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.760]   They really just can't.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.440]   They couldn't withstand a 50% crash in the stock market without selling and tapping out
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.760]   and saying, "Uncle."
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.160]   So I think a lot of it has to do with your personality.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.320]   But that's the idea, is how much more safe, liquid stuff do you need that will allow you
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.080]   to leave the stock market investments alone?
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.480]   And so is that 10% in cash and bonds or 20%?
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.600]   Whatever it is, whatever that lever is, some people can handle the volatility and other
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   people just can't.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.840]   And the worst thing to do is make a mistake at the worst possible time and sell out of
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.560]   your stocks when they're already down.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.000]   That's the worst thing.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.760]   So yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with your personality.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.480]   But yeah, that whole asset allocation thing, there's no perfect number for anyone.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.360]   You can't just say like, "Oh, for you, it's $95,500."
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.960]   It's unfortunately, there's no such thing as a perfect portfolio.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.200]   It's only known in hindsight.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.920]   But people have to get something that they can be comfortable with.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.600]   Because if you have this perfect, optimized portfolio, great, but you can't stick with
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   it.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   It's effectively useless.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.880]   Is there a book or a blog post of yours or someone else's that you'd say is a good starting
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.400]   point for thinking about this?
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.240]   So Wealth of Common Sense, my first book you mentioned.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.200]   I have a whole chapter in there about asset allocation and diversification and rebalancing
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.240]   that goes through some examples between a 50/50 stock bond portfolio or 100/0 and all
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   those things.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.920]   So I have a whole chapter on that, I think, in that one.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.520]   And if all of this is crazy, and you're like, "I just want something simple."
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   There's 2 things.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.400]   There's target date funds, which is like just pick a fund.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.520]   And there's usually a year associated with it that affects the portfolio and changes
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.800]   over time.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.520]   Or I'd be mistaken to not mention that I work for a company that offers a very simple robo
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.400]   portfolio that you could just put money in and take a risk quiz and it'll rebalance for
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   you.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   So those are the simple options.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.360]   And I know there's a lot of people who say like, who will try to find issues with taking
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.960]   those risk questions or a target date fund.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.000]   But to that I say, what's the alternative?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.660]   I think these robo advisors and target date funds are some of the best leaps forward we've
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.480]   had for individual investors in a long, long time.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.560]   It started with index funds and then we get to these things now that are a whole portfolio
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.000]   in one for you, just through the click of a button, basically.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.960]   And I think it's fantastic for the vast majority of investors, especially if you're just starting
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.800]   out and don't know what to do.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   One question.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.520]   You work at an RIA or a firm for financial advisors.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.680]   Is there something you would tell a friend that said, "Should I be working with a financial
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   advisor?
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   When does that matter?
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.800]   Who is that important for?"
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.760]   I hear a lot of people that fall into money and they're like, "Well, now that I have a
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.080]   million dollars, now it's time to work with a financial advisor."
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.360]   I'm curious what your perspective is on that.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.480]   I think a lot of people who optimize their lives and they listen to your podcast and
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   look for these hacks.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.640]   A lot of them will probably say, "I'm a DIY person.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.880]   I will never need an advisor.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   I can do it myself."
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.200]   And honestly, there's a lot of people who do put in the work and don't really need an
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   advisor.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.920]   They can probably find the right resources on their own if they look hard enough and
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.000]   they can handle it.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.360]   But the people that come to us do so for a number of reasons.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.400]   One of them is just that they are busy and they have other stuff going on in their lives
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.360]   and they don't care about this stuff as much as you and I do.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.560]   You and I obsess over this stuff and we read about it and we follow it and listen to podcasts
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.640]   and we do our own podcasts.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   And that's great.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.960]   But some people just don't have the time or the inclination to do all the stuff that all
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.360]   the work that we've put into this because we actually like this.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.040]   Other people would say like, "What is wrong with you dorks?
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880]   Why do you care about this stuff so much?"
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.000]   But we love it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Some people don't.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   They just want to outsource.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.520]   And they do this with other areas of their lives too where they're outsourced to tax
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.680]   providers or lawyers or whatever.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.320]   And so that's probably a big one.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.360]   The other one is just when you have a big life event.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.000]   So for a lot of people, recently, that's retirement, right?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.800]   We've got a lot of people come to us and say, "I've been doing this myself for 30 years.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   I've saved.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.000]   I've got this whole retirement nut here.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.160]   But I'm nervous I'm going to mess it up.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.160]   And I don't want that to happen.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.120]   And I want someone else to take the steering wheel and help me make better decisions."
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.800]   A lot of people are worried about, "Hey, I've been managing money myself forever.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.000]   What about my kids or my spouse that doesn't pay attention as much as me?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.960]   I want someone else there to help make decisions if I get hit by a bus or something."
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.120]   So I think those are a few.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.960]   I think a lot of times when your financial life does get complex, for me, a simple one,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:30.280]   from the time I had my first job at 15, my dad, who is a financial nerd himself, taught
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   me to do my own taxes.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.240]   And he thought that I could learn something by doing that and I thought it was great.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.820]   And I've done my own taxes for 20 plus years until about 2 years ago, when my life got
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.160]   more complex.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.840]   And we have a tax team on staff.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.920]   And I handed it over to them because my life got more complex because I became a shareholder
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.240]   in the firm and I had all these weird K1 things going on and it became way too complex for
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.240]   me to handle.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.800]   And even though my dad wanted to help me through it, I'm like, "Dad, all right.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   It's enough.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   I'm handing it over."
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.620]   And so some people just have that happen where they have an inheritance or an estate planning
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.760]   issue or something in their tax life.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.640]   I know a lot of times people think you hand over your money to an advisor because they're
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.600]   going to help you manage your portfolio.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.880]   Portfolio management is one piece of it.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.760]   But there's so much else that goes into it from taxes and estate planning to passing
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.640]   your money along and making good decisions.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   So I think that's a big one too.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.720]   It's just your life has become a little too complex, your financial life, that you need
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.740]   someone else to just take over for you.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:28.280]   And I'll point out that for anyone listening, there are financial planners out there that
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.940]   help people go through a lot of these decisions that aren't investment managers.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.000]   It's not all or nothing.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   There are people...
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.560]   I'll link to a couple places where you can find them in the show notes.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.680]   But there are people that you can say, "Hey, I'm going to pay a fee."
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.760]   Kind of like you pay a tax advisor each year and say, "I want to run through everything.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.200]   I want to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   What am I doing right?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.620]   Where should I be thinking?"
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.620]   Exactly.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.040]   And then you can keep managing your investments.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.100]   So I think there are multiple options here and it's not all or nothing.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.120]   It's not, "I have to give up every piece of control."
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.200]   And that's great is that because of the internet, it's wide open.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.760]   In the past, you would have had to go to your local person down the street.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.840]   And that was the only option.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.720]   There's so many options for people to get help.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.880]   And even at some of the big financial institutions now, they'll have a call center of financial
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.360]   planners there that you can call and talk to.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.680]   And like you said, an hourly planner.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.600]   Pretty much anything you want now you can get if you look hard enough.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.000]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   emerge.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.720]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual processes
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.160]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:37.400]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.040]   37,000, that's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.960]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.680]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.640]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.080]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days, not
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.620]   weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.800]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.400]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   of truth.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.840]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.620]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the companies
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.560]   I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.260]   N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.480]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   for you.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.080]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.100]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.020]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:08.180]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.620]   tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:17.660]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.740]   commonly found in plants.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:25.180]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.240]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.820]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.540]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:44.620]   metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.960]   things to drink.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.540]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:54.460]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.020]   Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.380]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free U.S.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.600]   shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.220]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:18.260]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:24.220]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.260]   I want to come back to a few things that you mentioned, because there's a lot that can
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.260]   come from that.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.300]   One is, you talked about retirement accounts, and it's important to put money in retirement
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.660]   accounts first before you think about alternatives.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.540]   And I just want to tap on...
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.260]   There's a different perspective I've heard recently, which is as you're young, liquidity
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.260]   is really important.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.100]   When you put money in retirement accounts, you can't use it for a down payment.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.220]   You can't use it to do anything other than save for retirement without paying fees.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.460]   Do you still think that the right guidance is always max out all retirement accounts?
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.900]   Or is there a perspective that might be different for younger people where liquidity is more
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.780]   important and things like a down payment cost a lot of money and a lot more than it did
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   years ago?
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.020]   Yeah, I've heard some of this too.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.860]   My colleague, Nick Majulia, writes this blog of dollars and data.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.820]   And he said, "Maxing your 401(k) is ridiculous when you're young."
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.820]   Because he compared, "What if you did an index fund portfolio in your brokerage account compared
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.460]   to the 401(k) and that tax deferral benefit?"
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.980]   And he ran the numbers and it's not as much as you would think.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.220]   That tax deferral, how much it really helps, especially if you're someone who is not making
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.820]   a lot of moves in your portfolio.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.820]   I do think that there's something to the constraint of having it in a retirement account and knowing
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.180]   that you have to pay a penalty if you take it out, in most cases, that it helps you think
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.180]   and act long term.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.700]   When I put money in my 401(k), it's just totally out of sight, out of mind to me.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.180]   And I know I'm not going to touch it for decades.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.820]   And that helps me plan around my other stuff.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.500]   So if I need liquidity, I plan around it.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.700]   I do think that a Roth IRA is probably your best option for this kind of stuff because
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.140]   you can take out your contributions, tax and penalty-free.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.980]   You can't take out any investment gains you make.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.540]   But those contributions make sense.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.500]   I really wish that they would just increase the limit on that to your 401(k) for people
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.260]   who don't have a 401(k) or a 401(k) at their job.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.260]   That makes sense to me.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.900]   But I can get behind that.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.380]   And I've had a lot of people in recent years ask, "Do you think it makes sense to cut back
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.980]   on my 401(k) to save for these other things, a wedding, a down payment, I have kids on
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   the way?"
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   And yeah, if you're...
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.380]   You have the foresight to save for those things and you're cutting back on your 401(k) a little
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.380]   bit.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.740]   The simplest advice is always get the match because you're turning down free money that
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740]   way.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.860]   But then if you have other things you're saving for, sure, especially with housing prices
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.380]   so much higher than they were, and the down payment may be having to be so much higher.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.380]   Yeah, sure.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.380]   I think it does make sense.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.220]   Especially if that's a much bigger priority than retiring in 4 decades or whatever.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.220]   I think the 2 big things.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.940]   If there's a match, I'm always an advocate of putting in whatever you need to get the
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   match.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.340]   But also, take a look.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.660]   I've looked at some 401(k)s that are just really expensive.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.780]   The funds that they force you to go in...
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.060]   I'll link in the show notes.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.060]   Maybe you know the site.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.740]   There's a site where you can put in your employer and they'll tell you how bad the fees are
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.380]   in your 401(k).
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.100]   And there are some places where it might actually be a worse decision financially.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.620]   If your 401(k) is at Vanguard, it's probably not that bad.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.560]   But there are a handful of companies where it's expensive.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.260]   So that's the only other big thing that I think about.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.320]   But I love it as a forced savings vehicle.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.360]   If you have the discipline to force yourself to save and not touch your money, then let
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.480]   yourself decide.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.240]   But definitely get the free match and look out for fees.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.320]   I do think that one of the things that's the greatest about having a 401(k) if you have
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.240]   it is just that that money comes out before you even see your paycheck at your bank account.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.320]   And you don't even think about the lost money that you have saving there.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.820]   I know it's only one extra step if you got paid and then you transferred it somewhere.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.600]   But just taking that step away for people, putting that barrier in place, I think is
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.880]   really helpful to a lot of people.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   They don't even think of that loss aversion of "Oh no, that $500 is gone forever now
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.820]   because I had to save it."
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.320]   It's out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   One thing...
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   It's kind of a hack, I guess.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.800]   If people don't know this, a lot of payroll providers will let you split your direct deposit.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.620]   And so let's say you're saving for a down payment and you want that same benefit.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.080]   You can go in, open up a savings account somewhere else, and take the routing number and the
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.160]   account number and go to log into ADP's website or whatever your payroll provider is.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.840]   And you can usually go add it.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.720]   And you can say, "I'm going to add this to my account and sweep $100 each paycheck so
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.040]   I don't have to see it."
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.560]   So there is the ability to automate that with most payroll providers, if you want that same
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   feeling.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.960]   My wife did this.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.360]   Our twins are 4 years old now.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.580]   When they were 1 year old, she's like, "Alright, when they turn 4 or 5, I want to bring them
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.580]   to Disney."
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   And so she turned it on.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.080]   She did $50 a month from her paycheck.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.240]   And this is going to be my Disney fund.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.040]   She's like, "I'm going to save for 3 years and we're actually going to Disney next week."
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.080]   And she saved for 3 years for this.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.880]   And 3 years later, $50 a month is paying for the majority of the trip.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.240]   And just because she did it in little drips and grabs and thought of it ahead of time.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.840]   But yeah, that just went to a straight online savings account.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.120]   Nothing fancy.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.080]   So we talked about investing in the long term and we've been dabbling a little bit in, "Okay,
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.680]   well, if it's for 3 years, online savings account.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   If it's a down payment."
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.440]   I know a question that you get on the podcast all the time.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.800]   And a question I get is, "What do you do with that short term money?"
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.880]   It used to be 2-3 years ago, it was like, "Well, high yield savings accounts are paying
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.320]   2+%."
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.960]   There's a lot of good options.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.920]   With interest rates so low, the average savings account right now is probably paying point
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   something percent.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.140]   It's probably low single digits percent depending on where it is.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.360]   Is there a good option that isn't as risky as the stock market?
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.280]   Is it really like a 2080 portfolio of stocks and bonds?
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.520]   Is it high yield crypto accounts?
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.480]   What do you think is a good place to put money that you don't need for 4 or 5 years?
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.760]   I wish I had a good answer for this.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.720]   In the low interest rate world, it's possible we might be in a low interest rate world for
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.600]   a long, long time too.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.840]   So I think this is something people might have to get used to.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.480]   I think my Marcus online savings account pays 50 basis points, right?
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   Half a percent.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.540]   I think the first question you have to ask yourself is, "If I'm going to stretch for
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.960]   yield in some way, whether that's investing in stocks, investing in a diversified portfolio..."
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.040]   By the way, I got an email from someone last week saying, "I put the entire down payment
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.880]   of my house into growth stocks."
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.720]   Not just like Apple and Amazon, but hyper growth stocks.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.400]   And they were like, "In 2020, I was a genius.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.640]   And now I don't know what I'm going to do."
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.760]   And so that's the downside here.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.880]   And I think especially...
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.440]   That's the extreme, of course.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   But think about...
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   Let's say you have $10,000.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.520]   And for every $10,000 you have, every extra 1% is $100 a year.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.320]   Now, $100 can be a lot of money for some people.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.840]   But I think you have to think through, "How much do I have in savings and how much is
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.680]   reaching for yield and putting that extra risk on going to actually matter?
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:46.480]   Is it going to make a difference in the down payment two or three years down the line?
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.120]   Or should I just play it safe and not worry about it?"
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.280]   I'm a play it safe kind of guy.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:56.400]   I know that there are people who have especially the stablecoin stuff at places like BlockFi
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.440]   and Gemini.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   And we've had the BlockFi CEO, Zach Prince, on our podcast a number of times.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.040]   And the way he says it is, "Listen, if I'm having this emergency fund that's actually
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.680]   for emergencies, I'm probably not going to put it in this stuff.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.840]   Because it is...
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.240]   You're not earning 7% or 8% for nothing.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.160]   There is some risk involved there.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.840]   And this is still a really new product.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   Right?
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.200]   Now, I personally have some money in there.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.760]   But again, that's not an emergency fund."
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.880]   And he said, "Listen, if you're saving for a boat, sure, I'd feel pretty comfortable
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   putting in there because it's not going to be the end of the world if something happens
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   to it.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.080]   But if it is an emergency or your down payment that you're going to need in 18 months, I
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   think you'd...
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   The regret...
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.680]   Again, the regret stuff, you'd much more regret not having enough for your down payment than
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.760]   you would making a little bit more and having a bigger down payment than you expected.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.080]   So I always err on the side of caution with that stuff.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.040]   Because I think the downside is way bigger than the upside."
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   And I would say, if you are thinking about where to put this stuff, it's not all or nothing.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.800]   You don't have to say, "I'm going to put all of it in a crypto savings account like BlockFi
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.000]   or all of it in Markus and get half a percent."
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.920]   You could say, "Well, I'm going to put 20% here and treat it as a blended rate.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.720]   You're going to get 88% on half of it and almost zero on the other.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.520]   It's more like a 4% return, but you're spreading the risk out."
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.960]   And that's effectively what I've done.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.880]   I would have kept all my money in the online savings account in the past.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.960]   That was for my liquid savings.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   And now I've spread it out to 2 or 3 different places.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.920]   And again, so I don't have that concentration risk if something should go wrong.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.880]   And then I think you spread your bets that way.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.000]   That makes sense.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.200]   For me, I think the cash that I hold for the short term doesn't necessarily have a purpose.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.440]   It's kind of like, I just want some there.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.240]   If the economy takes a downturn in 2020, I was glad I had a little cash on the sidelines
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.400]   when the market was down 20% or 30%.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.800]   So I don't have a specific purpose.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.440]   So I'm probably a little bit more comfortable with risk.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.920]   So I think I have the majority of it earning 8% or 9%.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.880]   But for something like emergencies, I keep a healthy cash buffer that earns nothing in
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.240]   a checking or a savings account that I just want to make sure is always there no matter
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.440]   what that has the liquidity of I can wire it out somewhere tomorrow or withdraw it at
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   an ATM today.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.000]   And I don't have to wait a day or two to transfer it from something.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.600]   And that decision probably depends as much on your investor risk profile as on your circumstances
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   in life.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.040]   I think I have kids now.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   I have 3 kids.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.760]   And so if I was single, I'd probably think about this and come at it a different way
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.880]   than if I had kids because it changes the way that you view risk.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.320]   So I think that is part of it too.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   What else do you have to potentially prepare for in terms of those downsides?
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320]   I'm like you.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.680]   I have liquid cash savings.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.560]   I don't have it earmarked for anything.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.120]   I have buckets where I...
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.920]   This is our vacation fund and this is for...
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.120]   I have some of those things, but then I have this cash that's just there just in case.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.720]   Like break if necessary.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.800]   Or if you find a opportunity, my old co-founder called it his elephant hunting fund.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.400]   And it was like, "I have this money sitting here in case some big opportunity comes across
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.560]   my way and I don't want to miss out on it."
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.920]   And he was like, "That could be a unique investment.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.000]   That could be a down payment on a house.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.400]   It could be something...
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   The market crashes."
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.920]   And he's like, "I'm willing to give up the return on this because it's for an opportunity
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.720]   in the future that I hope will outperform the 2% or 3%."
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.320]   I have a home equity line of credit for the same reason.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.480]   We took out a home equity line of credit because we bought our house in 2017 and housing prices
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.680]   are up, I don't know, 40% or 50% where we live.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.560]   And I have all this equity sitting there and we paid down the house a little bit and mortgage
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   rates are low.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   And so we've opened up a decent-sized home equity line of credit for as much as they
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.800]   would give us.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.240]   And that is my other fallback for this kind of thing, where if I really need to write
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.360]   a big check for some reason, and I don't have to shuffle around all my other finances, this
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.560]   is another financial backstop for me that I can use.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.680]   And especially since rates are so low, it's also not a bad way of using debt when you're
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   borrowing at your house.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.600]   And you could do the same thing with your portfolio at pretty low interest rates.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.640]   I've written in my newsletter in the past about some of the risks that borrowing comes
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   with.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.320]   Things like getting a margin call if the market crashes.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.240]   So I try to keep that to a percent that won't end up in any of those circumstances.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.480]   At Wealthfront, we cap the portfolio borrowing at 30%.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.920]   And I don't think we've ever had to make a margin call because we've set it up in a way
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.600]   that it can withhold the kind of market drops that we expect in the worst-case scenarios
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.220]   or at least the almost worst-case scenario.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.160]   That's the other side of this low rates thing.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.480]   People are earning really low rates on their savings.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.680]   But the other side of that is low rates on your debt.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.440]   So right, you talk about using margin in a reasonable way.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.320]   That's something that in the past would have seen, "No.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   Why would you ever do that?
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   That sounds stupid."
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.160]   But if you're using it just for a portion of your portfolio, you set up 20% or 30% maybe
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   10%.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.320]   With rates so low, that equation kind of changes.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.440]   And in the past, I would have been one who probably would have said, "I'm going to pay
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   my house off."
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.400]   And in fact, the first house that my wife and I bought, we refinanced like three times
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.680]   because our initial rate was like 6.5%.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.320]   And then we're down to in the threes.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.600]   And we were making the same payment and it was effectively a double payment.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.840]   And now that rates are so much lower, I think, "Why did I pay that off so much faster?
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.280]   I'm in no hurry to pay off my debt."
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.480]   And I know some people just they have this burning desire inside them like, "I have to
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   pay off all debts."
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.040]   But for me, where the rates are, that's the other side of the...
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.360]   I'm not earning a lot of my savings, but my debt is not costing me much either.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.200]   So I'm actually more comfortable using it a little bit in a reasonable manner.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   So here's a question.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.000]   I get a lot from listeners and you probably have too.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.560]   If I'm out there and I want to buy a million-dollar house, it is totally reasonable for me to
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.720]   put down $250,000 and buy a million-dollar house.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.720]   But it seems so unreasonable for me to use leverage in investing in the market.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:39.160]   And I know there are some reasons like margin calls and variable interest rates.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:45.240]   But used responsibly, what opinion do you have on leverage in investing?
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.320]   Taking 30% or taking your home equity line and investing in the market, which in the
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:56.040]   long run has returned greater than the 1% or 2% that you're probably paying to borrow?
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.120]   I'll tell you what.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:02.320]   When the market was down 35% in March 2020, I was trying to get my home equity line of
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.280]   credit through so fast, so I could take out of it and put it in the market.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.040]   Now, that was during a crash situation, not now.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.720]   But I do think if you're doing it in a reasonable manner and you understand the potential downsides...
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.440]   And the great thing is, if you're borrowing at your home, again, not everyone has this
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.480]   opportunity if they don't own a home or they don't have enough equity.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.840]   But you have like a 10-year period to use a home equity line of credit in most instances.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.360]   Then you have 15 years to pay it off.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.280]   So it's not like you're going to get a margin call on that home equity line of credit, right?
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.880]   If you used it, it's not like it's going to become right for you.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.720]   If you borrow against your portfolio, that could be different.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.560]   But yeah, if you're doing it...
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.080]   If you have some sort of cap in mind, like, "I'm borrowing at $3 and I'm going to get
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   $8."
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.680]   As long as you don't need that money for something else, and you understand any potential...
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.000]   The biggest downside, obviously, is, "Well, the stock market falls 70% like a Great Depression
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.280]   and then I'm screwed."
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.720]   I guess if that happens, we have bigger problems on our hands.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.640]   But I do think if you thought through it all, it's not the worst idea in the world if you
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.080]   can do it in a reasonable manner.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.400]   I would just say, make sure you have the horizons in mind, right?
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:07.560]   The stock market, historically, has returned much greater than the 1% or 2% or 3% interest
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.360]   rates you're paying right now.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   However, the stock market has not performed greater than 1%, 2%, or 3% every single year.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:20.360]   And so, it's probably not a safe bet to make it for a one-year bet, but it could be a safer
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.600]   long-term bet.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.000]   Or at least, as a long-term bet, it might be safer than a short-term bet, I guess.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.640]   It's never safe because we never know what's going to happen.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.000]   But I will say one hack in here is that when you borrow money to invest, the interest you
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.360]   pay on that money is often deductible against the gains you have as investment interest
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   expense.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.920]   Depending on your tax rate, depending on a lot of circumstances, you might be paying
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.480]   2.5% to borrow money.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.080]   But if you invest that money and you have enough gains, dividends, interest to use it
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.480]   to deduct, that interest rate could cut as high as half off depending on your tax bracket
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   and what state you live in.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.440]   And again, I think where we are in the interest rate cycle has so much more to it.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.000]   This would seem antithetical to personal finance people to say 10 years ago, "You'd be nuts
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   to...
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.600]   Why would you borrow against your portfolio or invest more from borrowed money?"
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.000]   But where rates are today, I think it's something that makes more sense than it did in the past.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.240]   And another piece of rates that I think is similar that you mentioned earlier is inflation.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.120]   All I hear about from everyone right now is, "What's going on?"
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.920]   You guys have talked a lot about it on the show and have greater opinions than I do.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.000]   Obviously, no one can predict what's happening.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.080]   But what's your thought on what's happening with inflation and rates outlook for 2022?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.440]   I think the craziest thing is that just...
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.720]   We've never gone through anything like this.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.040]   It's been 4 decades.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.660]   I was born in 1981.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.000]   That's basically the last time we had inflation this high.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   So you have...
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.280]   I know people always say, "Oh, if you just started investing in 2020, you've never experienced
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   A, B, or C."
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.400]   But unless you've been in this game for 3 or 4 decades, you really haven't experienced
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.920]   any inflation this high.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:58.240]   I think from 2008 to 2020, inflation was like 1.6% per year.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.480]   Now it's 7%.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.980]   And we've had higher economic growth because of that and all this other stuff going on.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.760]   But I think that trying to come up with a short-term hedge to beat it in your investment
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.600]   portfolio is really difficult.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.240]   I'm going to own gold or gold miners or commodities or whatever it is.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.640]   And not thinking through how much of that is priced in and how much inflation needs
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.920]   to hire for some of those things.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.440]   I still think that the stock market is probably your best bet for long-term inflation.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:29.520]   So in that same period from 2008 to 2020, the S&P 500 was up well over 10% per year,
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.120]   even with 2008 getting crushed and inflation was much lower.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.200]   So that's why holding stocks over the long run is a good inflation hedges because you
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.680]   make up for it in those years when inflation isn't high.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.440]   So your real returns there were way above average.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.840]   So I think that's why holding stocks over the long run makes so much sense is because
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.520]   your real returns when inflation is low, help make up for that what happens when inflation
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.240]   is higher and your real returns are lower.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.400]   So the stat I always give is that over the last 100 years, the dividend payout on the
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.480]   S&P 500, the US stock market, has gone up at 2% above the rate of inflation.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.520]   So you think, "Oh, I'm earning 1.7% in dividends on the S&P 500."
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   That's nothing.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   It sounds paltry.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.480]   But that dividend is growing every single year and it's because corporations are earning
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:19.960]   more and growing and innovating, they're paying out above the rate of inflation over the long
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960]   term as well.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.680]   And so that income is a growing stream of income.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.400]   That's why I still think that the stock market over the long run is by far your best hedge
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.280]   against inflation.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.480]   And for cash, it's kind of tips beat a savings account these days.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.360]   And for anyone not listening, the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are government-issued
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:43.260]   bonds or securities that you can invest in that beat inflation or that's the goal?
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.400]   It's actually almost an alternative investment.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.080]   It's only been around in the US since the mid-90s.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.180]   And effectively, what it does is it builds in the expected inflation.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:59.020]   So it gives you a yield that is the Treasury bond minus what the market thinks inflation
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.220]   is going to be.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.980]   So your yield when you buy it is effectively negative.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.940]   And then you add on inflation to it.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.360]   And so what it does is it gives you a one-for-one inflation, which is why the returns there
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.480]   were so high last year.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.800]   You earned like 5% in tips last year, where if you invested in a total bond market fund,
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.120]   you were down like 2% because that's a 7% difference in inflation.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.680]   So you get a one-for-one inflation kicker.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   And where you really get the returns from there is if you get unexpectedly high inflation.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.780]   Because again, the expected inflation is built in.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.760]   So I think that is actually one of the...
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.780]   Yeah, maybe that's something we should have mentioned for a short-term vehicle is investing
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.640]   in inflation-protected securities.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.960]   Because that is in the short term, a big problem is that cash is earning nothing and it's getting
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.840]   eaten away from inflation on a real basis.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:46.480]   So yeah, those tips actually make a lot of sense in the short run, because that's the
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.160]   one thing you can invest in.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.840]   You could say, "I want to invest in gold and all these other things."
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.720]   And even people said, "Well, Bitcoin is an inflation hedge."
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.060]   But these things don't move one-to-one with the inflation rate, because people are putting
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.400]   their expectations in on them and telling stories.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:03.240]   Whereas tips give you that one-to-one hedge, where you're going to get exactly what the
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.360]   inflation is as your return, basically.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.520]   And they're not things where you have to go buy a bond from the government.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   They're ETFs.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.480]   I think it's just tips as the ticker.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   You could just buy ETFs.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   Low-cost ETF.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   So if you're thinking about how do you do this, for anyone who's ever bought a government
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   bond from...
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.760]   I can't remember the site and it feels old school and complicated.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.760]   This is easier.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   There's just an ETF for it.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.160]   But my one thing about inflation is that it's really, really difficult to hedge.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.600]   So last year, you had the greatest setup for gold ever.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   You had...
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.320]   The government was printing tons of money.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   We finally had inflation.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.920]   It was 7%.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.480]   But gold was down like 5% or 6% on the year.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.120]   And for years, people are saying, "Buy gold because the Fed's printing money.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.920]   The government's spending too much.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.640]   Debt is at an all-time high."
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.400]   And gold drops in the year that all this stuff finally comes to a crescendo.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.080]   And that's why the markets are so difficult to manage and try to get.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.320]   So that's why I think you can get too cute with these things and try to outthink things.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.600]   Or you could invest in tips and understand, "I have a one-for-one.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.800]   I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   That's the hedge."
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.040]   Yep.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.080]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.880]   And Trade Coffee is a great addition to your New Year routine.

[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:05.080]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:14.960]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans, allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.820]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.200]   cooking at home?
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.540]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.840]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.820]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.640]   from AnyDay, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.440]   AnyDay is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.800]   microwave and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.400]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:54.920]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.680]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.200]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your AnyDay adventure, I highly recommend
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.840]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.040]   It is so good.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.520]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year,
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.260]   you have to check it out.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.800]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.

[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.920]   So I'm sure we left off a lot of stuff.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.960]   I'm sure there are people with questions.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.720]   Definitely send them in, chris@allthehacks.com if you have them.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.880]   Maybe we'll do this again.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.680]   I want to jump outside of investing a little bit and talk about a few things.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.080]   One is just ways to simplify your finances.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.480]   And investing is a part of that.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.800]   But I know you've had a lot of thoughts there.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.360]   You have your own hacks to make things easier.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.120]   I'd love to hear what you've got.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.840]   My simplest hack, honestly, is just being optimistic about the future when it comes
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   to finances.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.280]   I think if you're one of these people that is always just down on the economy, the markets,
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.640]   what's the point of investing in the first place?
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   So that's one thing.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.880]   I think if you're going to invest, the whole point of investing is that the future is going
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.040]   to be better than today.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.240]   Otherwise, why invest your money?
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.480]   So that's where I start.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.680]   I think the rules-based thing applies to a lot of things.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.160]   So obviously, automated saving, automated investing, rebalancing.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.520]   I also think bill pay, all these things that a lot of people have mentioned before.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.320]   One of the things I've done in recent years that I don't know why I didn't do before,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.080]   but automated giving to charities.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.160]   So on a monthly basis, anytime I find this good...
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.800]   In the past, around the holidays, or there was something going on, there was some catastrophic
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.680]   event, then I'd give some money and I'd do it in dribs and drabs.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.100]   Now I automate that.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.960]   And I've actually gotten letters from these charities saying, "Thank you.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   We appreciate that.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.920]   Because we know we're getting your monthly amount each month.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.080]   That actually helps us plan out our finances for you.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.200]   Obviously, it's not just me, but it's everyone."
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.080]   And so actually, giving to these charities on a monthly basis, like you do with your
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.480]   savings automatically, and they almost all have an option for that now.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.080]   You check a box saying, "I'm going to give $25, $50, $100 a month to this charity."
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.440]   And that's actually a really good thing for them for their planning purposes.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.800]   I'll just chime in for a sec.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.440]   There's a company I've mentioned in the past, or at least in my newsletter called Daffy,
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.940]   which is a donor-advised fund.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.440]   It's a new app.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.240]   And it's interesting because it disintermediates...
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.200]   So donor-advised funds have historically been this thing, "Oh, here's an opportunity for
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:37.240]   people who are in really high tax years to donate a lot in one year, and then be able
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.960]   to give over a series of years."
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.160]   So it's been a great thing for people who are, "Oh man, my company got acquired.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.060]   I got some inheritance in that high tax year."
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.780]   You can actually donate money to a fund that you manage.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:53.060]   And then anytime in the future, you can donate money from that fund to a charity and you
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.660]   get the entire tax write-off at the beginning.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:01.760]   And if you donate appreciated stock, you can often get it even multiplies the tax benefit.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.820]   But the cool thing they've added is the ability to set up recurring donations.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:11.040]   And so I like that there's a disintermediation from, "I want to give and I know where I want
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.040]   to give."
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.400]   And so every now and then there's a thing where, "Oh, I want to give to this cause."
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.040]   I don't always, like it sounds like you do, have the same cause every time.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.200]   It might change on the circumstance, what's happening in the world.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:27.580]   And so you can actually set up automated giving and say, "I'm going to give $100 a month and
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.380]   not know where it's going to go."
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.200]   And then while that money is sitting there, you can actually invest it.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.580]   So they even have a portfolio with a little bit of crypto.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.260]   So I was like, "Oh, let's take a little bit of risk here."
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.780]   And so that's something I've started doing.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.900]   All the donations I make, I make them to Daffy.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.100]   I keep it all managed there.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.100]   I let it grow with the market.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.980]   And then when I'm ready to donate it, I could do that whenever I want.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.740]   And my wife and I both log into the app and she's like, "Oh, I'm going to send money to
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:49.980]   this thing right away."
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.820]   And Daffy didn't pay me to say any of this.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:56.000]   But if you do want to check them out, I'd definitely love you to use my referral code.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.260]   It gets you $25 for free.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.540]   It's at allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:06.240]   And the only downside is, I wish there was a way to use something like that with some
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.720]   of the online fundraisers.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.580]   Because I always feel like the worst person saying, "Oh, you're raising money for this
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.020]   cause for your birthday."
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.980]   I was like, "I just sent a check to the cause on your behalf."
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.460]   And then they're like, "Yeah, but the meter didn't go up."
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   And I was like, "I know.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.460]   I did send it."
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.460]   I was like, "No.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.460]   That the money's there.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.460]   I'm really sorry.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.460]   The meter didn't go up."
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.700]   I think that that's something I've changed my tune on.
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.980]   So I mentioned asset allocation and how important that is for investing.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.620]   I like the idea of having a savings allocation too.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:35.980]   So let's say you get a bonus at work, or I don't know if you had an inheritance or a
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.500]   check for Christmas or something.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.500]   I don't know.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.500]   Whatever it is.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.620]   You get a chunk of money that you didn't expect you were going to get, or it's just outside
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:43.980]   of your regular income.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.700]   I like having an idea percentage-wise of how I'm going to save that money.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:48.900]   So you don't just blow it on something.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.540]   So I have a percentage that's going to go into retirement funds.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:54.620]   I have a percentage that's going to go to brokerage, savings, maybe vacation.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.940]   And then I always leave 20% to 30% where I'm just going to blow it on something.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.180]   And I think it's important to have that in Scratch that is because I talk about all this
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.140]   stuff about saving and investing and being rules-based.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:10.340]   But I think this is, again, since I've had my kids, something I've really come on, changed
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:15.700]   my mind on is like, it's okay to spend money and have fun and do things for yourself and
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.300]   not just save everything.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:21.900]   So I think it's important to have that piece of your budget or your whatever it is, your
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:27.300]   money that is going to just be there to have fun and blow in a guilt-free way where you
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.180]   don't have to worry about it.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.560]   And you don't have to think every single decision you're making, let's just have a little fun
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.180]   with this money, whatever it is.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.420]   And it depends on the person what it's going to be.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.340]   But I have that piece too, where it's just, I'm just going to spend this, I'm going to
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:42.140]   blow it, and I'm not going to obsess over it.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.220]   Are there some things you've spent that money on that you'll share that are like, just God
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:46.340]   made you feel so good?
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:50.580]   I think any sort of thing with my kids, like I'm never going...
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.720]   Here's a little one that my daughter is seven and she's getting into reading.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.860]   So this is kind of a dumb one.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.580]   But I told her, "Anytime you want to buy a book from Amazon, I'm never going to say no.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.580]   If you're going to read this..."
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.580]   She reads every night.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.540]   I don't know how she got into this habit.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.940]   And I told her, "Other stuff we're going to have discussions on.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.660]   But if you want to buy a book, and I'm going to see that you're reading them, I will buy
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.980]   you a book anytime you want.
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.700]   That's like, I'm not going to think about it."
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.860]   So just little, I think little things like that help.
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.860]   And then other things, like I said, like family vacations and things like that stuff.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:23.280]   I think those creating those memories and experiences are always going to be useful.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.780]   Even though my wife is much more of a Disney person than me, like my kids are so excited
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:27.780]   to do this.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:31.220]   And my wife wanted to stay at like the nice hotel right by that's really close to the
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.220]   parks.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.820]   And in the past, I would have felt, "Well, why don't we stay at the cheaper one further
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:35.820]   away?"
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.960]   But I know this is going to be fun for the kids because there's a pool and stuff there
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   and all this stuff.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.520]   And that's the kind of thing where I'm not going to lose sleep over the fact that we're
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.660]   spending a little more on this vacation because like the memories and experience is going
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.660]   to be...
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:47.660]   That's going to stay with us for a long time.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:48.660]   Awesome.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:49.660]   I'm excited.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:53.180]   My daughter's too young to really appreciate Disney, but I know that's in our future.
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.180]   It's honestly not cheap.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.220]   And everyone says once you get there, they put this wristband on you that's attached
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.220]   to your credit card.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:03.220]   And every time you want to spend money, all they do is have to swipe your wristband and
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.620]   it charges to your room.
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:08.060]   And I know it's a lot of money, but yeah, I think for the experience, it's totally worth
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.060]   it.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.060]   Any other hacks?
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.440]   I think the simplest one that I always tell people, especially young people, and I wrote
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:18.160]   this in my book for people who, let's say you're 40 or 50 years old and you're behind
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.520]   on retirement savings and you think, "All right, I'm going to become the next Warren
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.440]   Buffett and I'm going to shoot the moon and my stock picks or my investment prowess is
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.680]   going to propel my portfolio and I'm going to be fine in retirement."
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.140]   This is in my retirement book.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:35.720]   And I said, "Let's say I use a simple round number like $100,000 household income.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.680]   You save 10% of it and you could earn 6% a year in the market.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.500]   What happens after 10 and 20 years?"
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:45.380]   And then I said, "Okay, what happens if instead of earning 6%, you're able to earn 12%?"
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.380]   You double it up, right?
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.440]   You're this great investor, same savings rate, you double it up, obviously your money is
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.440]   going to be much higher.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.760]   But now let's go the other way and say instead of saving 10%, you double your savings rate
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.400]   and save 20, but your return stays at 6, right?
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   You're not Warren Buffett.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   You can't double up the market.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.520]   You only return 6%.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.020]   Your return is actually higher from doubling your savings rate over 10 and 20 years than
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.520]   it is from doubling your investment return.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.840]   And doubling your investment return is way harder for most people than it is to double
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   your savings rate.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.120]   Because as we talked about, beating the market and picking stocks and these things is very,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   very difficult.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.640]   And that's promised to no one.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.840]   But most people can probably figure out ways to save more money.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.400]   So I always tell people, especially when you're young, that saving is way, way more important
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.960]   than investing, even though investing is way sexier.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.000]   And it's funny, when you go from 10 to 20, it's a huge leap.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.080]   But I always tell people, you could probably go from 10 to 11.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.120]   You could probably go from 10 to 10 and a half.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.840]   And if you make those adjustments over time, most people end up...
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.260]   Their budget just fills the gap.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.080]   And obviously, if you try to take out 10%, it might be a little bit rocky.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.760]   But if you try to take out 1% or 2% and just slowly add on to that, you become comfortable
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760]   with it.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.440]   And also, anytime you get a raise, maybe just sweep the raise into that process.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.680]   If you want to get to 20 and you get a 3% raise, just take 3% right away.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.760]   You already know you can live without the raise.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.760]   Maybe take... To your advice, maybe take 2% and then put 1% in a fun fund so that you
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.960]   can go and spend some money and enjoy the fact that you worked hard.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   You got a raise.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.960]   The stair-step approach.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.460]   When I first started out of college, I was making nothing.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.460]   I think the most I could save in my boring target day fund was like $50 a month.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.220]   But then every year, I would bump it up a little bit more and maybe save half or three
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.200]   quarters of my raise and slowly got to that place where I wanted to get...
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.140]   But like you said, if you're ripping the bandaid off and going from 10% to 20%, most people
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.060]   can't realistically do that.
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.260]   But you can do a slow stair-step approach where you increase the percentage of the amount
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.380]   a little bit every year and get to that goal.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.380]   Okay.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:46.780]   Last thing before we head out, I would love to hear... You read a lot, you follow a lot
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.500]   of sub stacks, you follow a lot of people on Twitter.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.780]   You stay on top of the market better than me.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.420]   Are there a few people that you enjoy reading from or following that people listening might
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.340]   want to check out if they want to stay on top of things?
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.340]   Other than you, of course.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.540]   I came up before the whole podcast, YouTube blog thing, I was actually talking to a college
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.540]   class recently.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.880]   And I was asking them because they all seemed way smarter about the markets than I ever
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880]   was at that age.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.160]   I knew absolutely nothing.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.300]   When I graduated in 2004 or whatever it is, I came out with very little knowledge.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:21.700]   And the resources today are so much more easily accessible to people, especially young people.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.900]   They're watching the YouTube videos and following the podcast and stuff.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.460]   Learned a lot of my stuff that I...
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.320]   My way to catch up on my lack of knowledge was just reading books.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.540]   I think anything written by William Bernstein is my favorite investment writer of all time.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:38.180]   So probably his best well known is the Four Pillars of Investing, which is from the early
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.180]   2000s.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.180]   But he wrote one after the 2008 crash called The Investor's Manifesto.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.540]   He was a former brain surgeon who turned investment advisor, and it's probably one of the smartest
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.540]   people I know.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.900]   So anything by William Bernstein is very good.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.060]   There's also this book called, and I'm looking for some underrated ones here, not the ones
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.420]   that you can just Google and say, "What are the best investing books?"
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:59.200]   But I learned losing a million dollars by the story about this guy, Jim Paul.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.840]   Have you heard of this one before?
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840]   No.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.400]   He was a commodities trader in the 1980s.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.360]   And he talked about being this young hot shot commodities trader who made a ton of money,
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.480]   had no idea what he was doing.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.960]   He made all this money and he talked about how it messed with his head.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.960]   And he thought all the profits he was making were because he was so smart and successful.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.660]   And then when he lost it all, he realized, "Oh, wait.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.660]   I was actually just an idiot.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   I didn't know anything.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.660]   I got lucky."
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:28.560]   So it's his emotional journey of going from this young guy who became this hot shot commodities
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.460]   trader and then losing all the money and what happened and his journey of figuring out what
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:38.700]   that all meant and how you shouldn't personalize successes and how much luck is involved.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.460]   And how just because you make money doesn't mean you made a right decision.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.100]   And just because you lose money didn't mean you make the wrong decision.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.900]   Sometimes it's just the fate of the market.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:49.380]   So that's actually one of my favorite investing books that I've ever read about the psychology
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.500]   behind it.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.500]   I love that.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.780]   And I love benchmarking yourself.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.060]   I think in 2020, so many people were like, "Oh, I made so much money in the market."
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   Or 2021 also.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:01.060]   And I'm like, "Okay, but how did that compare to the market?"
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:05.380]   Because you can look like you got a 20% return but if the market went up 20%, then you just
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.700]   got the market return.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:12.060]   And so I think that's a lesson that takes more than a couple minutes to process.
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.020]   But sounds like he learned that also.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.500]   So I'll check that out.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.400]   Anything that you use day-to-day, week-to-week?
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.820]   What's your go-to source of market news?
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.980]   Honestly, for me, I've curated a list of people to follow on Twitter.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.500]   And I know like social media, there's a lot of bad things about it.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.300]   But I think if you have the right filters in place, and can figure out to follow the
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.620]   right people to pay attention to this stuff, and just filter out the people who are just
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.620]   going to waste your time.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.180]   I think there's actually a lot of signal there as opposed to noise if you follow the right
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.180]   people.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.460]   So I guess if you're listening, just check out who Ben follows.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.460]   And that's a good list.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.460]   There you go.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.460]   Look at my follower list.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:49.460]   Awesome.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.460]   And perfect time.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.460]   What's the easiest thing you're doing?
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.460]   Podcast, book, writing, everything.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.060]   Yeah, it's probably easiest just to check out my website, A Wealth of Common Sense.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.100]   I've been doing that for going on 9 or 10 years now.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.220]   I write everything there and put all the podcasts up there so that you can find me.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.220]   Awesome.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.860]   I'll link to all that in the show notes.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.140]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:08.140]   Awesome.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   This was fun.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.900]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.140]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:18.380]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:24.260]   I would really appreciate it, especially Spotify since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.980]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.480]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   That's it for this week.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:43.380]   I'll see you next week.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.960]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.780]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:56.100]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:00.440]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.980]   to save a dollar.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.920]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.100]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:16.300]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:21.660]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:26.620]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.620]   plan.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.040]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.780]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.440]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.300]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.420]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.860]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.580]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
