[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160]   Well, God can prevent every trial from entering our lives.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.860]   He can, and he doesn't.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620]   Why not?
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.340]   That's the question that every believer
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.520]   must eventually answer,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.540]   especially if you believe that God is all powerful.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.720]   If God is all powerful,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.400]   why does he allow trials into our lives?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.820]   Why does he let the car break down
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.620]   in the middle of nowhere?
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.480]   To that end, we have a fascinating clip
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.880]   to address this very point,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.400]   a clip from a 1996 sermon that marked
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.080]   the 125th anniversary of Bethlehem Baptist Church.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.040]   Pastor John was preaching Jeremiah 32, verses 36 to 42.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.520]   And to introduce the text,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.900]   he shared a poem and a personal story.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.740]   Have a listen.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.300]   Our aim is to celebrate the sustaining grace of God
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.720]   for 125 years.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.000]   And my first question is, what is that?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   What is sustaining grace?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.440]   And I want to put it in a four line poem
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.540]   that I took about an hour to figure out yesterday.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.420]   And I'm going to say it over and over again,
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.560]   because when I take the time to put things in a rhyme
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.620]   that is true, it just helps me, helps me.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.080]   So you have to tolerate this.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.160]   What is sustaining grace?
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   Not grace to bar what is not bliss,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.220]   nor flight from all distress, but this.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.320]   The grace that orders our trouble and pain,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.360]   and then in the darkness is there to sustain.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.920]   Now, the reason I stress this is because
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.900]   if we were to celebrate a grace this morning
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900]   that bars us from what is not bliss,
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.960]   and that gives flight from all distress,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.980]   and that does not order our pain,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.980]   it would be biblically false and experientially unrealistic.
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.780]   Our experience and the Bible teaches us
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.780]   that grace does not prevent pain,
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.620]   but orders it, arranges it, measures it out,
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.480]   and then in the darkness of it sustains us.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.560]   For example, yesterday, Bob Ricker,
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.100]   I'm going to borrow your story.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.220]   You go to him and get it corrected afterwards
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.100]   if I've missed anything.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.700]   He told us in that other room over there
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.780]   that God ordains that the people of the Lord
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.140]   from time to time take stones and make memorials out of them
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.060]   so that when they look at them and children say,
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.940]   "What's that?"
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.980]   Parents and others can say, "That's because God did that."
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.020]   And then he told the story of a little less
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.940]   than 10 years ago, their daughter was
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.160]   in a very serious automobile accident,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.180]   so serious that she would have died,
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.180]   but the car behind, providentially, had a doctor in it.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.660]   The doctor providentially had in his pocket an air tube.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.160]   He also had the presence of mind and got to her
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.880]   just as she was turning blue to force this
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.900]   into her throat and she lived.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.700]   And he did her wedding here, a couple of,
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.140]   it was 892, I think you said.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.740]   And as he looked at her doing the wedding as the pastor
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.100]   and saw these little scars that remain,
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.100]   he said to her, "Those are a memorial of sustaining grace."
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.900]   Now, Bob Ricker is not naive.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.820]   He knows that if God can manage a doctor in the car behind,
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.900]   and if God can manage a little air tube in his pocket,
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.460]   if God can manage to put him on the scene
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.740]   with the presence of mind and the saving action
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.420]   to save her life, he could have stopped the accident
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.620]   in the first place.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.340]   Not grace to bar what is not bliss,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.920]   nor flight from all distress, but this,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.060]   the grace that orders our trouble and pain
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.780]   and then in the darkness is there to sustain.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.580]   Another story, a little lighter this time.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.580]   Noel, Abraham, Barnabas and Talitha are in the car
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.380]   two Saturdays ago, driving from here to Georgia.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.820]   The car breaks down three times
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.780]   and daddy is at home comfortable.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.840]   The third time it broke down was about an hour outside
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   of Indianapolis on a lonely stretch Saturday afternoon.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.660]   And the radiator crumbles to pieces basically.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.900]   Car overheats, they're off on the side of the road,
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.820]   baby, two kids, wife and no daddy.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.980]   What do you do on Saturday afternoon?
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.180]   A farmer stops, 67 year old farmer,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.700]   and says, "Can I help?"
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.000]   And Noel says, "Well, we just need a motel."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.780]   And a Monday morning with a garage somewhere, where are we?
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.300]   And he says, "Well, would you be willing
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.040]   "to come stay with us, my wife and me?"
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.980]   Pause.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:56.380]   Well, I'm not sure we would wanna impose.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.660]   And he says, "You know, the Lord says
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.700]   "that when you serve people in need,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.420]   "it's like serving the Lord."
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.860]   And she says, "Well, can we go to church
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.260]   "with you tomorrow morning?"
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.840]   And he says, "Can you take a Baptist church?"
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:29.180]   Not only is he a farmer, he is a retired aviation mechanic.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.460]   And he sets them up.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.360]   Monday morning, he drives to Indianapolis at 6 a.m.,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.180]   buys the radiator, puts it in,
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.300]   will not charge her for the labor.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.460]   And they're on their way mid-morning on Saturday.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.660]   And the icing on the cake is that he has a pond on his farm
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.060]   and Abraham catches a 19 inch catfish.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.460]   Now, if God can manage a farmer on the scene
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.880]   who happens to be a Christian and a Baptist to boot,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.180]   and an aviation mechanic and an open home
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.220]   and a heart for the hurting and a fish pond,
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.220]   he could have saved the radiator.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.340]   And he didn't because sustaining grace
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.700]   is not grace to bar what is not bliss
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.300]   nor flight from all distress, but this,
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.500]   the grace that orders our troubles and pain
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.400]   and then in the darkness is there to sustain.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.260]   Amen.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.020]   Can you take a Baptist church?
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.220]   That's so good.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.620]   This clip was taken from the very start
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.940]   of John Piper's June 16, 1996 sermon
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.280]   titled "Sustained by Sovereign Grace Forever."
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.200]   You can find it online at desiringgod.org.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.060]   The clip was emailed to me by Brian,
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.540]   a pastor in Minden, Nevada.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.060]   He writes, "I started listening to Pastor John's sermons
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.540]   "in seminary in 1990 and 1991.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.940]   "The Nelsons, a faithful couple at Bethlehem,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.380]   "made the sermon tapes from cassettes bought in bulk
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.640]   "from Sam's Club.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.420]   "When I moved to Nevada to plant the church,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.480]   "I kept getting the sermon cassettes in the mail.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.080]   "This particular sermon from 1996 made such an impact on me.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.160]   "Pastor John's story about God's providence
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.820]   "gave me an example for me to give to my own kids
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.620]   "when we encountered trials.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.160]   "The first occasion was a short period after the sermon,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.220]   "I hit a deer outside of Augusta, Georgia
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.100]   "and totaled a car.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.580]   "I asked my kids after it was all over,
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.540]   "couldn't God have just kept the deer out of the road?
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.860]   "Yes, he could have, but not grace to bar
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.740]   "what is not bliss nor flight from all distress,
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.500]   "but this, the grace that orders our trouble and pain
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.980]   "and then in the darkness is there to sustain."
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.140]   Wow, Brad, thanks for pointing all of us
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.800]   to this great clip.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.380]   If you have a clip that would bless others,
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.880]   email me, give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.860]   timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.140]   and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.900]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email,
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.140]   send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.360]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.180]   Well, how progressive can a progressive Christian get?
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.980]   And at what point does a progressive Christian
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.700]   progress to the point of no longer
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.560]   being a Christian at all?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.640]   That's a deep question that needs to be answered
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.920]   in a day like ours when biblical revelation
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.220]   is taken too lightly.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.940]   To that question, we go next time with Pastor John
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.060]   back in the studio with me on Friday.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.020]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:05.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
