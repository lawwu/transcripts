[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:12.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.880]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.320]   This is our show where we answer questions
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.200]   straight from you, the viewer.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   Our inbox is filling up.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.080]   Duncan and I were talking before we got on here.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.800]   Instead of people giving us their height and their weight
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.600]   when they email us and now they give us their salary,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.560]   their asset allocation, their stock picks, all this stuff.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.720]   It's great, we love the fact that you guys
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   are sharing so much information with us.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.400]   Remember, if you have a question,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.040]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.000]   Duncan, I have one question for you.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.160]   Is my sweater too hot for the YouTube algorithm?
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.480]   Is this pink too bright?
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.320]   - It could be.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.560]   It might be an actual out of gamut color.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.840]   - I didn't use my color thing today.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   All right, what do we got?
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.840]   Let's do question number one.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.240]   - Okay, so up first we've got one
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.000]   I think a lot of people will be able to relate to.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.200]   So you've shown time and again that owning the market
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.120]   is a better strategy than picking individual names.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.960]   However, for people who enjoy the market
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.600]   and want to have some fun on Robinhood,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.960]   what advice do you have for someone
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.880]   who's found themselves down 26%, now actually 28%,
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.480]   and 34% in their two biggest holdings,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.000]   I may just keep averaging down
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880]   but can never seem to find the bottom.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.280]   Historically, do most stocks come back
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   from this kind of decline?
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.920]   Or does the data say to cut your losses
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.480]   even when it feels this painful?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.840]   - Duncan, this one sounds kind of personal to me.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.520]   - Yeah, it's for me.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.880]   - This is a question straight from you.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   - It's actually for me.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   - Which is great.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.000]   But you're right.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.280]   We're getting all sorts of questions from people saying,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.120]   what to do now?
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.960]   All my stocks are down,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.800]   even though the market is doing fine.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.640]   I don't know what to do.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.080]   I think part of this comes from the fact
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.880]   that a lot of people opened up their Robinhood account
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.200]   in 2020, maybe 2019.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.360]   Things were just way too easy
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.440]   coming out of that corona crash.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.480]   So Jason Zweig had this mind-blowing stat.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.800]   I think we've shared it a few times on some other shows.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.240]   From the bottom on March 23rd, 2020,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.680]   over the next year, 96% of all stocks
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   in the US stock market,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.680]   the Wilshire 5000 were up,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.040]   which is basically unheard of.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   That's not normal, even in a good year.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.600]   So let's take a look at some of the stats I got here.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.100]   So if you look at the S&P in a given year,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.560]   so let's say last year, the S&P was up 29%,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.680]   but 13% of the stocks in the index finished down.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.160]   And that's in a year when the S&P
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.000]   had a 5% drawdown at the worst.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120]   In 2020, the S&P was up 18%.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.440]   1/3 of the stocks were negative that year.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.660]   So even in a good year,
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.760]   you should probably expect anywhere
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.880]   from 10 to 30% of stocks to be down.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.040]   And this is one of the reasons that owning the market
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.640]   or owning a fund that's more diversified is so much easier
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.920]   because you can bank on mean reversion, right?
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.560]   You don't have to worry about an index fund going to zero.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.200]   A stock, not all stocks go to zero,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.960]   but some of them just might not come back.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.360]   So let's do, let's take a look at some examples,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120]   I think, of why it's so hard
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.280]   to figure out what to do in this situation.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   So John, let's do a chart of Amazon.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.280]   This is the drawdown profile of Amazon.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.320]   So obviously Amazon fell 95% in the dot-com crisis,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   which was just an unbelievable buying opportunity.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.600]   People look at that and say,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.440]   "Well, this is why you always
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.480]   "buy individual stocks that are down.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.320]   "Look what happened.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.800]   "It's one of the greatest performing stocks of all time."
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.000]   Let's do the Netflix one next, John.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120]   Netflix was down over 70% twice.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.080]   Duncan, remember that time that Netflix decided
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   to send DVDs and split their company
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   into we're gonna do DVDs and then we're gonna do streaming.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.520]   This is before streaming became huge.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.220]   And Netflix fell 80%.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.600]   That was in like 2013, it wasn't that long ago.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   And so you look at these examples and you say,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.120]   "Well, I have to buy then."
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.480]   Because the only thing to do is stock is down is buy.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.840]   Let's do the next one.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.680]   Let's look at Citigroup and AIG.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   This is like the other side of that of,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   you know, when things don't go back.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.160]   This is Citigroup and AIG.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.840]   You can see those huge spikes
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.560]   into the 2000s and financial crisis.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.800]   And then it's huge drop off
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.640]   and they've just never come back.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.600]   These stocks are still down 90% from all time highs.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   Now, these are obviously extreme examples,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.720]   but I just kind of wanted to show what can happen.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.960]   Now let's do like a more middle of the road, I guess.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.840]   Well, maybe this is extreme,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.760]   but let's look at Apple's price return here.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.120]   So this is Apple over the last 10 years.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.040]   This is a stock that's up 1,200% over the last 10 years.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.120]   It's experienced by my count
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.880]   seven different double digit drawdowns,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.640]   including four separate losses of 25% or more.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.320]   And this is in time when the S&P was down 25% just once.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.880]   So even the best stocks are gonna get dinged at times.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.840]   So unfortunately, if you're owning individual stocks,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.800]   you just have to expect this to happen.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.960]   The problem is, like I've never read a good book
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.520]   on when to sell a stock.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.640]   There's plenty of books about Warren Buffett
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   bought American Express after the salad oil scandal,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   or Benjamin Graham bought Geico.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.200]   And you hear all these stories about like,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.620]   when to buy a stock.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.800]   And unfortunately,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.860]   especially when you have more of a fun portfolio.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.960]   So Duncan, you said this is like,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.800]   I'm playing around, I'm having fun, I'm enjoying this.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   I think it's hard-
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.460]   - Was enjoying this.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.580]   - Well, was at one time.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.840]   I think the reason this is so hard is because,
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.520]   let's say you're a fundamental analyst
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.880]   who's looking at stocks for your mutual fund,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.520]   your hedge fund, your professional,
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.720]   or your technical analyst,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.080]   or you're a quant and you have these rules.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.220]   You have rules for when to buy and when to sell, right?
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.720]   If you're a technical analyst,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.960]   you buy when it's in an uptrend,
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.800]   you sell when it's in a downtrend.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.640]   That's pretty simple.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.660]   The variations of that can be different.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.840]   But if you're a quant,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.320]   you have these fundamental numbers where,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   if it hits your screen, you're in.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.280]   If it's not in the screen anymore, you're out.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.120]   It's pretty easy, right?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.800]   Even a fundamental analyst can look at
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.700]   all sorts of different financial statement stuff.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.840]   But I'd say most people who are screwing around
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.140]   in the Robinhood account are probably buying stocks
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.080]   because it's something they use,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.800]   it's something they like, it's a name brand.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.440]   And maybe it's just something that they enjoy.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.640]   And so I think that's why a lot of people buy these stocks.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.160]   And when you don't have a good reason like that,
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.560]   it's hard to know when it takes a dump, what do you do?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.120]   It's just harder to know when to cut bait.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.000]   So here's a stock that I own that's on a severe rollercoaster.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.960]   The name is not important
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.600]   because no one comes for my stock picks.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.720]   I basically get all my stock picks from Josh anyway.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.680]   So the name's not important.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.860]   But I bought this stock in July.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.560]   It had a really nice run.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.920]   And then it went like parabolic
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.160]   when Facebook announced all this metaverse stuff.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.360]   And it was up 100% in like five months.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.960]   Like awesome, I'm the greatest trader in the world.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.640]   And then since the end of November, it's down 50%.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.480]   So I did 100% up, 50% down, I'm back to where I was.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.360]   And you're kind of like, what the, what was that?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.080]   Now what do I do?
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.040]   I'm right back where I started,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.000]   which is better than a loss on an absolute basis,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.240]   but it's kind of hard to know.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.120]   And I think when you're an investor,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.780]   there's a really fine line between discipline and insanity.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.960]   And discipline is sticking to something
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.000]   where you're buying it on the way down,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.560]   you're averaging in.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.480]   And insanity is you're losing all flexibility
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.180]   and now what am I gonna do, right?
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.080]   So it's hard to know because we don't know the future.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.240]   Like which, even though all stocks get dinged a lot,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   especially on individual names,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.080]   we don't know what's gonna happen
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.040]   and which stocks are gonna work and which ones aren't.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.300]   So I think I have some questions
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.360]   you can at least ask yourself.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.720]   Like what's my threshold for pain as an individual investor?
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.120]   Is it 30%, 40%, 50%?
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.580]   I mean, if you're owning an individual stock,
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.760]   you should expect a minimum to see it get cut in half,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.960]   once every few years, probably.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.120]   Not every stock, but most stocks,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.240]   especially if they're like smaller
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.360]   and you're trying to catch a trend.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.920]   Would I be thrilled to buy the stock at lower prices?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.400]   Duncan, you said, well, I've been buying in
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.800]   and averaging down, but I can't find a bottom.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.740]   - Yeah, it's like, because my mentality
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.960]   is that old mentality of like, well, I liked it back,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.680]   you know, when it was at 20, now it's at 15, you know?
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.520]   - And I guess as long as the story hasn't changed too much,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   you know, that kind of makes sense.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.920]   I think you could probably set yourself some rules.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.280]   I'm gonna buy it when it is down 30% from where I bought it.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.840]   Then I'm gonna buy it when it's down to 40%.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.040]   So you can kind of not try to guess.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.000]   Think you can take the guessing games
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.120]   out of it a little bit.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.100]   And then the other thing is just like,
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.480]   do you have better investment opportunities elsewhere?
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.580]   Right, there's this mentality of,
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.480]   I'm just gonna wait until it gets back to break even,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.320]   and then I'll sell, and then I'm done with this thing,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.280]   and it's out of my hair forever.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.080]   But, you know, it's always much easier to sell a stock
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.920]   when you have a gain,
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.740]   'cause you can at least lock in profits.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.160]   Selling when your stock is down is much harder,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.320]   because no one wants to look like an idiot
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.400]   for giving up on the stock that's the next Netflix,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.320]   or Apple, or Amazon.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.160]   On the other hand,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.280]   you also don't want to be in the next Citigroup.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.040]   So I would look at it as an opportunity cost thing of,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.960]   is there something else that I wanted to own that's better,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.400]   or am I really happy this is down 30% or 40%,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.960]   and I can buy it on sale,
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.640]   and see what happens to give myself a longer runway,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.360]   and what kind of time horizon am I thinking about here?
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.120]   - Yeah, and I mean, I guess selling at a loss,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.720]   you at least can harvest some tax losses, right?
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.440]   That's the upside maybe?
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.040]   - There you go, tax planning.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.000]   But yeah, but it's, again,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.440]   there's no good books on this.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.720]   Like, when to sell a stock that's down?
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.280]   Like, really, no one knows.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.160]   And so I think a lot of it has to do with other opportunities
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.840]   why you got into it in the first place,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.900]   and how much pain threshold you can really handle.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.480]   - Yeah, no, that's good advice.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.240]   - Let's do another one. - Okay.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.180]   So up next, we have the following.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.960]   I'm a 25-year-old currently maxing out my 401(k)
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.040]   in Roth IRA.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.540]   This leaves little access in the budget
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.680]   for other savings, emergency fund not included.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.520]   While I feel great about funding my retirement
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.840]   so strongly at this age,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.720]   I have some concerns about being able to save up
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.360]   for big ticket items like a home, a car, et cetera.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.760]   Is there a point where I should consider
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.680]   reducing my tax-deferred contributions
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.120]   to bolster my taxable savings investments
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.440]   for these types of expenses,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.280]   perhaps lowering my contribution to my employer's match?
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.680]   - First of all, kudos to this person for maxing out
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.040]   their IRA and 401(k) at 25.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.960]   That's pretty well done.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.320]   I'm guessing that you're in the minority there.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.360]   I do think it's tough if you're spreading yourself too thin
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.640]   with money that's not gonna be touched for decades.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.480]   I get the idea of, like I've been a big proponent of,
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   invest early and often and let compound interest
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.120]   be the wind at your sails, right?
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.560]   But it can be tough if you're trying to save
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.960]   for a wedding or a down payment or something
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.600]   and all your money's going to retirement.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   I think especially if you've already done it,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.280]   there's no shame in cutting back your max
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.520]   because you can always go back to it,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.960]   especially if you're saving for a down payment
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.720]   and you're gonna save for two, three, five years.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.700]   If you've already built those good saving habits,
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.960]   I'm not that worried about going back to them
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.440]   because you can just take that money you were saving
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.380]   and plow it right back into the 401(k) or IRA
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.880]   when you're done and you hit your goal.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.640]   So John, put up this chart here that I created for my book.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.480]   I looked at what does it take to become a millionaire
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.680]   if you're maxing out your 401(k).
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.520]   Now this assumed the 19,500 max.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.800]   I think it's now 20,500.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.920]   They upped it for the last couple years,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.400]   so I wrote this a couple years ago.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.520]   You can see how low the returns are
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   if you start at an early age.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.340]   This is even at 30 where our listener here is 25.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.480]   If you max out your 401(k) every year,
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.800]   and this isn't even including the IRA,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.220]   it would take a 2% return over 35 years
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.380]   to get a million dollars.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.660]   Obviously a million dollars is no magic number.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.260]   In 35 years it's not gonna be worth as much.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.300]   This was just trying to show big round numbers.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.300]   It doesn't take that much if you're maxing out your account.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.140]   You don't need huge returns.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.180]   So I think if you've already done it
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   and you front loaded some of your retirement
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.860]   objectives and savings,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.540]   I think putting it off for a few years
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.540]   is not gonna be that big of a deal
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.620]   because you know you can go back to it.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.220]   And there's also this thing of in your 20s,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.180]   you don't want to have everything go towards your future
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.020]   if you can help it.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.200]   You should have some money bucketed aside
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.320]   to travel and have fun and go out
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.800]   and not have everything go to retirement.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.400]   So I love the fact that this person
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.640]   is maxing out their retirement at an early age.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.860]   But yeah, if you cut back a little bit,
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.200]   I think you've shown good saving habits.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.400]   There's no reason you can't go back to it later.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.880]   - Yeah, and they mentioned getting the employer match,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.920]   which you guys always talk about
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.320]   being such a important thing.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.280]   - Yeah, if you wanted to use that as your floor,
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.520]   that's probably a good place to go
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.800]   where you're still getting the 100% return from your match.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.360]   Yeah, always, always, always get the match.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.780]   But otherwise, I think cutting back is not a big deal.
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.120]   If you've already shown you can max out your 401k and IRA.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.480]   All right, question three.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.120]   - Okay, so up next we have a question from Josh who writes,
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.940]   "I'm in the lucky situation to have an income
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.820]   "of around $200,000.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.200]   "I'm going to receive my annual bonus in January
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.140]   "with which I would be able to fully fund my 401k
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.980]   "for the year.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.160]   "Normally, I would fully fund it
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.460]   "and then continue to contribute on each paycheck
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.980]   "via the mega backdoor Roth,
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.640]   "which I feel like needs some explaining.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.920]   "Would you recommend continuing to fully fund the 401k
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.160]   "with my bonus in January,
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.100]   "or would it make more sense to dollar cost average
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.260]   "throughout the year?"
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.580]   - All right, so this is essentially a question
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.160]   about lump sum investing or dollar cost averaging.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.680]   Most people dollar cost average
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.120]   because they get paid on a set pay schedule,
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.840]   whether it's weekly, monthly, bi-weekly,
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.160]   or bi-monthly, whatever,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.180]   and they just pay out of their paycheck.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.400]   So lump sum thing doesn't matter.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.600]   But this person got a bonus and they can say,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.880]   "Hey, I can fund it up front."
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.320]   Doesn't make sense to do that.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.700]   I've written about this in the past.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.180]   We get questions like this all the time
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.740]   from people who get an inheritance
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.780]   or get some sort of lump sum with a bonus.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.540]   And even though I've written about this,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.060]   I always refer people to a post from "Dollars and Data"
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.380]   by our own Nick Majulie.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.660]   So I thought I'd bring Nick on to talk about this
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.060]   because he wrote what I think
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.500]   is probably one of the definitive guides.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.880]   He even calls it the definitive guide.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.020]   So let's bring Nick on to hear what he kind of found
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.140]   on this sort of lump sum versus dollar cost averaging thing.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.980]   - Hello.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.020]   - Nick, you've done the definitive guide.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.860]   You've looked at this from a number of different places.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.140]   I think you looked just the stock market.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.380]   You looked at like a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.940]   all these different things.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.500]   What did you find in terms of what's the best route
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.620]   for people most of the time based on the baselines?
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.140]   - I mean, yeah, most of the time,
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.380]   the trade-off you're looking at
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.260]   is risk versus return, obviously.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.940]   So in this case, this person's trying to max their 401k.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.500]   The max right now is like, let's say it's 20,500.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.180]   Let's just say 20,000 for a round number.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.380]   And in the post, I talk about like,
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.620]   if you were to first investing right now,
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.060]   all that 20,000 versus taking,
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.380]   investing over 24 months,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.780]   so dividing that into 24 equal payments,
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.940]   a little under a thousand bucks each,
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.460]   you would have underperformed on average by about 9%.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.940]   So that's over two years, but this is a one-year case,
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.780]   'cause he's like, do I max now or just for the next year?
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.220]   So in a one-year case,
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.980]   you're looking at four to 5% difference in return.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.580]   So on 20 grand, that's like $1,000.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.060]   On average, $1,000 you're gonna be out
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.260]   if you wait to go in versus if you just put it all in now.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.700]   And that's on average, of course, but that's the question.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.700]   So to the reader, to the person who asked the question,
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.140]   like, are you okay underperforming $1,000
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.380]   to average in and reduce your risk a little bit?
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.060]   If you are, then go ahead and go for it.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.140]   If not, that's, but you can obviously underperform more,
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.300]   but that's kind of the main,
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.420]   that's the way I would think about it.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.820]   It's like 5% in a year, about 9% in two years.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.700]   As you go further and further, you wait five years,
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.100]   the underperformance gets really, really bad on average.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.700]   So- - I guess the thing,
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.620]   the thing that you're trying to say
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.500]   is most of the time stocks go up.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.020]   - Yeah, that's basically it.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.900]   So I mean, every, on average, over the last 100 years,
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.460]   stocks are up three out of every four years.
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.620]   So if you can use that as your baseline,
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.180]   like 75% of the time,
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.940]   the stock market is gonna be higher in a given year.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.140]   So that's the basic idea here, right,
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.980]   is that stocks mostly go up.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.740]   I guess the psychological component here is
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.220]   everyone always thinks to themselves,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.620]   well, great, that data's fine on average,
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.900]   but I know I'm gonna be the person who puts my lump sum in
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.340]   and then the stock market's gonna roll over
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.260]   and I'm gonna look like an idiot.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.580]   Right? - Yeah, that can happen,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.660]   but here's the flip side to that.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.500]   Let's say you start averaging in, right,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.300]   and the stock market really starts to tank
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.780]   like it did in early 2020.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.220]   Are you gonna be able to keep averaging
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.180]   while the market's dropping?
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.740]   Are you gonna panic and say, you know what, I don't?
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.700]   So the only time when DCA beats lump sum
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.060]   is the time when you're precisely least likely
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.180]   to wanna keep investing 'cause the market's crashing.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.980]   You feel like you're gonna, you're just throwing,
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.940]   you know, good money after bad as it keeps going down.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.180]   So if you're someone who's like,
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.580]   yeah, I can keep buying when it's crashing,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.420]   then go ahead.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.340]   But most people are gonna be like,
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.460]   oh, you know, maybe I should wait,
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.620]   and then you're gonna sit in cash.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.740]   And we've had, you know,
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.220]   I've talked to people that, you know,
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.340]   that have done this, that were like,
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.660]   they were in cash March 2020,
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.980]   and they were still in cash now,
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.540]   or they were in cash for a year or something.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.740]   It's like they just, everything came back.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.820]   - Yeah, it becomes addicting.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.220]   And I think the other point is,
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.060]   if you're saving your 401(k),
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.580]   and you have decades until you're touching this money,
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.540]   guess what?
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.100]   That lump sum versus dollar cost average,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.660]   even if you make a bad lump sum payment,
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.220]   and you put it right in before market peak,
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.380]   you're gonna be fine decades into the future, right?
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.260]   It's not going to hurt you.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.100]   So most of the time, you're gonna do better.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.500]   And even if you have the horrible luck,
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.340]   over the longterm,
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.140]   it's gonna kind of shake out over the averages
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.180]   where you're gonna be fine
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.860]   as long as you don't touch that money.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.180]   - Yeah, and the differences are small.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.660]   I'm saying that the shorter the difference,
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.500]   like, let's say we said,
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.540]   okay, I'm gonna put it all in this month,
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.860]   or I'm gonna average over two months.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.820]   The difference is so small,
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.660]   we shouldn't even waste our time discussing it.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.340]   And even over the course of a year, 5%,
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.020]   like, that's a decent amount of money,
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.180]   but you know, 1,000 bucks.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.740]   So for this person who's maxing,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.100]   is doing mega backdoor raffle,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.580]   it probably doesn't make a difference for them.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.860]   So just do what's gonna make you sleep at night better.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.060]   For this person in particular,
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.900]   that's what I would say,
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.860]   you know, the numbers say to just put it all in now.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.700]   - Right.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.180]   Duncan, we'll save the mega backdoor off stuff
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.860]   for Bill Suite for tax time, okay?
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.620]   - Okay, yeah, I have no idea what that means.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.900]   So yeah, at some point we'll have to dive into that.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.420]   - All right, one more question.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   - Okay, so this last one's kind of a fun one,
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.740]   because it's a challenge.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.740]   Convince me that leveraged ETFs like SPXL and TQQQ
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.060]   are not better holds than SPY and QQQ.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.500]   I understand there's way more volatility both ways,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.220]   but I cannot find a timeframe greater than a few months
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.900]   where they're not massively outperforming.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.900]   Can you talk me off the leveraged wedge?
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.940]   - All right, I looked these up on Y charts,
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.100]   and when I looked at these graphs,
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.620]   I wanted to punch myself in the face,
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.900]   Edward Norton style from Fight Club.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.420]   So John, show the, this is the SPXL versus SPY.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.940]   So this is a three-time levered versus the S&P 500.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.940]   The SPXL, which is three times levered S&P,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.700]   is up 3,000% since it's launched in late 2009.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   The S&P 500 is up like 400%.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.660]   Oh my Lord.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.300]   Now look at the drawdowns in the next one.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.500]   So this shows a drawdown.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.580]   So this is like the downside of this.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.820]   So you can see that the downside,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.020]   the S&P fell 34% in a corona crash.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.900]   The three times levered fell almost 80%.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.780]   So that's your downside.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.780]   Now let's look at this next one,
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.260]   which honestly kind of blew my mind.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.660]   This is a three times levered NASDAQ 100.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.300]   It was launched in like 2010.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.300]   It's up 17,000% and the NASDAQ 100 is up 800%, 17,000%.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.660]   Oh Lord.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.820]   So look at the drawdown on this one now just to show,
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.060]   even though it was down 70% in the lows.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.500]   Nick, you've looked into this stuff too.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.340]   I have some thoughts on this,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.880]   on what could potentially go wrong,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.740]   but what do you say to these people that,
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.340]   and I honestly, Duncan and I get one to two questions
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.820]   like this every single week, easily.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.140]   People, especially from young people,
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.060]   why shouldn't I just do this?
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.620]   So what is your take on these leveraged ETFs?
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.120]   - I have two thoughts on this.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.020]   The first thought is leveraged ETFs are great
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.900]   if you're lucky.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.020]   So if you get lucky and you don't experience
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.140]   a 2008 scenario, a 1929 scenario where the market's down,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.220]   you know, 50, 60 plus percent,
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.100]   then you're gonna be, look, it went down 33
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.780]   and what was it, down 75, 80%?
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.860]   - Yeah, don't you think in 2008,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.180]   if it's down 50% it's probably down 95, I guess,
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.020]   the three times levered, don't you think?
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.180]   - Yeah, it's basically wiped out, yeah.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.140]   So I think even, I think that's basically
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.980]   like a death scenario where it's just over.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.640]   So that's the first thing, like if you're lucky,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.620]   if you think you're gonna be lucky
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.520]   and we won't experience another 50, 60% plus drawdown,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.540]   then it's great.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.940]   So that's the first thing I'm gonna say,
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.780]   which is obviously kind of ridiculous.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.180]   The second thing I'm gonna say is, okay,
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.980]   if you're gonna lever, maybe do a little bit less,
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.860]   not do a three X, do something a little bit less.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.860]   And why do I say that?
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.480]   So AQR, the quantitative investment management firm
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.900]   wrote this paper, put out this paper called Buffett's Alpha.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.620]   And they looked at like Warren Buffett,
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.820]   like one of the greatest investors of all time.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.860]   He did use leverage with the insurance flow and all.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.820]   I don't wanna get into all that, but he borrowed a little.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.500]   He basically had money he could borrow to invest.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.860]   And the highest his leverage ever got was 1.7 to one.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.220]   So he never went to three X.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.940]   So even if Warren Buffett,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.940]   let's just say 1.5 to make the numbers round.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.840]   If Warren Buffett went to 1.5 on his leverage,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.140]   why would you wanna be going to three or even two?
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.060]   So if there's something that's like a little levered, okay.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.860]   I think like that's not the worst thing.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.240]   It's probably unlikely to go to zero.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.820]   But if you do a three X, I think you're asking
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.940]   for some tough times ahead.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.700]   So that's the only thing I'm gonna say about that.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.620]   - This is like the Gillette thing from the Onion.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.120]   It was like, "F it, we're gonna do five blades."
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.960]   Right? - Exactly.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.700]   - And I agree.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.540]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.260]   The worst case, also bull markets,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.500]   there's very little volatility.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.540]   And these things reset on a daily basis.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   What they wanna do is they wanna capture three times
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.500]   on a daily basis, then they reset.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.340]   And you get the daily basis.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.780]   And the reason that these ones work better
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.220]   than like a volatility one,
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.780]   like there's some of these volatility VIX indices
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.620]   that they follow.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.500]   Those things can get crushed.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.580]   A lot of those are down like 99% from their highs
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.940]   because that churning of volatility,
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.940]   you sort of lose something there.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.980]   But it doesn't happen with the stock market as much
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.180]   because that's resetting.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.060]   And it's a different structure, basically.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.240]   But in a more volatile market,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.140]   even if you move sideways and we get a ton of volatility,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.340]   or we go down a little bit,
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.420]   again, these things in a more volatile environment,
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.400]   'cause in a bull market,
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.140]   things are very little volatility,
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.240]   stair step up, things are okay.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.220]   When there's more volatility,
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.060]   these things could get crushed even in a market
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.780]   that doesn't go down that much.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.700]   So I think this was the best case scenario for these funds.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.620]   So when they rolled these funds out,
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.060]   it was probably the best timing ever.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.980]   And I still can't get over that NASDAQ 100,
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.620]   three times number, 17,000%.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.300]   I would love to see if there's like one person
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.660]   who's held on that whole time.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.540]   But it's, yes, a more volatile market
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.620]   could screw you over with one of these.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.380]   And maybe you talk about sizing it right.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.740]   Maybe instead of like replacing,
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.140]   if you're a person who's at a really ridiculously
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.820]   high risk tolerance,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.020]   don't replace your whole S&P 500 holding with this.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.380]   Take a small percentage and do it
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.220]   and try it out a little bit
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.420]   and see if you can handle the wild swings
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.740]   because they're going to happen.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.620]   So that would be my, again,
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.940]   we get this question all the time.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.340]   I think it's easier to say
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.740]   you have a high risk tolerance for this stuff
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.480]   when we're in a bull market.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.620]   Talk to me when we're in a bear market
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.540]   and if you can really hang on
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.020]   for a 70, 80, 90% decline in these,
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.800]   'cause that is not out of the realm of possibilities
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.860]   at all for this stuff.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it reminds me
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.340]   of the Taleb's Turkey problem, right?
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.300]   It's like the longer you,
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.660]   like you're getting more evidence.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.100]   All these people are like, "Convince me not to do it."
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.260]   You have, every single day,
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.460]   you're getting more and more evidence
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.540]   why they should invest in it.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.780]   But one day, sometime in the future,
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.180]   I don't know when, could start tomorrow,
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.660]   could start 10 years from now,
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.180]   there's going to be a massive crash.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.980]   And a lot of these people are going to get
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.100]   very close to basically all wiped out.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.660]   And that's going to change everything, right?
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.100]   Turkey gets more confidence in their caretaker
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.340]   until the day they're killed, right?
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.460]   It's the same type of thing going on, so.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.300]   - Yeah.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.540]   Someone who says, "Talk me off the ledge,"
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.140]   probably doesn't really want to do it,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.180]   if we're being honest.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.380]   Okay, Nick, one more question.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.580]   How are the supply constraints going for your book?
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.620]   Are we on time?
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.460]   When's the release date?
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.420]   - I think, yes, I think we're April 12th.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.300]   We're on time now.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.460]   Sorry, we had a two-month delay,
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.060]   but it will be out April 12th.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   Just keep buying, very easy to remember, so.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.060]   - All right, and where can people go
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.540]   to sign up for your newsletter?
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.300]   - Just my website, dollarsindata.com,
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.140]   and you'll see on the nav bar, it says newsletter,
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.180]   and you can sign up there, so.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.460]   - All right, awesome.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.780]   We'll have Nick back on when his book comes out, for sure.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.080]   Check out Of Dollars and Data for everything Nick's write.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.180]   He's one of the smartest investment writers out there.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.500]   Duncan's gonna be filling us in
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.900]   in the weeks and months ahead on his Robinhood portfolio
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.380]   to see how things are going.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.640]   If you have a question for the show,
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.300]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.820]   Help us subscribe, like, all that good stuff,

[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:41.900]   - See ya.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.900]   - Thank you.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.320]   (upbeat music)
