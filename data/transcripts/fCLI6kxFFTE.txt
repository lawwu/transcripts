[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   The official name for our car is the MIT Human Centered Autonomous Vehicle.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.080]   But amongst our team her name is Betty, as in Black Betty.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.000]   Today we'd like to demonstrate activity recognition.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.760]   Two stream neural network, optical flow
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.280]   and RGB coming from the video of the driver's body. The output of the network
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.760]   is a prediction of the driver's activity, whether that's
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.040]   texting on the phone, drinking water, or
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.120]   playing guitar. Alright, hey Betty,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.720]   let's go for a drive. Sure,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.760]   Lex. With music? Yes,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.080]   play your theme song. Would you like to play along?
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.800]   Yes. Ready?
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   Yes.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.720]   [music]
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   [music]
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   [music]
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.720]   [music]
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   [music]
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   [music]
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   [music]
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   [music]
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   [music]
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.720]   [music]
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   [music]
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   [music]
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   [music]
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   [music]
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.720]   [music]
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   [music]
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
