[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   Good Friday to you. Welcome back to the podcast. While many Christians live right now in a
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.120]   republic, a form of self-governance where we choose our own representatives, we vote
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.080]   on them, and maybe more than ever, Christians live in free societies. And for them, for
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:28.360]   us, are we required to vote? Is voting a Christian duty? Would it be negligent for a Christian
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.400]   as a citizen of a free society to abstain from an election? We get this question a lot,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.080]   and especially in the last six years, it has become pretty common. And we're closing the
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.560]   week with this most recent version of it, which came from a listener named Danny. "Hello,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.360]   Pastor John. I have been struggling with the question lately about whether or not a Christian
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.320]   who lives in a free society is obligated to vote. God demands that we submit to our governing
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.400]   authorities to pray regularly for them, and he gives us an allowance for civil disobedience
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.360]   in rare cases when it is necessary." Acts chapter 5. "But if in a given election the
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.480]   choices boil down to options I feel no strong conviction toward, or if the election comes
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.560]   down to an option of the lesser of two evil choices, do Christians have the choice to
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.140]   simply not vote at all? In my circles, this does not seem to be an option for a faithful
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.800]   believer. I've been told that this would amount to neighbor neglect on my part. Would it?"
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.400]   Let's come at this by quoting 1 Peter 2, 11 to 17. And what we're going to hear in this
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:52.080]   text is the double identity of the Christian in this fallen world. One identity is sojourner
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.560]   and exile. In other words, this world is not our home. And the other identity is being
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.960]   subject in this world to God-pointed authorities of governors and kings. So one identity is
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.640]   slaves of God, and yes, that is the word used, slaves of God, not at all excluding glorious
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.120]   truth of child of God. Both have aspects of truth in them. So one identity is slaves of
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:30.080]   God owned and ruled by God and no other. And the other identity is one sent by our owner
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   God into a foreign world to make his glory known through gospel words and good deeds.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   So listen for those two identities as I read this text. You are a chosen race, Christians,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   a royal priesthood, a holy nation. Let that sink in. A holy nation. And that's not referring
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.520]   to any earthly nation. That's Christianity. That's the born again people of God from all
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.400]   the nations. You are a holy nation, a people for his own possession that you may proclaim
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.040]   the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. So that's
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   what I mean by gospel words. He called you to proclaim. Verse 11, "Beloved, I urge you
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.320]   as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh that wage war against
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.360]   your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.040]   you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds." That's why I refer not only to gospel words,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.800]   but also good deeds. "And glorify God on the day of visitation." So that's our goal. Make
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:52.880]   God look glorious in this land where we live temporarily as aliens and sojourners. Make
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   him look beautiful, great, valuable. That's our goal. Make God look great. Verse 13, "Be
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.680]   subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be the emperor as
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.840]   supreme or governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and praise those who do
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:21.680]   good." So that's our identity as subjects of God-appointed authority. Verse 15, "For
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   this is the will of God, that by doing good"—there it is again. We've seen it three times now.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.320]   Doing good. "You should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people." Live as people
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.360]   who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as slaves of
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   God. Now there's our identity as God-owned slaves who are in bondage to no man. Live
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.600]   as people who are free—that is, free from whatever human authority is claiming you.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.520]   But know that your master, God, sends you for his sake into that foreign land for his
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.160]   purposes. Verse 17, "Honor everyone, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the emperor."
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.640]   That's the end of the text.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:21.680]   So here's our double identity. Christians are a holy nation called the church, God's
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.760]   own possession, and therefore as a holy nation we are sojourners and exiles in every other
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   nation on the planet, including America. Or to say it another way, we are God's slaves,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:49.240]   meaning we are owned by him and responsible to him ultimately alone, not any man.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:57.560]   Then the other part of our double identity is God's call or vocation for us to submit
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.440]   freely—not because earthly rulers have any final authority over us, but to submit freely
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.920]   to governors and kings and to do good, do good in these foreign nations like America
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:18.400]   where we live for the glory of God. This is the fundamental reality, the structure of
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.640]   the Christian existence that we need to keep in mind when we are thinking about things
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.380]   like voting in this foreign land where we live called America, or wherever you happen
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:37.580]   to live, listening to this around the world, your own foreign land where you live as aliens
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.160]   and exiles as Christians.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.360]   So what are the implications of what I've just read and said? Here's three.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:56.640]   Number one, we cast a vote every week by assembling in congregational worship and singing our
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:06.680]   allegiance to Jesus as Lord over all lords, King over all kings, President over all presidents,
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.940]   Premier over all premiers, Chief over all chiefs. Christ-exalting corporate worship
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:25.280]   is politically the most explosive thing we do. It is absolutely seditious in any regime
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.000]   that presumes to claim ultimate authority or ultimate allegiance over human beings.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.320]   In worship, we say out loud for all to hear, "Jesus Christ is our King over all other
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:47.480]   rulers. We must obey him." Obedience to earthly rulers is relative. Obedience to Jesus
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   is absolute. "The Most High rules the kingdom of men," Daniel says, "and gives it to
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:09.440]   whom he will," Daniel 4:34. As legitimate and even as desirable as a proper affection
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:20.060]   for our earthly nation—in my case, America—may be, as desirable and proper as affection for
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:29.780]   our own earthly nation may be, if weekly worship begins to sound like patriotic rallies rather
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:36.560]   than a celebration of King Jesus over every nation, including our own, we're moving
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:43.600]   away from biblical faithfulness and toward idolatry. That's the first implication.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.480]   Reason number two, there should be no question that Christians, as sojourners and exiles
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:59.020]   on the earth, want to do good for the people and the nation we are part of. Christians
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:07.980]   care about all suffering, especially eternal suffering, especially suffering nearby. Proximity
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:16.060]   applies some measure of accountability. So we bless our communities with gospel words
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:23.100]   and good deeds. That's the implication of 1 Peter. Christians do not want to be part
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:32.180]   of life-ruining problems in society. We want to be a part of life-bettering solutions in
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:38.940]   society. We don't want police to be unjust or unhelpful. We don't want leaders to be
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:46.300]   corrupt but to have integrity. We don't want the infrastructures of water and sewer
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.100]   and electricity and natural gas and roads and bridges and streetlights and fuel supplies
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:10:00.220]   and flood control and building codes and 911 and fire stations—we don't want any of
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:08.300]   these to fail. We are willing to pay for them and do our part to keep things functioning
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.980]   for good, the common good of as many as possible. We want to be a part of helping with the problems
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.540]   of homelessness and poverty and drug addiction and mental illness and criminal behavior and
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.380]   domestic violence. We want there to be safe neighborhoods and good schools and affordable
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.780]   housing and ample jobs and stable economic conditions and international peace. This is
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:42.660]   why Peter, two times in this short text, said that we are to be busy doing good deeds so
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:50.020]   as, number one, to silence those who say Christianity is bad for the world and, two, to make God
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:56.620]   look glorious. That's the second implication. We're not sitting buried away in our little
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:04.140]   caves indifferent to the suffering and the needs of our society. Here's the third, last
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:14.540]   implication. Voting, voting is one form of doing good. It is one kind of good deed. We
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:22.180]   hope by voting for worthy, competent, wise candidates that the common good will come
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:30.420]   to more people. That's our goal. But I don't think it follows from any biblical truth that
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:39.060]   voting is an absolute duty for Christians. It is one possible good deed alongside many
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:46.980]   others, one way of serving the good of society. But there are too many other factors at stake
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:54.540]   to describe it as an absolute duty. One of those factors is this. When the duty to vote
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:03.900]   is elevated to the point where it overrides other Christian principles of virtue, it has
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:12.660]   been taken too far. That duty has been taken too far. At times it happens in a fallen world
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:25.500]   that a vote for any proposed candidate is so offensive, so morally compromised, so misleading
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:32.220]   that it may be a matter of greater integrity, more faithful obedience to Christ, and a clearer
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:40.500]   witness to truth if we do not vote for any of the proposed candidates. And it would be
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:51.460]   irresponsible to assume that a choice not to vote for some party or person on the ballot
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:13:01.540]   is a failure to love our neighbor, when in fact the non-voter may be much more involved
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.380]   in doing socially transformative good deeds than the one who votes for a morally unfit
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:16.420]   candidate because he is considered the lesser of two evils. Life is not simple. It is inevitable
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:25.340]   that Christians will disagree on strategies for how to do the most good with gospel words
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:35.800]   and good deeds and Christian example setting. We must be slow to judge the moral strategies
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:43.620]   of other well-meaning people. Just one more thought. If you believe, as I do, that in
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:54.100]   principle voting is a great gift and privilege in our society and you want to uphold that
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:02.620]   privilege, it is almost always possible to vote by writing in the candidate you think
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:13.700]   is worthy, though not on the ballot. And in that way, you may uphold the precious gift
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:22.040]   of democratic self-government while avoiding the ruinous effects of supporting unworthy
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   candidates.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.940]   Yeah, sure, it is a great gift and a privilege not to be taken for granted or to be taken
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.220]   lightly. Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for joining us today. Ask a question of

[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.940]   We are on a bit of a roll here, addressing controversial topics against the papacy on
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:53.320]   Monday on Voting Today. And up next, this one. Is it a sin to medically attempt to de-gender
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.300]   the body? And if so, why? It's a biggie. It's up next on Monday, Pastor John, and I will
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:00.940]   see you then.
