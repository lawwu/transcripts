[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.160]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in the first chapter and the fourteenth verse.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.080]   The fourteenth verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, which
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.400]   is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.720]   the praise of his glory.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.960]   Now obviously this is a continuation of something that the apostle has already been saying,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620]   so we read verse thirteen as well.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.360]   In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of our salvation;
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.880]   in whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.400]   is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.480]   the praise of his glory.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.760]   Now we here come to a further addition to this tremendous statement which the apostle
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.880]   has been making in this first section of this great epistle.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.840]   As I say, he is obviously continuing something that he has already been saying.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.860]   And if we are to have the full benefit of this particular statement, we must be careful
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.440]   to take it in its context and to see its relationship to that which had gone before.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.880]   I therefore would remind you that the apostle at this point is concerned to show and to
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.440]   display to these Ephesian Christians and others, and therefore to us, God's great plan and
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.160]   purpose, which is, as we are told in the tenth verse, that in the dispensation of the fullness
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.640]   of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.600]   and which are on earth, even in him.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:26.640]   That is the grand purpose, that all things should be reunited again in Christ, that the
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.440]   original harmony which prevailed before the havoc caused by sin should be restored.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   Now that is the great purpose.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.320]   And the apostle goes on at once to say that this plan is already in operation.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.720]   God has already started to put it into operation, and there is at hand a very obvious illustration.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.560]   And that is something which is to be seen, he tells us, in the Christian Church itself.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.080]   The most astounding thing that has ever happened in a sense was the bringing together and the
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.440]   coming together of Jews and Gentiles into one body called the Church.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   Now that was already taking place.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.000]   These very people to whom he was writing were Gentiles.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.800]   And the thing which thrills the mind and the heart of the great apostle is that these people,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.120]   who had been enemies and aliens and outside the commonwealth of Israel, have now been
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.240]   made fellow-heirs with the saints and of the household of God.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.400]   That is the tremendous thing, but it is only a part of God's great plan.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.920]   All things, both those which are in heaven and which are on earth, all things are to
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.440]   be brought together even in him.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.640]   But immediately I say he is concerned with this particular manifestation of death.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.160]   And this is a fact.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.280]   And there need be no uncertainty about this.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.120]   There were some who did still seem to be a little bit uncertain.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.400]   It was a very difficult thing for a Jew, trained as he was and under the influence of the Pharisees
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.880]   and others, it was a very difficult thing for him to believe that the Gentiles could
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.040]   ever possibly become the children of God.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.240]   Traditionally throughout the centuries they had regarded themselves as the children of
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.880]   God and all others as dogs, outsiders, outside the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.920]   And it was very difficult for them to believe this.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.800]   We've got evidence of that even in the case of a man like the apostle Peter.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.000]   In connection, you remember, with the conversion of Cornelius and his household.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.720]   Peter was given that vision on the housetop, you remember, in order to bring this truth
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   home to him.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.880]   And he couldn't quite understand it.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.760]   He said he'd never eaten anything that was unclean or defiled, nothing common or unclean.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.640]   But God had to give him this message, "That which God hath cleansed, that call not thou
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   common."
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.200]   And so Peter saw the truth.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.060]   He saw the message of the vision.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.440]   So he went and preached the gospel to Cornelius and his household and was ready to receive
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.440]   them into the church.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.400]   But it didn't stop at that.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.800]   God gave a positive proof of the fact that the Gentiles rarely were fellow-heirs.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.860]   And that proof was the giving of the Holy Spirit, the sealing with the Spirit.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.400]   Now that's why the apostle introduces this whole subject at this point.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.240]   He's concerned, I say, primarily to say that God is putting into operation this great plan
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   of unification.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.360]   Jews and Gentiles are brought together in the church and there's no doubt about it.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   It's beyond doubt.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.800]   God has given proof of it by giving to the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Ghost exactly
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.120]   as he had already given it to the Jewish believers.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.880]   It was the final proof.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.360]   So that is, in a sense, the great message of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.960]   And how often is the argument put?
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.360]   Peter, you see, was called to count for admitting the Gentiles into the church.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.440]   And his only defense was this.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.480]   He said, "When I saw that God had done to them as he had done to us at the beginning,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.480]   when I saw that God had poured out upon them the Holy Spirit as he did upon us on the day
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.040]   of Pentecost, who was I that I should refuse water to baptize them?"
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   "God," he says, "had set his seal upon them.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.800]   God had done this thing and I could see it.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.720]   And therefore all my arguments had vanished and I knew that God was making them one with
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   us."
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.200]   And the same argument you will find running everywhere through that book of the Acts of
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   the Apostles.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   And now here Paul uses the self-same argument.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.480]   You see, he starts by saying, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance."
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.520]   But then in verse 13, "In whom you also trusted and have had the same inheritance, after that
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.080]   he heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation."
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.880]   And here is the proof, "In whom also, after that he believed, he was sealed with that
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.480]   Holy Spirit of promise."
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.840]   And the thing, therefore, is beyond any doubt and beyond any question.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   Now that is the way, you see, in which the Apostle introduces this whole teaching of
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   his concerning the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, and especially in terms of
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.360]   sealing and in terms of the earnest of the Spirit.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.160]   Now, we've already been dealing at length with the doctrine of the sealing of the Spirit.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:50.160]   And I trust we are all clear in our minds about that, that that is that peculiar, exceptional
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.280]   assurance which God gives to his people.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.440]   It is the Spirit testifying with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.480]   That's the sealing.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.040]   And we are sealed in that way by the Spirit.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.700]   He is given to us and he bears that witness and that testimony.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:15.680]   And we know, therefore, that we are the children of God.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:24.600]   But the Apostle, in his desire to strengthen and to comfort and to build up these Ephesians,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.160]   feels that he can't leave it at that point, because, indeed, there is another aspect of
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:37.360]   this truth which, from the experimental and the experiential standpoint, is, in a sense,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.280]   still more precious.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.400]   So he works up to this tremendous climax which we find in this fourteenth verse.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.440]   He says, "The Holy Spirit, after that he believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession."
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.040]   Now, it's a great pity that the Authorized Version and the others put "which" instead
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   of "who."
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.220]   It should be "who is the earnest."
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.600]   It's the Spirit himself.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.280]   And the Apostle, therefore, takes us on to this truth.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   Now it's very important that we should realize that here, he's not just repeating himself.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.800]   He's not just saying the same thing again in a different way.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.280]   This is not a bit of tautology.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.440]   He really is adding to the truth.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.960]   He's taking us a step further on.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.240]   And what he is anxious, I say, to do here is to help us to see something again of the
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.360]   glory of our position in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.880]   It is all to the praise of his glory.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:50.760]   And here is another facet, another glimpse, another angle, another viewpoint of that eternal
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.480]   glory which resides in our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.640]   Now, it is interesting to notice how the Apostle almost invariably links these two things together,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.480]   the sealing and the earnest.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.840]   You remember that he does exactly the same thing in the second epistle to the Corinthians
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:15.600]   in the first chapter of the twenty-first verse and twenty-second verse, where he says, "Now,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.560]   he which establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God, who also hath
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.000]   sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.320]   That's it.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.640]   He puts them together.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.040]   And then, in a sense, he does very much the same thing, although he doesn't actually
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.720]   use the term for sealing, in the fifth chapter of that second epistle to the Corinthians
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.840]   and in the fifth verse, where he says, "Now, he who hath wrought us for the selfsame thing
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.600]   is God, who also hath given us the earnest of the Spirit."
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:03.200]   Now, it's important, therefore, that we should be clear as to the meaning of this
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.140]   great and important term.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.940]   And important also that we should realize that the Apostle's whole object in introducing
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:20.440]   it here, as he did there with the Corinthians, was to use his own term, "to establish us."
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.680]   And that is why I want to emphasize it this morning.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:31.000]   It is only as we understand this kind of doctrine that we can be truly established.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.920]   And the whole purpose of doctrine is not merely to give us intellectual understanding or satisfaction.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:44.560]   It is to establish us, to make us firm, to make us solid Christians, to make us unmovable,
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.160]   to make us have such a foundation that nothing can shake us.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.560]   And surely if there is one need greater than any other at the present time, it is that
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.480]   Christian people should be established.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.240]   And that we should learn to think of ourselves not so much in terms of particular experiences
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:09.760]   as in terms of our whole position and that which God has planned and intended for us.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.560]   Very well, then, let's look at it like this.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.960]   What is the meaning of this term "earnest," which is the earnest of our inheritance?
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:26.400]   Well, it's a term that is used, of course, in connection with business transactions.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.640]   It isn't used as commonly today as it once was, but there was a time when it was a very
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.360]   common term in all business transactions of buying and selling.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.600]   And everybody has agreed that it has two main meanings.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:51.040]   One meaning is that it is a sort of pledge that is given, or if you like, a guarantee.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.800]   A man might buy a piece of land or buy something else.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.520]   He hasn't got enough money to pay for it all, so what he does is this.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.160]   He promises to pay it all, but for the time being he gives a pledge.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.240]   He gives to the other person something that the other one can hold as a pledge and as
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.000]   a guarantee that the purchaser is rarely going to pay the full price.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   It's a pledge, it's a guarantee.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.680]   But he doesn't stop at that.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:30.320]   There is a richer meaning in this term "earnest," and that is that it is not only a pledge,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:41.360]   but it is also a pledge in the form of an installment, and an installment in kind.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.560]   Now I feel it's rather important for us to grasp the subtle difference of meaning
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.160]   between a pledge and an earnest.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.880]   An earnest is a pledge, but it goes beyond it.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.320]   You see, you can give a pledge for something which is not of the same nature as the thing
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   itself.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.520]   For instance, you may be buying a piece of land and you can give a pledge of money.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.040]   It's a pledge, it's a guarantee, but it isn't an earnest.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:17.880]   What is peculiar to an earnest is this, that it is a pledge or a guarantee which is also
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.440]   of the same kind and of the same nature as the thing itself.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:33.460]   For instance, if it is a question of a transfer of money, well then, if you give a portion
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.400]   of the money, it is an earnest in addition to being a pledge.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.640]   Whereas in that case where it is a matter of money, if you gave an article of clothing
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.480]   or an article of furniture as a pledge, it would still be a pledge, but it would no longer
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.700]   be an earnest.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.400]   The characteristic of an earnest is that it is a part of the thing itself, it is an instalment,
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.880]   it is a first payment in kind of the very thing itself.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:09.160]   Now that is, as I hope to show you, a very vital part of the understanding of this doctrine,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:16.780]   that it is a kind of first instalment of the whole that is to follow, and it is a pledge
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.860]   in that sense and in that way.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:25.820]   There is, incidentally, also another difference between a pledge and an earnest.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.400]   In the case of a pledge, when you are given a pledge to cover something, well, when you
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.280]   give the thing itself, your pledge is returned to you.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.440]   The term pledge or the term guarantee or the term pawn, they mean exactly the same thing.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   You leave your deposit, but then when the time comes that you can make the payment,
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.200]   you are given your deposit and your pledge back, but that doesn't apply in the case
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.120]   of an earnest.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:58.520]   In the case of the earnest, having given this certain portion, well, you don't have that
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.120]   back and it isn't given again, but the remainder is given.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   Let me take a simple illustration.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.520]   Say that you owed somebody twenty shillings a pound.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.800]   You may give a pledge for that.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.760]   You may give a book as a pledge.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.640]   Then when you pay your pound, you are given your book back.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.720]   But if instead of that you gave an earnest, you gave a shilling, let us say, well now,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.120]   when you come to settle up with a man, you don't have your shilling back and then give
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   him a pound.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.280]   No, you add nineteen shillings.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.800]   You have given a part of the whole.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.000]   That is the peculiar characteristic of an earnest.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.160]   And if we are to derive the rich teaching that is in this statement, we must hold on
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.880]   very resolutely to that idea.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.800]   And that is why it seems to me such a grievous thing that some of these translations, which
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.000]   are so popular today, seem to have missed this point completely.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.680]   Take, for instance, the revised Standard Version that has been so popular.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.320]   It seems to me to be not only weak, but totally inadequate.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.200]   It seems to have missed the point completely.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:07.280]   It translates it like this, which is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   of it.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.120]   Well, of course, that is perfectly true.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   It is a guarantee.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:21.220]   But, oh, the word used by Paul goes so much beyond that and adds to it, which incidentally
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.520]   leads me to say something like this in brackets as I pass along.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:32.560]   Let us be careful, my friends, with these modern translations.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.840]   Strict accuracy in language is not everything.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.240]   A bias can come in and a bias does come in.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.200]   And it is very interesting to note how men who may be strictly accurate as regards words,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.240]   when one of two or three words can be used, they may choose a word that is perfectly accurate,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   but it has not the fullness of meaning that another has.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.240]   So it is rather important that you should observe the theological position and standing
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:04.800]   of your scholars, who may be perfectly accurate, yes, but their theological bias comes in.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.080]   And if they can choose the lesser word, they do and thereby detract from the truth.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.600]   I am not here to denounce the Revised Standard Version.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.880]   There are many excellent things in it, but I do notice, and I have called your attention
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.440]   repeatedly in this very section of the Epistle to the Ephesians, to the way in which it seems
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.560]   to almost delight in using the lower word when it might have used the higher.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.400]   It uses guarantee here.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.640]   It is a guarantee, but it is more, it is unearthed.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.640]   Very well then, I say, let us beware, lest we be slaves of fashion, and because a thing
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.600]   is new and the latest, it must be the best.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.200]   We know the theological position of the men who translated the Authorised Version.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.480]   And we know the theological position of most of those on the panel who translated the Revised
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.180]   Standard Version.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.960]   And the difference is often significant.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:06.200]   Very well then, I say, that we must realize that this is the earnest.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:16.000]   It is something which is given us on account, until, that's what he said, who is also the
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.860]   earnest of our inheritance, until.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.860]   Until when?
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.280]   Well, now then, we must come to this next phrase.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.840]   And I am sorry that I have to spend so much time on what may be the mechanics of exposition,
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.280]   but it is so vital.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.240]   It is until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.360]   You notice again how the Revised Standard Version put it, which is the guarantee of
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:47.000]   our inheritance, until we acquire possession of it.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.400]   Well, again, it's legitimate, it's possible, but you notice the emphasis, don't you?
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.160]   It is the guarantee until we acquire.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.480]   The Authorised Version says until the redemption.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   What a word.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.320]   It's been left out, you see.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.240]   Until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.080]   Now, what does all this mean?
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:23.280]   Well, the Revised Version, you notice, is slightly different from the Authorised.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.400]   You have the Revised Version before you.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.920]   It puts it like this, which is an earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.780]   it's kept the word, the Revised is nearer there, the earnest of our inheritance, it's
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.520]   got the earnest as well, the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of God's
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.760]   own possession, says the Revised.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.680]   Now, God isn't mentioned here in the Authorised.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.360]   Well, what do these do?
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.200]   Well, actually, the reference to God is not in the Original, and the Revisers were at
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.440]   that point interpreting.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.720]   It may be a perfectly legitimate interpretation, but I've got to put the two possibilities
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   before you.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.680]   But take this great word "redemption" which the Revised Standard has left out.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.960]   Now, it's in the Greek, it's in the Original.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.040]   The word is there, there's no question about that.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.200]   And as I say, the Revisers have also translated it in that way.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.160]   What does redemption mean here?
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:32.480]   Well, obviously, redemption here means the final completion of God's plan.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.080]   Take, for instance, an illustration to show it.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.560]   The Apostle in writing to the Corinthians in the first epistle, in the first chapter
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:47.120]   in verse 30, says, "Who of God hath been made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.320]   sanctification, and redemption."
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.800]   Well, there is a tendency on the part of some people to think of redemption only in terms
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.120]   of forgiveness of sins, but it isn't.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.520]   It is sometimes, and the context will generally make it perfectly plain as to which it is.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.680]   But obviously, in that quotation I've just given, redemption means the final consummation,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   the end.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   He's wisdom, he's righteousness, there's your justification and forgiveness, he's
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:22.440]   sanctification, and redemption, the whole thing, the completed purpose, the entire emancipation
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.560]   and deliverance.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.080]   And of course, the word that the Apostle used is a very particular and a very technical
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.540]   term.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:39.500]   Redemption does mean, after all, deliverance by means of the payment of a ransom price.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.580]   And if you turn up even Greek, English lexicons, you'll find that the really great ones and
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.660]   standard ones bring out that as they explain this word.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:55.960]   It is the ransom price of the blood of Christ that has been paid for our final redemption
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   and deliverance.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.500]   That's the thing the Apostle's talking about.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:07.180]   The Holy Spirit is an installment given to us until we receive in all its fullness—I
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:13.260]   don't like the word "acquire"—until we receive in all its fullness what Christ
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.020]   has purchased for us by his own precious blood.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:24.060]   Oh, how important it is that we should keep our eye on these various translations and
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.060]   versions.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:30.980]   Well, now then, but the revised, you notice, is slightly different.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:36.420]   The revised says, "which is the earnest of our inheritance and to the redemption of
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   God's own possession."
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.360]   In other words, you can look at this in two ways.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.340]   You can look at it either from God's standpoint or from our standpoint.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.580]   There is God's plan to gather out a people, the fullness of the Gentiles, the fullness
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.580]   of the Jews.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.220]   He's gathered out, known unto God are all his, the foundation of God standeth sure,
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.940]   the Lord knoweth them that are his.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.940]   Very well.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:06.100]   He's got his perfect plan, there's a perfect number, and redemption is when all those have
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.920]   been safely gathered in, and they are God's possession.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.780]   The Lord's portion is his people.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.720]   That is God's possession.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.220]   That's one way of looking at it.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.340]   And obviously the translators of the revised version took that view of it.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:25.660]   Now that is incidentally the view that the apostle himself puts forward in verse 18 in
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.660]   this chapter.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.200]   "He prays that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened, that we may know what
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.180]   is the hope of his calling," and listen, "and what is the riches of the glory of his, God's
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.460]   inheritance in the saints."
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.340]   There is a picture of the saints as God's inheritance, as God's heritage.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:51.020]   And it is a legitimate way to view this particular phrase.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.260]   And yet it seems to me that the authorised is right.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.260]   And the only way in which you can decide is not in terms of linguistics.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:04.420]   You decide only in terms of the context and in terms of doctrine.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.260]   What is the apostle concerned to do here?
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.060]   Well, I say he's concerned to give comfort and consolation.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.040]   And therefore I suggest that he is really putting it from our side rather than from
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.740]   God's side.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:22.260]   He is saying that God has given us something, as it were, until we have the whole.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.860]   So it seems to me that their translation, which is in the authorised, falls more naturally
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.940]   and comfortably into the entire context.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:36.540]   Of course, in the last analysis, it doesn't make the slightest difference to the meaning.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.060]   The day when you and I shall have entered fully into our inheritance will be the day
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.660]   when all God's possession in his people will also be complete.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.500]   It comes to the same thing in the end.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   Very well then.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.820]   Let us now come to the message, to the doctrine itself.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.060]   What's the difference between the seal and the earnest?
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.140]   Well, let's look at it like this.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:09.260]   The seal is that which assures me that I am an inheritor.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:15.820]   It gives me an assurance with regard to myself with respect to the inheritance.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.820]   That's the seal.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.660]   That's what the sealing of the Holy Spirit does.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.940]   What then is the inheritance?
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:28.380]   Well, if you like, the earnest is that which gives me an assurance with regard to the thing
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.020]   itself.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.300]   It gives me something of the thing itself.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.980]   I have received the shilling, I know the nineteen are coming, it's a part of the very thing
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.860]   itself, so it's an assurance in that sense.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.740]   And you see that there is an obvious difference between the two.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:53.700]   The sealing is directly with regard to myself and my position and my relationship to God.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:59.140]   The earnest has a more direct reference to my relationship than to the very inheritance
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.060]   itself.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:07.340]   And therefore this, it seems to me, is the Apostle's teaching.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:14.660]   The Holy Ghost has been given to me and he, by bearing witness with my spirit, has assured
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.740]   me that I am a child of God.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.980]   I have been sealed.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.500]   God, as it were, has said to me, "Thou art my son," that he is peculiarly interested
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.020]   in me, in Christ.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:34.940]   Yes, but he is also the earnest of the inheritance.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.780]   First of all, let's have a glance at that.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.780]   As it is a pledge, I told you that that's the first meaning.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:48.300]   How is the Holy Spirit an earnest of my inheritance in this sense?
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.020]   Well, I believe the best way of looking at that, perhaps, is to look at it in the way
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:57.180]   in which the Apostle expounds it in some of the verses of that great eighth chapter of
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:02.020]   the Epistle to the Romans, which we have read together just now.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:09.420]   Take for instance the eleventh verse, "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:16.820]   from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:22.340]   your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.740]   Now, that's a most important statement.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:32.820]   It's a part of the Apostle's great argument in that chapter, you remember, to the effect
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:38.580]   that we have a fight and a struggle against sin in this world because the body is not
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.580]   yet redeemed.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.500]   In spirit we are already redeemed.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.540]   We are dead to the law.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.100]   We are dead to sin.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.460]   We are in Christ.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.140]   We are risen with him.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.300]   We are seated in the heavenly places with him.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.860]   Yes, but sin remains in this mortal body.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.980]   He's just been saying that if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.580]   the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.140]   Ah, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.020]   Don't be discouraged, he says.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.220]   It's all right.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:15.180]   If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, what's it mean?
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:22.260]   It means this, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.780]   by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:30.060]   If the Spirit is in you, you've got an earnest, you've got a fortest, you've got a first
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.420]   installment of what's going to happen to you completely.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.020]   There is a day coming when your very body shall be entirely delivered from sin and you've
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.860]   got a guarantee of that by the presence of the Spirit within your body.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.940]   Your bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.220]   And because the Spirit is in me, I know that my body is going to be delivered.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.260]   Take it again in the twenty-third verse where he says exactly the same thing.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:03.380]   Not only they, he says, referring to creation, not only they, but ourselves also, which have
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.740]   the firstfruits of the Spirit.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:16.420]   Mean we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to wit, the redemption
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.740]   of our body.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.860]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.540]   We've got the firstfruits of the Spirit, that's the earnest of the Spirit.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:28.860]   Yes, but though we've got that, says Paul, we groan within ourselves.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:34.460]   Of course, modern Christians don't, they're already perfect and they don't know groaning.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.940]   Modern Christians don't groan, they're too happy to groan.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:43.220]   They don't like this sort of doctrine, but the Apostle groaned within himself.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.340]   And he teaches that if we are truly Christian, we should know something of this groaning.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:55.260]   Though we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, we groan within ourselves, waiting for the
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.620]   adoption to wit, the redemption of our body.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:05.020]   Yes, and the presence of the Spirit and the firstfruits within us is a guarantee that
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:11.380]   that is really going to happen, and that our bodies really are going to be finally redeemed
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.100]   from all sin.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.340]   And indeed in that fifth verse of the fifth chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.780]   you've got exactly the same thing.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.940]   You remember the argument.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:30.140]   If our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God, a house
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.780]   not made with hens, eternal in the heavens.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:42.260]   For in this body we groan, same thing you see, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.380]   with our house which is from heaven, if so be that being clothed we shall not be found
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.380]   naked.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:56.660]   For we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened, sin in the body, sin in the
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:02.260]   flesh, the law of the members, we groan being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.660]   but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:14.620]   No, he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing, that's his purpose, is God, who also
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.740]   hath given to us the earnest of the spirit.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:24.820]   The spirit within me as an earnest is a guarantee that though I am thus groaning now I am going
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:30.100]   to be delivered in the body and clothed with that house which is from heaven, the building
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.100]   of God.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.980]   You see it's the same thing.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:39.940]   Very well then, there is some conception of the earnest of the spirit as a pledge, but
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.380]   let us go on and look at the other aspect before we close.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.980]   I can merely hint at it, but how glorious it is.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.900]   The Holy Spirit within us is not only a pledge, he is an installment.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.260]   I like that phrase of Paul, firstfruits.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:03.020]   Even we ourselves which have the firstfruits of the spirit.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.460]   You know what it means, don't you?
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.380]   At the time of harvest you see the man went out and reaped a certain amount and he went
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.420]   rushing home with it and said to his wife, "Bake this, we're going to have the firstfruits."
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:20.220]   They hadn't gathered the whole great harvest in yet, but the firstfruits, how wonderful.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.820]   Having sown and having waited throughout the months, at last it's come, let's have the
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.940]   firstfruits.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.580]   And that is what we have in this life and in this world, the firstfruits of the great
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:38.540]   harvest that awaits us, or if you prefer it you can think of it as a foretaste, it's
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.500]   the same thing exactly.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.540]   You just take a sample, you take a specimen, you just take a little, you don't take it
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.300]   all yet, but you have something to whet your appetite.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.460]   You have something to give you enjoyment, something to ravish your heart and to move
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.460]   you.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.180]   That's what the earnest of the spirit is.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.420]   Well you see what it means.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.380]   We can put it like this.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:07.060]   The Holy Spirit within us, says Paul, gives us a foretaste of heaven.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:12.220]   And Christian people, that's what you and I should be enjoying this morning, a foretaste
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.140]   of heaven.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.340]   Our coming together like this should be a foretaste of heaven to us.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.340]   We meet to consider these things and to talk about them and to discuss them, it's only
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:28.940]   a foretaste, it's only a gathering of the firstfruits, the spirit brings it all to us.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.060]   Well what's it mean?
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.700]   Well you can look at it like this.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.740]   What is heaven?
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.740]   What is heaven going to be for us?
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:45.380]   What does it mean by saying that we are to look forward to the enjoyment of heaven?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.820]   Well, we can't answer the question, but I can say this much.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:58.460]   I'll tell you the chief things in heaven, the two chief things in heaven, seeing him
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.980]   and becoming like him, that's heaven.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:12.580]   That is the very essence of heaven, blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.580]   God.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:21.620]   Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:29.740]   we know that when he shall appear, we shall see him, we shall be like him, for we shall
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:35.540]   see him as he is, that's heaven.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:46.560]   To see our blessed Lord and Savior face to face, to see God, that's heaven.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.660]   It's beyond our comprehension, we can't grasp it, it's so glorious, but that will be heaven
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:36:00.260]   for us, to see God, to look into the face of your blessed Savior who died for you.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.460]   Yes, that's heaven, but what now?
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:09.300]   Well, all we have now is the first fruits, the fortis, and remember, this is the thing
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.260]   I'm about to emphasize, we are to be enjoying the first fruits and the fortis now.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:19.260]   We ourselves, says Paul, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, well, what is it?
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.740]   Well, again, let the Apostle expound himself, listen to how he puts it again in the second
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:33.660]   epistle to the Corinthians, in the third chapter of the eighteenth verse, "Now the Lord is
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:39.420]   that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:49.860]   Listen, "But we all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:58.260]   into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.260]   That happens now.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:08.700]   No, no, we don't see him yet face to face, but we do see him with open face as in a glass,
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:15.660]   with open face, beholding as in a glass, as in a mirror, it's a reflection, we are seeing
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:23.220]   at the moment, but we are seeing a reflection of the glory of the Lord, by the Spirit.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.460]   That happens now.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.620]   But he also puts the same thing in his first epistle to the Corinthians, in the thirteenth
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:34.780]   chapter of the twelfth verse, listen to it, you're familiar with it, "But now we see
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:49.060]   through a glass darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then shall I know
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:54.220]   even as also I am known."
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:38:04.460]   You see, the whole doctrine is there, now, then, now we see through a glass darkly, a
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.980]   riddle in an enigma, as somebody has translated it.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.020]   It's not clear, yes, we are seeing it, we are seeing the real glory itself, but as in
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:17.780]   a glass darkly, the face of the mirror isn't shining sufficiently, it can't catch the
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   full glory.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:26.820]   We are seeing the glory, but only as in a glass darkly, but then, face to face, but
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.780]   thank God, what I am seeing now is a part of the same, it is an installment, it is the
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.060]   first fruits, it is the forties, it is an earnest, it's not only a guarantee, it's
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:42.780]   a part of the thing itself, I am entering into the glory in a measure, even now, that's
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:52.860]   what he said, seeing him and enjoying him, it begins here, imperfectly, only a small
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:59.260]   proportion, only a small percentage, but real nevertheless, the thing itself, as much as
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.640]   I can stand and bear.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.940]   The second aspect, I say, is becoming like him and sharing his life.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.940]   What does that mean?
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:18.660]   Well, we all know that it means perfection, it means absolute perfection, without spot,
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.820]   without blemish, without wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:27.500]   Jude, in his great benediction, says, "Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:34.700]   and to present us faultless, without any fault at all, before the presence of his glory,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.420]   with exceeding joy," but let me give you some descriptions of it, given in the book
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:44.860]   of Revelation, listen to this from chapter 21 verse 8, "But the fearful and the unbelieving
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:52.920]   and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.780]   shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone," which is the second
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:05.620]   death, outside, not in heaven, or listen to it in verse 27, "There shall in no wise enter
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:13.740]   into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:20.940]   But only they which are written in the Lamb's book of life," or take it in the 22nd chapter,
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:29.740]   the last chapter of the Bible, verse 11, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:37.620]   And he that is filthy, let him be filthy still," that's hell, outside heaven, he remains what
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:44.020]   he was, filthy still, "And he that is righteous, let him be righteous still," you see the difference,
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.940]   "And he that is holy, let him be holy still."
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:56.460]   Or take it in verses 14 and 15, "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:02.500]   have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city, for without
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:10.500]   are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:20.780]   and maketh a lie, not that defileth shall enter in its utter absolute purity."
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:26.420]   That's what we shall be when we shall see him as he is and we shall be like him, but
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:32.900]   my dear friends, we get a foretaste of that also in this life and in this world.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:38.840]   The Holy Spirit is an earnest of our inheritance, we are to be beginning the enjoyment of even
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:45.680]   that here on earth in this life and in this world, yes, holiness, we are to know something
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:54.900]   about the joy of holiness, the hatred of sin, the abomination of the world and all its ways
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.980]   and all its desires and all it stands for.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:06.100]   We must learn to hate it as he hates it, and to enjoy holiness and purity and righteousness.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:12.620]   And every thought of holiness, as the hymn puts it, is his alone.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:19.100]   Do you know what it is to enjoy holiness, to feel that his commandments are not grievous,
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:24.900]   but to delight in the law of the Lord, to love it because it is what it is?
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:30.060]   We are to have the foretaste of that here, and likewise love, it's a great characteristic
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:35.320]   of heaven, when we shall see him, we shall love him altogether.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.580]   But we are to begin to love him here.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:44.120]   Paul prays for these Ephesians in the third chapter, that being strengthened with might
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.900]   by his Spirit in the inner man, they may begin to know something of the depth and the height
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.820]   and the breadth and the length, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge,
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.500]   that we might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.820]   Do you love God?
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.820]   In heaven you'll love him absolutely.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.180]   Do you begin to love him here?
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.180]   We are meant to.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:12.700]   If you have the firstfruits, you must, to know his love to us, to love him and to love
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.940]   one another.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.500]   In heaven we shall all love one another, it's to begin here.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.300]   If you've got the firstfruits in you, you'll begin to love one another, because you belong
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.540]   to Christ.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.540]   Love, and the same with joy.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:38.220]   The joy of heaven is unmixed, it's described again to us in these great chapters at the
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:44.140]   end of this book of Revelation, "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:48.260]   and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:55.700]   any more pain, for the former things are passed away," unmixed joy.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.660]   But my friends, it's to begin here.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:04.420]   The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:10.340]   Holy Ghost, whom having not seen, he loved, in whom though now we see him not yet believing,
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.420]   he rejoiced with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:20.460]   Now, Christian people now, filled with this rejoicing that is unspeakable and full of
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.460]   glory.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:27.180]   And if the Holy Ghost is in us, we'll know something about that.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:33.100]   And that is why the Apostle keeps on appealing to the Philippians, "To rejoice," and again
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:42.980]   I say, "Rejoice, and to know something of the peace of God that passeth all understanding."
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:48.140]   Heaven is perfect peace and bliss, but we are to know something about it here, so that
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:53.420]   whatever circumstances may be doing, we may be at peace, whether we are abased or abounding,
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:45:01.220]   in want, in need, in full and in abundance, always enjoying this perfect peace of God.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:14.540]   Well, there's the doctrine, by and through the Holy Spirit within us, as an earnest,
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:21.660]   we are to begin enjoying heaven, even here.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:31.860]   Celestial fruits on earthly ground, from faith and hope, may grow.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:40.980]   Children of the heavenly King, as he journeys sweetly singing, "We are going home to God,"
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:54.220]   in the way the fathers trod, "They are happy now, and we, soon, their happiness shall see."
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:46:01.820]   But though we don't see it all, God in his infinite grace and kindness and compassion,
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.940]   has given us a fortress.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.380]   Are we enjoying it?
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.420]   Do you know him?
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.180]   Do you see him with an open face, as in a glass?
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.620]   Has his glory ever been revealed to you?
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.780]   Do you know something of his love, and do you love him?
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:35.060]   Do you know the joy of holiness, and of purity, and of sanctification, and are you a participator
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:49.180]   in the peace of God, that passeth all understanding, who is the earnest of our inheritance, until
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:55.140]   the redemption of the purchased possession?
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.940]   Amen.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.860]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
