[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   So transfer learning is when you transfer your knowledge from one domain to a new,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.800]   totally new domain.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.560]   And I think that is the key to actually general intelligence.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.240]   And that's the thing that we as humans do amazingly well.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.440]   For example, I played so many board games now.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.840]   Uh, when I, if someone was to teach me a new board game, I wouldn't be coming to that
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.440]   fresh anymore.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.520]   I would know, you know, straight away I could apply all of these different heuristics to
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.920]   that I've learned from other games to this new one, even if I've never seen that before.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.360]   And currently no machines can do that.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.080]   And I think the key to doing transfer learning is going to be a conceptual knowledge.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.760]   So abstract knowledge.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.280]   So the, so the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from the
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.760]   perceptual details of where you learned it from.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   So then you can go, okay, I'll apply it to this new domain.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.080]   Um, so I think that's actually one of the, the, the big challenges to be tackled towards
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.880]   a general AI.
