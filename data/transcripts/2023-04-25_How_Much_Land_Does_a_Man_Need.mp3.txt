[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.640]   "How Much Land Does a Man Need?"
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.280]   Written by Leo Tolstoy, 1886.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.040]   An elder sister came to visit her younger sister
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.380]   in the country.
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.220]   The elder was married to a tradesman in town,
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.780]   the younger to a peasant in the village.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.820]   As the sisters sat over their tea talking,
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.660]   the elder began to boast of the advantages of town life,
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.960]   saying how comfortably they lived there,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300]   how well they dressed,
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.420]   what fine clothes her children wore,
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.360]   what good things they ate and drank,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760]   and how she went to the theater,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.400]   promenades, and entertainments.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.200]   The younger sister was piqued,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.980]   and in turn disparaged the life of a tradesman
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.640]   and stood up for that of a peasant.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.880]   "I would not change my way of life for yours," said she.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.080]   "We may live roughly,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.580]   but at least we are free from anxiety.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.520]   You live in better style than we do,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.180]   but though you often earn more than you need,
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.760]   you are very likely to lose all you have.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.060]   You know the proverb,
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.720]   'Loss and gain are brothers twain.'
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.860]   It often happens that people who are wealthy one day
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.600]   are begging their bread the next.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.240]   Our way is safer.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.500]   Though a peasant's life is not a fat one,
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.900]   it is a long one.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.300]   We shall never grow rich,
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.800]   but we shall always have enough to eat."
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.980]   The elder sister said sneeringly,
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.140]   "Enough, yes, if you'd like to share
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.940]   with the pigs and the calves.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.420]   What do you know of elegance or manners?
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.460]   However much your good man may slave,
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.360]   you will die as you are living on a dung heap
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.260]   and your children the same."
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.420]   "Well, what of that?" replied the younger.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.460]   "Of course our work is rough and coarse,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.300]   but on the other hand, it is sure,
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.760]   and we need not bow to anyone.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.140]   But you and your towns are surrounded by temptations.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.780]   Today, all may be right,
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.380]   but tomorrow the evil one may tempt your husband
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.340]   with cards, wine, or women,
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.380]   and all will go to ruin.
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.820]   Don't such things happen often enough?"
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.080]   Pahom, the master of the house,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.380]   was lying on the top of the oven,
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.880]   and he listened to the women's chatter.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.260]   "It is perfectly true," thought he.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.820]   "Busy as we are from childhood, tilling mother earth,
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.320]   we peasants have no time
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.100]   to let any nonsense settle in our heads.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.940]   Our only trouble is that we haven't land enough.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.460]   If I had plenty of land,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.700]   I shouldn't fear the devil himself."
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.800]   The women finished their tea,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.380]   chatted a while about dress,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.940]   and then cleared away the tea things and lay down to sleep.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.540]   But the devil had been sitting behind the oven
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.840]   and had heard all that was said.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140]   He was pleased that the peasant's wife
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.120]   had led her husband into boasting,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   and that he had said that if he had plenty of land,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.620]   he would not fear the devil himself.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.260]   "All right," thought the devil,
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.660]   "we'll have a tussle.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.360]   I'll give you land enough,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.660]   and by means of that land, I will get you into my power."
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.360]   Close to the village, there lived a lady,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   a small landowner who had an estate of about 300 acres.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.060]   She had always lived on good terms with the peasants
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.080]   until she engaged as her steward, an old soldier,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.000]   who took to burdening the people with fines.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.120]   However careful Pahom tried to be,
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.320]   it happened again and again
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.040]   that now a horse of his got among the lady's oats,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.240]   now a cow straight into her garden,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   now his calves found their way into her meadows,
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.920]   and he always had to pay a fine.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.400]   Pahom paid, but grumbled,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.240]   and going home in a temper was rough with his family.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.440]   All through that summer,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.960]   Pahom had much trouble because of this steward,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.840]   and he was even glad when winter came
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.760]   and the cattle had to be stabled.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.280]   Though he grudged the fodder
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.240]   when they could no longer graze on the pasture land,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.360]   at least he was free from anxiety about them.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.760]   In the winter, the news got about
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.720]   that the lady was going to sell her land,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   and that the keeper of the inn on the high road
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.220]   was bargaining for it.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.760]   When the peasants heard this, they were very much alarmed.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   Well, thought they, if the innkeeper gets the land,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.480]   he will worry us with fines worse than the lady's steward.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.840]   We all depend on that estate.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   So the peasants went on behalf of their commune
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.960]   and asked the lady not to sell the land to the innkeeper,
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.060]   offering her a better price for it themselves.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.960]   The lady agreed to let them have it.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.080]   Then the peasants tried to arrange for the commune
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.360]   to buy the whole estate,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.980]   so that it might be held by all in common.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.460]   They met twice to discuss it,
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.160]   but could not settle the matter.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   The evil ones sowed discord among them,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.200]   and they could not agree.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.840]   So they decided to buy the land individually,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.440]   each according to his means,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.040]   and the lady agreed to this plan as she had to the other.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.260]   Presently, Pahom heard that a neighbor of his
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.880]   was buying 50 acres,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.120]   and that the lady had consented to accept one half in cash
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.320]   and to wait a year for the other half.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.280]   Pahom felt envious.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.120]   Look at that, thought he.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.080]   The land is all being sold, and I shall get none of it.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.280]   So he spoke to his wife.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.080]   Other people are buying, said he,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.560]   and we must also buy 20 acres or so.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   Life is becoming impossible.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.500]   That steward is simply crushing us with his fines.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.780]   So they put their heads together
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.280]   and considered how they could manage to buy it.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.080]   They had 100 rubles laid by.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.940]   They sold a colt and one half of their bees,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.160]   hired out one of their sons as a laborer,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.120]   and took his wages in advance,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.960]   borrowed the rest from a brother-in-law,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   and so scraped together half the purchase money.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.600]   Having done this, Pahom chose out a farm of 40 acres,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.800]   some of it wooded, and went to the lady to bargain for it.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.880]   They came to an agreement,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.720]   and he shook hands with her upon it
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.280]   and paid her a deposit in advance.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.620]   Then they went to town and signed the deeds,
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.760]   he paying half the price down
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.060]   and undertaking to pay the remainder within two years.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.440]   So now Pahom had land of his own.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.220]   He borrowed seed and sowed it on the land he had bought.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.640]   The harvest was a good one,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.940]   and within a year he had managed to pay off his debts
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.640]   both to the lady and to his brother-in-law.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.980]   So he became a landowner, plowing and sowing his own land,
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.960]   making hay on his own land,
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.240]   cutting his own trees,
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   and feeding his cattle on his own pasture.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.720]   When he went out to plow his fields,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.160]   or to look at his growing corn, or at his grass meadows,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   his heart would fill with joy.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.480]   The grass that grew and the flowers that bloomed there
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.240]   seemed to him unlike any that grew elsewhere.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.440]   Formerly, when he had passed by that land,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.640]   it had appeared the same as any other land,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.820]   but now it seemed quite different.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.400]   So Pahom was well-contented,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.460]   and everything would have been right
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.920]   if the neighboring peasants would only not have trespassed
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   on his cornfields and meadows.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.520]   He appealed to them most civilly, but they still went on.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.260]   Now the communal herdsmen would let the village cows
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.640]   stray into his meadows,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.840]   then horses from the night pasture would get among his corn.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.360]   Pahom turned them out again and again
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.000]   and forgave their owners.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.100]   And for a long time, he forbore from prosecuting anyone.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.600]   But at last he lost patience
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.960]   and complained to the district court.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.120]   He knew it was the peasants' want of land
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.160]   and no evil intent on their part that caused the trouble.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.800]   But he thought, "I cannot go on overlooking it,
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.280]   "or they will destroy all I have.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.460]   "They must be taught a lesson."
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.680]   So he had them up, gave them one lesson, and then another,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.160]   and two or three of the peasants were fined.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.880]   After a time, Pahom's neighbors
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.720]   began to bear him a grudge for this
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.920]   and would now and then let their cattle
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.200]   on to his land on purpose.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.520]   One peasant even got into Pahom's wood at night
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.920]   and cut down five young lime trees for their bark.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.000]   Pahom, passing through the wood one day,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.520]   noticed something white.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.880]   He came nearer and saw the stripped trunks
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.080]   lying on the ground,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.360]   and close by stood the stumps where the tree had been.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.280]   Pahom was furious.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.920]   "If he'd only cut one here and there,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.940]   "it would have been bad enough," thought Pahom.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.440]   "But the rascal has actually cut down a whole clump.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.040]   "If I could only find out who did this, I would pay him out."
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.300]   He racked his brains as to who it could be.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.920]   Finally, he decided, "It must be Simon.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.660]   "No one else could have done it."
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.880]   So he went to Simon's homestead to have a look around,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   but he found nothing and only had an angry scene.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.680]   However, he now felt more certain than ever
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.520]   that Simon had done it, and he lodged a complaint.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.000]   Simon was summoned.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.120]   The case was tried and retried,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.160]   and at the end of it all, Simon was acquitted,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.200]   there being no evidence against him.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.280]   Pahom felt still more aggrieved
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.320]   and let his anger loose upon the elder and the judges.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.300]   "You let thieves grease your palms," said he.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.960]   "If you were honest folk yourselves,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.840]   "you would not let a thief go free."
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.780]   So Pahom quarreled with the judges and with his neighbors.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.680]   Threats to burn his building began to be uttered.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.960]   So, though Pahom had more land,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.560]   his place in the commune was much worse than before.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.320]   About this time, a rumor got about
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.720]   that many people were moving to new parts.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.860]   "There's no need for me to leave my land," thought Pahom.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.800]   "But some of the others might leave our village,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.500]   "and then there would be more room for us.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.060]   "I would take over their land myself
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.680]   "and make my estate a bit bigger.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.480]   "I could then live more at ease.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.960]   "As it is, I am still too cramped to be comfortable."
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.880]   One day, Pahom was sitting at home
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.500]   when a peasant passing through the village
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.840]   happened to call in.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.960]   He was allowed to stay the night and supper was given him.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.800]   Pahom had a talk with this peasant
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.480]   and asked him where he came from.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.460]   The stranger answered that he came from beyond the Volga,
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.080]   where he had been working.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.800]   One word led to another, and the man went on to say
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.400]   that many people were settling in those parts.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.440]   He told how some people from his village had settled there.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.720]   They had joined the commune
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.440]   and had had 25 acres per man granted them.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.240]   "The land was so good," he said,
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.140]   "that the rye sown on it grew as high as a horse
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.520]   "and so thick that five cuts of a sickle made a sheaf."
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.800]   One peasant, he said, had brought nothing with him
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.080]   but his bare hands, and now he had six horses
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   and two cows of his own.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.800]   Pahom's heart kindled with desire.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.740]   He thought, "Why should I suffer in this narrow hole
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.660]   "if one can live so well elsewhere?
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.240]   "I will sell my land and my homestead here,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.480]   "and with the money, I will start afresh over there
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.860]   "and get everything new.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.660]   "In this crowded place, one is always having trouble,
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.360]   "but I must first go and find out all about it myself."
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.560]   Towards summer, he got ready and started.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   He went down the Volga on a steamer to Samara,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.600]   then walked another 300 miles on foot,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.040]   and at last reached the place.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.460]   He was just as the stranger had said.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.520]   The peasants had plenty of land,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.240]   every man had 25 acres of communal land
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.640]   given him for his use,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.840]   and anyone who had money could buy,
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.000]   besides, at two shillings an acre,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.040]   as much good freehold land as he wanted.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.240]   Having found out all he wished to know,
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.640]   Pahom returned home as autumn came on
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.880]   and began selling off his belongings.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.740]   He sold his land at a profit,
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.960]   sold his homestead and all his cattle,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.560]   and withdrew from membership of the commune.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.080]   He only waited till the spring,
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.040]   and then started with his family for the new settlement.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.160]   As soon as Pahom and his family arrived at their new abode,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.520]   he applied for admission into the commune of a large village.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.000]   He stood treat to the elders
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.020]   and obtained the necessary documents.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.100]   Five shares of communal land were given him
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.340]   for his own and his son's use,
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.920]   that is to say 125 acres,
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.120]   not all together, but in different fields,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.680]   besides the use of the communal pasture.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.000]   Pahom put up the buildings he needed and bought cattle.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.440]   Of the communal land alone,
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.680]   he had three times as much as at his former home,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.760]   and the land was good corn land.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.160]   He was 10 times better off than he had been.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.240]   He had plenty of arable land and pasturage,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.160]   and could keep as many head of cattle as he liked.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.200]   At first, in the bustle of building and settling down,
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.120]   Pahom was pleased with it all,
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.080]   but when he got used to it,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.700]   he began to think that even here he had not enough land.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.300]   The first year, he sowed wheat
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.660]   on his share of the communal land and had a good crop.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.460]   He wanted to go on sowing wheat,
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.260]   but had not enough communal land for the purpose,
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.020]   and what he already used was not available,
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.240]   for in those parts,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.300]   weed is only sown on virgin soil or on fallow land.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.080]   It is sown for one or two years,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.300]   and then the land lies fallow
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.140]   till it is again overgrown with prairie grass.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.860]   There were many who wanted such land,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.960]   and there was not enough for all,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.840]   so that people quarreled about it.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.180]   Those who were better off wanted it for growing wheat,
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.040]   and those who were poor wanted it to let to dealers
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.780]   so that they might raise money to pay their taxes.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.720]   Pahom wanted to sow more wheat,
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.100]   so he rented land from a dealer for a year.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.640]   He sowed much wheat and had a fine crop,
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.840]   but the land was too far from the village.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.560]   The wheat had to be carted more than 10 miles.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.140]   After a time, Pahom noticed that some peasant dealers
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.280]   were living on separate farms and were growing wealthy,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.600]   and he thought,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.840]   "If I were to buy some freehold land
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.400]   and have a homestead on it,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.720]   it would be a different thing altogether.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.880]   Then it would all be nice and compact."
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.860]   The question of buying freehold land
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.080]   recurred to him again and again.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.980]   He went on in the same way for three years,
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.360]   renting land and sowing wheat.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.840]   The seasons turned out well and the crops were good,
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.880]   so that he began to lay money by.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.080]   He might have gone on living contentedly,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.660]   but he grew tired of having to rent
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.400]   other people's land every year
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.480]   and having to scramble for it.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.060]   Wherever there was good land to be had,
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.400]   the peasants would rush for it,
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.960]   and it was taken up at once,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.680]   so that unless you were sharp about it, you got none.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.360]   It happened in the third year
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.320]   that he and a dealer together rented a piece of pasture land
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   from some peasants,
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.800]   and they had already plowed it up
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.280]   when there was some dispute,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.000]   and the peasants went to law about it,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.200]   and things fell out so that the labor was all lost.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.700]   "If it were my own land," thought Pahom,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.120]   "I should be independent,
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.080]   "and there would not be all this unpleasantness."
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.520]   So Pahom began looking out for land which he could buy,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.880]   and he came across a peasant who had bought 1,300 acres,
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.120]   but having got into difficulties,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.040]   was willing to sell again cheap.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.160]   Pahom bargained and haggled with him,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.180]   and at last they settled the price at 1,500 rubles,
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.000]   part in cash and part to be paid later.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.860]   They had all but clinched the matter
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.560]   when a passing dealer happened to stop at Pahom's one day
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.840]   to get a feed for his horse.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.700]   He drank tea with Pahom, and they had a talk.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.620]   The dealer said that he was just returning
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.640]   from the land of the Bashkirs, far away,
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.620]   where he had bought 13,000 acres of land,
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.040]   all for 1,000 rubles.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.760]   Pahom questioned him further,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.380]   and the tradesman said,
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.080]   "All one need do is to make friends with the chiefs.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.400]   "I gave away about 100 rubles worth of dressing gowns
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   "and carpets, besides a case of tea,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.320]   "and I gave wine to those who would drink it,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.080]   "and I got the land for less than two pence an acre."
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.480]   And he showed Pahom the title deed, saying,
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.300]   "The land lies near a river,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.520]   "and the whole prairie is virgin soil."
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.980]   Pahom plied him with questions, and the tradesman said,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.000]   "There is more land than you could cover
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   "if you walked a year, and it all belongs to the Bashkirs.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.740]   "They are as simple as sheep,
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.300]   "and land can be got almost for nothing."
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.440]   "There now," thought Pahom, "with my 1,000 rubles,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.000]   "why should I get only 1,300 acres
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.600]   "and saddle myself with a debt besides?
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.880]   "If I take it out there,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.540]   "I can get more than 10 times as much for the money."
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.700]   Pahom inquired how to get to the place,
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.820]   and as soon as the tradesman had left him,
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.100]   he prepared to go there himself.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.340]   He left his wife to look after the homestead,
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.460]   and started on his journey, taking his man with him.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.020]   They stopped at a town on their way,
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.580]   and bought a case of tea, some wine, and other presents,
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.860]   as the tradesman had advised.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.820]   On and on they went,
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.580]   until they had gone more than 300 miles,
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.500]   and on the seventh day, they came to a place
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.820]   where the Bashkirs had pitched their tents.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.460]   It was all just as the tradesman had said.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.320]   "The people lived on the steps,
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.860]   "by a river, in felt-covered tents.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.120]   "They neither tilled the ground, nor ate bread.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.360]   "Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the step.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.180]   "The colts were tethered behind the tents,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.760]   "and the mares were driven to them twice a day.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.780]   "The mares were milked, and from the milk,
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.260]   "cumus was made.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.940]   "It was the women who prepared cumus,
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.760]   "and they also made cheese.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.260]   "As far as the men were concerned,
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.620]   "drinking cumus and tea, eating mutton,
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.200]   "and playing on their pipes was all they cared about.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.000]   "They were all stout and merry,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.320]   "and all the summer long,
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.380]   "they never thought of doing any work.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.880]   "They were quite ignorant, and knew no Russian,
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.860]   "but were good-natured enough.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.260]   "As soon as they saw up a home,
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.380]   "they came out of their tents,
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.140]   "and gathered round their visitor.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.340]   "An interpreter was found,
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.160]   "and Pahom told them he had come about some land.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.280]   "The Bashkirs seemed very glad.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.340]   "They took Pahom, and led him into one of the best tents,
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.100]   "where they made him sit on some down cushions
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.720]   "placed on a carpet while they sat round him.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.640]   "They gave him tea and cumus,
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.360]   "and had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to eat.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.940]   "Pahom took presents out of his cart,
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.820]   "and distributed them among the Bashkirs,
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.220]   "and divided among them the tea.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.160]   "The Bashkirs were delighted.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.900]   "They talked a great deal among themselves,
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.440]   "and then told the interpreter to translate.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.480]   "'They wish to tell you,' said the interpreter,

[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.460]   "'What pleases me best here,' answered Pahom,

[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.900]   "but saw that they were much amused,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.060]   "and that they shouted and laughed.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.940]   "Then they were silent, and looked at Pahom

[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.520]   "The Bashkirs talked again for a while,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.360]   "and began to dispute.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.720]   "Pahom asked what they were disputing about,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.920]   "and the interpreter told him that some of them
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.080]   "thought they ought to ask their chief about the land,
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.100]   "and not act in his absence,
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.960]   "while others thought there was no need

[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.540]   "a man in a large fox fur cap appeared on the scene.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.180]   "They all became silent and rose to their feet.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.600]   "The interpreter said, 'This is our chief himself.'
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.480]   "Pahom immediately fetched the best dressing gown
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.160]   "and five pounds of tea, and offered these to the chief.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.320]   "The chief accepted them,
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.980]   "and seated himself in the place of honor.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.900]   "The Bashkirs at once began telling him something.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.320]   "The chief listened for a while,
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.880]   "then made a sign with his head for them to be silent,
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.120]   "and addressing himself to Pahom said in Russian,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.060]   "'Well, let it be so.

[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.500]   "'How can I take as much as I like?' thought Pahom.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.460]   "'I must get a deed to make it secure,

[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.360]   "'and afterwards may take it away again.'
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.900]   "'Thank you for your kind words,' he said aloud.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.420]   "'You have much land, and I only want a little,

[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.600]   "'You are quite right,' said the chief.

[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.980]   "'I heard that a dealer had been here,' continued Pahom,
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.020]   "'and that you gave him a little land too,
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.320]   "'and signed title deeds to that effect.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.860]   "'I should like to have it done in the same way.'
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.280]   "The chief understood.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.160]   "'Yes,' replied he, 'that can be done quite easily.

[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.040]   "'And what will be the price?' asked Pahom.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.400]   "'Our price is always the same, 1,000 rubles a day.'
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.680]   "Pahom did not understand.

[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.240]   "'We do not know how to reckon it out,' said the chief.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.760]   "'We sell it by the day.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.220]   "'As much as you can go round on your feet in a day is yours,

[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.320]   "sitting there and chuckling.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.160]   "And before him lay a man barefoot,
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.080]   "prostrate on the ground with only trousers and a shirt on.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.280]   "And Pahom dreamed that he looked more attentively
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.520]   "to see what sort of man it was lying there,
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.720]   "and he saw that the man was dead, and that it was himself.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.220]   "He awoke, horror struck.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.400]   "What things one does dream, thought he.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.320]   "Looking round, he saw through the open door
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.960]   "that the dawn was breaking.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   "It's time to wake them up, thought he.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.560]   "We ought to be starting.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.040]   "He got up, roused his man, who was sleeping in his cart,
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.640]   "bade him harness, and went to call the Bashkirs.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.920]   "It's time to go to the step to measure the land, he said.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.400]   "The Bashkirs rose and assembled, and the chief came too.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.240]   "Then they began drinking koumiss again
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.080]   "and offered Pahom some tea, but he would not wait.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.360]   "If we are to go, let us go.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.540]   "It is high time, said he.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.860]   "The Bashkirs got ready, and they all started,
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.980]   "some mounted on horses and some in carts.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.780]   "Pahom drove in his own small cart with his servant,
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.720]   "and took a spade with him.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.860]   "When they reached the step,
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.180]   "the morning red was beginning to kindle.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.660]   "They ascended a hillock,
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.400]   "called by the Bashkirs a shikan,
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.740]   "and dismounting from their carts and their horses,
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.640]   "gathered in one spot.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.380]   "The chief came up to Pahom
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.800]   "and stretched out his arm towards the plain.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.140]   "See, said he, all this,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.740]   "as far as your eye can reach, is ours.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.780]   "You may have any part of it you like."
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.460]   Pahom's eyes glistened.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.220]   It was all virgin soil, as flat as the palm of your hand,
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.140]   as black as the seat of a poppy,
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.180]   and in the hollows,
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.760]   different kinds of grasses grew breast high.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.380]   The chief took off his fox fur cap,
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.160]   placed it on the ground, and said,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.380]   "This will be the mark.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.000]   "Start from here and return here again.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.100]   "All the land you go round shall be yours."
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.900]   Pahom took out his money and put it on the cap.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.740]   Then he took off his outer coat,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.340]   remaining in his sleeveless undercoat.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.820]   He unfastened his girdle
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.820]   and tied it tight below his stomach,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.300]   put a little bag of bread into the breast of his coat,
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.460]   and tying a flask of water to his girdle,
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.240]   he drew up the tops of his boots,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.200]   took the spade from his man, and stood ready to start.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.260]   He considered for some moments which way he had better go.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.540]   It was tempting everywhere.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.040]   No matter, he concluded,
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.380]   I will go towards the rising sun.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.700]   He turned his face to the east, stretched himself,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.980]   and waited for the sun to appear above the rim.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.020]   I must lose no time, he thought,
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.780]   and it is easier walking while it is still cool.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.420]   The sun's rays had hardly flashed above the horizon
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.460]   before Pahom, carrying the spade over his shoulder,
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.660]   went down into the steppe.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.140]   Pahom started walking neither slowly nor quickly.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.440]   After having gone 1,000 yards, he stopped,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.940]   dug a hole, and placed pieces of turf one on another
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.500]   to make it more visible.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.540]   Then he went on, and now that he had walked off
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.540]   his stiffness, he quickened his pace.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.860]   After a while, he dug another hole.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.420]   Pahom looked back.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.340]   The hillock could be distinctly seen in the sunlight
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.420]   with the people on it
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.980]   and the glittering tires of the cartwheels.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.580]   At a rough guess, Pahom concluded
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.740]   that he had walked three miles.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.260]   It was growing warmer.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.800]   He took off his undercoat, flung it across his shoulder,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.300]   and went on again.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.040]   It had grown quite warm now.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.460]   He looked at the sun.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.640]   It was time to think of breakfast.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.400]   The first shift is done, but there are four in a day,
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.300]   and it is too soon yet to turn.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.700]   But I will just take off my boots, said he to himself.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.460]   He sat down, took off his boots,
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.600]   stuck them into his girdle, and went on.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.540]   It was easier walking now.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.180]   I will go on for another three miles, thought he,
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.800]   and then turn to the left.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.580]   The spot is so fine that it would be a pity to lose it.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.660]   The further one goes, the better the land seems.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.580]   He went straight on for a while,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.420]   and when he looked around, the hillock was scarcely visible,
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.860]   and the people on it looked like black ants,
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.940]   and he could just see something glistening there in the sun.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.580]   Ah, thought Pahom.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.260]   I've gone far enough in this direction.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.460]   It is time to turn.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.540]   Besides, I'm in a regular sweat and very thirsty.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.660]   He stopped, dug a large hole, and heaped up pieces of turf.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.180]   Next, he untied his flask, had a drink,
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.540]   and then turned sharply to the left.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.700]   He went on and on.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.300]   The grass was high, and it was very hot.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.400]   Pahom began to grow tired.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.980]   He looked at the sun and saw that it was noon.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.860]   Well, he thought, I must have a rest.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.800]   He sat down and ate some bread and drank some water,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.220]   but he did not lie down,
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.020]   thinking that if he did, he might fall asleep.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.540]   After sitting a little while, he went on again.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.060]   At first, he walked easily.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.980]   The food had strengthened him,
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.760]   but it had become terribly hot, and he felt sleepy.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.220]   Still, he went on, thinking,
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.820]   an hour to suffer, a lifetime to live.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.860]   He went a long way in this direction also,
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.420]   and was about to turn to the left again
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.500]   when he perceived a damp hollow.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.620]   Be a pity to leave that out, he thought.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.380]   Flax would do well there.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.840]   So he went on past the hollow and dug a hole
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.620]   on the other side of it before he turned the corner.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.260]   Pahom looked towards the hillock.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.340]   The heat made the air hazy.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.820]   It seemed to be quivering, and through the haze,
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.700]   the people on the hillock could scarcely be seen.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.820]   Ah, thought Pahom, I have made the sides too long.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.700]   I must make this one shorter.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.540]   And he went along the third side, stepping faster.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.020]   He looked at the sun.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.180]   It was nearly halfway to the horizon,
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.380]   and he had not yet done two miles
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.060]   of the third side of the square.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.540]   He was still 10 miles from the goal.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.740]   No, he thought, though it will make my land lopsided,
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.840]   I must hurry back in a straight line now.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.660]   I might go too far, and as it is,
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.580]   I have a great deal of land.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.900]   So Pahom hurriedly dug a hole
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.220]   and turned straight towards the hillock.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.060]   Pahom went straight towards the hillock,
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.940]   but now he walked with difficulty.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.620]   He was done up with the heat.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.580]   His bare feet were cut and bruised,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.620]   and his legs began to fail.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.380]   He longed to rest, but it was impossible
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.340]   if he meant to get back before sunset.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.500]   The sun waits for no man,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.420]   and it was sinking lower and lower.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.100]   Oh dear, he thought, if only I have not blundered
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.220]   trying for too much.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.860]   What if I'm too late?
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.300]   He looked towards the hillock and at the sun.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.080]   He was still far from his goal,
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.580]   and the sun was already nearing the rim.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.620]   Pahom walked on and on.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.660]   It was very hard walking, but he went quicker and quicker.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.460]   He pressed on, but he was still far from the place.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.280]   He began running, threw away his coat, his boots,
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.080]   his flask, and his cap, and kept only the spade,
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.880]   which he used as a support.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.500]   What shall I do, he thought again?
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.260]   I have grasped too much and ruined the whole affair.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.420]   I can't get there before the sun sets.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.700]   And this fear made him still more breathless.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.860]   Pahom went on running.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.180]   His soaking shirt and trousers stuck to him,
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.740]   and his mouth was parched.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.580]   His breast was working like a blacksmith's bellows.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.460]   His heart was beating like a hammer,
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.780]   and his legs were giving way
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.620]   as if they did not belong to him.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.300]   Pahom was seized with terror,
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.720]   lest he should die of the strain.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.900]   Though afraid of death, he could not stop.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.380]   After having run all that way,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.940]   they will call me a fool if I stop now, thought he.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.780]   And he ran on and on, and drew near,
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.340]   and heard the Bashkirs yelling and shouting to him,
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.940]   and their cries inflamed his heart still more.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.800]   He gathered his last strength and ran on.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.420]   The sun was close to the rim,
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.660]   and cloaked in mist looked large and red as blood.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.820]   Now, yes, now it was about to set.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.940]   The sun was quite low, but he was also quite near his aim.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.000]   Pahom could already see the people on the hillock
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.820]   waving their arms to hurry him up.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.220]   He could see the fox fur cap on the ground,
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.260]   and the money on it,
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.180]   and the chief sitting on the ground holding his sides.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.500]   And Pahom remembered his dream.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.460]   "There's plenty of land," thought he.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.100]   "But will God let me live on it?
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.880]   "I've lost my life, I've lost my life.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.300]   "I shall never reach that spot."
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.460]   Pahom looked at the sun, which had reached the earth.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.140]   One side of it had already disappeared.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.220]   With all his remaining strength, he rushed on,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.480]   bending his body forward so that his legs
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.620]   could hardly follow fast enough to keep him from falling.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.980]   Just as he reached the hillock, it suddenly grew dark.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.380]   He looked up.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.820]   The sun had already set.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.380]   He gave a cry.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.420]   "All my labor has been in vain," thought he.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.380]   And it was about to stop.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.460]   But he heard the Bashkirs still shouting,
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.340]   and remember that, though to him from below
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.980]   the sun seemed to have set,
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.220]   they on the hillock could still see it.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.660]   He took a long breath and ran up the hillock.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.940]   It was still light there.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.100]   He reached the top and saw the cap.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.260]   Before it sat the chief laughing and holding his sides.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.340]   Again, Pahom remembered his dream and he uttered a cry.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.020]   His legs gave way beneath him and he fell forward
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.360]   and reached the cap with his hands.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.740]   "Ah, what a fine fellow," exclaimed the chief.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.480]   "He has gained much land."
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.620]   Pahom's servant came running up and tried to raise him,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.660]   but he saw that blood was flowing from his mouth.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.020]   Pahom was dead.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.880]   The Bashkirs clicked their tongues to show their pity.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.860]   His servant picked up the spade and dug a grave
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.300]   long enough for Pahom to lie in and buried him in it.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.440]   Six feet from his head to his heels was all he needed.
