[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.760]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles in Chapter 5, reading verses 38 and 39.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.560]   Now, those words come in this record which is found in this last paragraph in this fifth
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.600]   chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in which we are given an account of the discussion
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.360]   that took place in the great council in Jerusalem called the Sanhedrin.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   The subject of the discussion was, "What should they do with these men who are called
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.280]   apostles, the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ?"
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.320]   In the previous paragraph, we are told of what the apostles had said in their self-defense.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.160]   These men had been arrested and they were charged with this charge, "Did not we straightly
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.720]   commend you that you should not teach in this name, and behold, you have filled Jerusalem
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.440]   with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us?"
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.880]   Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, "We are to obey God rather than
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   men.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.920]   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.080]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, for to give repentance
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.040]   to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.880]   And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.480]   given to them that obey him."
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.400]   Then the story goes on to tell us, "When they heard that," in other words, the members
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.880]   of the council, the Sanhedrin, who heard those words, "they were cut to the heart and took
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.800]   counsel to slay them."
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   Then stood thereupon in the council a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.920]   reputation among all the people, and commended to put the apostles forth a little space,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.540]   and said unto them, "Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.700]   touching these men.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.700]   For before these days rose up Thudas, boasting himself to be somebody, to whom a number of
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.640]   men, about four hundred, joined themselves, who were slain, and all as many as obeyed
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.400]   him were scattered and brought to naught.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.320]   After this men rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.280]   people after him.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.080]   He also perished, and all as many as obeyed him were dispersed.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.840]   And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.960]   For if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught; but if it be of God,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.640]   he cannot overthrow it, lest, haply, he be found even to fight against God."
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720]   And to him they agreed, and when they had called the apostles and beaten them, they
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.640]   commended that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   Now, those who worship here regularly will know that we've been considering this paragraph
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   for the last three Sunday evenings.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.480]   We are working our way through the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.840]   We began at the beginning of January last year, 1965, and we are still working our way
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.720]   through this great book.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.240]   And our reason for doing so is this.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   We take the view that the most urgent and the most important thing in the world today
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   is to know exactly what the Christian message is.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.120]   It's a world in which everything is failing, a world of trouble.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.640]   This century has already had its two world wars.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   We see the great possibilities confronting us.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.880]   All the ability and the ingenuity of statesmen, philosophers, thinkers, doesn't seem to
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   avail.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.280]   So, as Christians, we say that there is only one hope, and that is this gospel.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   But there's great confusion about this, as to what it is, as to what the church is
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.080]   about, how this gospel is to be preached.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.400]   All these things are today in a state of utter confusion.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.960]   So we are studying this book of Acts in order that we may find out exactly how all this
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.680]   began.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.800]   It isn't what we think about it in the twentieth century that matters.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.840]   What we must discover is how it began.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.400]   What is this thing?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.240]   What gave it origin and being?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.960]   How did it spread and succeed?
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.160]   And here is the only authentic account we have of that, and that is why we are considering
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   it together.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.360]   Now then, we have arrived at this point.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.720]   And we've arrived also at Whitsunday evening.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.840]   Whitsunday, what's it mean?
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   What is it?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.440]   Oh, it's a festival in the church.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.720]   But what is it?
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.280]   Why should the church regard it as a day of festival, a day of memorial?
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.360]   What's the meaning of all this?
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.400]   Now, I want to consider that with you.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:12.080]   And I want to do so particularly in terms of this statement that was made by Gamaliel.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.240]   You see, he puts it like this.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   If this work be of men, it will come to nothing, to naught.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.360]   But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.360]   And indeed, you will be found even to fight against God.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.200]   Now there, Gamaliel puts the question very well.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.680]   A fortnight ago, I think it was, we were considering the case of Gamaliel himself.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   And we saw his serious lacks and deficiencies, this man who looks so all right on the surface,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.640]   but who in the end is really as blind to the truth as the more irate and vociferous members
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   of the Sanhedrin.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640]   He is blind.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.400]   He doesn't see it.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.960]   However, what he does do, and which we can take advantage of, is to put up this case.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.520]   And the question he raises, you see, for us is this.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.000]   How can you tell whether a work is the work of God or the work of men?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.720]   That's the question that Gamaliel raised.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.000]   And however deficient he was himself in his understanding and his insight, he certainly
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.140]   puts a very good question.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.440]   And that's the question that I want to consider with you.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.560]   What is the relationship of this to Whitsunday?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.200]   Well, it is this.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.440]   On that first Whitsunday in Jerusalem, a very remarkable thing happened.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   This incident that we are considering would never have taken place were it not for that
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.760]   which had happened on the day of Pentecost, as it was called, which we now call Whitsunday.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   What was it?
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.800]   Well, you can read it for yourselves, and I exhort you to do so.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.880]   Go home and read these early chapters of the book of the Acts tonight or tomorrow or whenever
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.200]   you have real time and pleasure and read what you find here.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.520]   And it comes to this.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:16.040]   There had appeared suddenly in Palestine a young teacher called Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.560]   At the age of thirty he began to preach and to teach and to work miracles.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.680]   And he became a phenomenon.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.040]   He'd been known to some people as a carpenter working in a little place called Nazareth
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.720]   up in Galilee.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.120]   But suddenly at the age of thirty he goes out in this public ministry and astounds everybody.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.720]   He'd never been trained, he had no learning, and yet he speaks with authority.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.800]   He obviously understands in depth in a way that the Pharisees and scribes had never done.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   Moreover, he worked miracles and he became, as I say, a phenomenon.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.040]   But at the end of three years, as the result of the machinations and plotting of the Pharisees
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.760]   and scribes and Sadducees and Herodians and all these other people and the Roman authority,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.720]   he was arrested, he was condemned most unjustly, and he was nailed to a tree.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.680]   He was crucified.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.680]   And he died.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.080]   They took down his body and they put it in a grave.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.120]   But this is the point.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.680]   He rose from that grave.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.840]   Now during his ministry he'd collected a number of people around him, and in particular
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.920]   twelve men who were called his disciples and later called apostles.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:34.440]   These men, when they saw him arrested in apparent weakness and saw him dying and dead on that
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.880]   cross, they were completely shattered.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.680]   And they were honest enough to admit it.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.760]   All their hopes were dashed.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.840]   They didn't know what to do.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   But suddenly he appears before them.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.120]   Some of their own company reported how the grave where he'd been buried was empty.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   The stone that had been rolled over, it had been rolled away, and the grave was empty.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.680]   And then he suddenly appears amongst them and does so several times for forty days.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.440]   And he instructs them, he explains everything to them.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   And then in the presence of some of them on another mountain called Olivet, he suddenly
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.280]   ascends into the heavens as they were watching him.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.360]   But before he had done that, he had told them to go back to Jerusalem and to wait, that
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.280]   a mighty thing was going to happen to them a few days hence, that they were going to
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.880]   be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   They were going to be filled with power.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.680]   He says, "Go back and wait, you shall be filled with power, you shall be given power,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.920]   and shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Samaria, and unto the ends of the earth."
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.200]   Well they went back to Jerusalem.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.440]   And there they went on waiting and praying for ten days.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.560]   Then we are told in this dramatic account that is given at the beginning of the second
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.440]   chapter of the book of Acts what happened.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.880]   When the day of Pentecost was fully come, that's to say when Whitsunday had arrived,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.680]   they were all with one accord in one place.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   Listen.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.320]   And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.040]   And it filled the house where they were sitting.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.560]   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.800]   And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.820]   Spirit gave them utterance.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.700]   This created a great sensation.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.120]   People came crowding together to see what this was, this extraordinary phenomenon that
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.160]   these ignorant men could be heard speaking to them in their own dialects and languages
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.240]   the wonderful works of God.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.120]   The crowd was utterly confounded and confused, couldn't understand it.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.040]   Peter got up and began to explain to them.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.200]   And he told them that what had happened was this, that the Jesus they had crucified was
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   the Son of God.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.520]   He had risen from the dead.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.240]   That was the proof that he was the Son of God.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.440]   And now having risen and having gone back to heaven, says Peter, he has sent down this,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.240]   which you see and hear, the Holy Ghost, upon them and upon the company that were gathered
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.480]   together with them in the upper room.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.200]   And then Peter goes on to show them the enormity of their crime in crucifying this Son of God,
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.440]   this Savior.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.640]   And as the result of that sermon, three thousand people believed the message and were converted
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.840]   and were added to the company.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.280]   Then we read in the next chapter how two of these men were going up to the temple to pray
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.280]   one day.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.560]   They saw a man sitting on the pavement outside one of the gates of entry, a man who had been
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.360]   born lame, over forty years of age.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.760]   Peter and John look at him and say, "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   and walk."
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.120]   And he immediately sprang to his feet.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.040]   And his feet and ankle bones received strength.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.240]   And in a minute there he is going into the temple walking and leaping and praising God.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.920]   Well, of course, this created a great excitement.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.520]   And it very much annoyed the Jewish authorities, the religious authorities and the others.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.800]   And they arrested Peter and John, two of these apostles, put them on trial.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.880]   You read the account of the trial in the fourth chapter of this book of Acts, and you read
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.640]   what Peter said to them in defense.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.320]   And then they decided, "Well, we'll let them go, but we'll tell them very plainly that
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   they must stop preaching in this man's name, this Jesus."
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   Peter tells them, it's all very well for them to say that, but he's not influenced or affected
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   by this.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.600]   And it's not whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.560]   God judge you.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.040]   For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   So out they went and told the company they prayed together.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.840]   And the Holy Spirit came down again upon them and shook the very building where they were
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.960]   gathered together.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.080]   And they began to preach more than ever with boldness and authority and power.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.720]   The result of this was, and the many miracles which they wrought, that again the authorities
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.320]   were infuriated and they arrested the whole company of the apostles, pushed them into
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.560]   prison, the innermost prison.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.000]   But they escaped from there.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.040]   They were set free in a miraculous manner, went back again to the temple, went on with
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.160]   their preaching.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.000]   So they were arrested again.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.240]   And that's the story which we have before us this evening.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   They're on trial.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.120]   I've read to you what Peter says in their defense.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.940]   And now we are considering the reaction of the Salesians.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.680]   But here's the question.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.080]   People focus their attention upon it.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.880]   What is this?
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.320]   Is this what the apostles say it is?
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:43.280]   They say that all they're doing is the result of the Holy Spirit which has come upon them,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.880]   which this Jesus has sent upon them.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.040]   We are his witnesses of these things.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.800]   So is also the Holy Spirit whom God has given to them that obey him.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.080]   They say this is a work of God, the work of God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.160]   The others obviously think it isn't.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.720]   That's why they want to kill them.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.760]   Gamaliel holds the balance, as it were, and puts the question, is it a work of God or
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.480]   isn't it a work of God?
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.960]   That's the question I want to discuss with you.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.200]   How can you tell whether a thing is the work of God or not?
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.160]   "Dear me," says somebody, "why do you ask us to consider such a question?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.200]   Is that a relevant question to our situation in the world today?
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.080]   Are you just propounding to us some old question, perhaps of interest to you preachers who've
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.440]   got nothing else to do, but just sit and read books and discuss things like this?
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.560]   What's that got to do with me?"
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.920]   I'll tell you, my friend.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.160]   This is something that has this to do with you.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.640]   This is something that determines your life in this world and in the next.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.760]   That's why I say this is the most important thing in the world this evening.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.240]   Is this the work of God or isn't it?
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.680]   Our whole eternal destiny depends upon our answer to that question.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.960]   Very well, then, the question that is before us is this.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.360]   How can you tell that?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.260]   Are the apostles right or are the members of the Sanhedrin right?
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.960]   How can you tell the difference between these two things?
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.040]   What are the authentic marks of a work of the Spirit of God?
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.520]   That's the thing we must discover.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.360]   Now, then, let's try and deal with this.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:35.400]   Let me start by saying that obviously it's not always easy to tell the difference.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.120]   There would have been no perplexity on the part of a man like Amaliel if the thing was
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   plain and obvious and simple.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.480]   It isn't simple.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.920]   Our Lord himself gives me authority for saying this.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.520]   Listen to this in Matthew 24, 24.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:16:00.460]   For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:08.000]   insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.880]   Those are the words of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.720]   So you see, it's not easy.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.120]   False Christs, false prophets.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.080]   The New Testament is full of this kind of thing.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.220]   It caused great trouble in the life of the early church.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.960]   Not only are there false Christs and false prophets, there are what are called the great
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.040]   world religions.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.160]   Are they of God?
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.360]   Are they on an equality with this?
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.680]   There are many works, you see, that claim to be something.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.360]   Take the cults that are round and about us at the present time.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.800]   Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Science, many others.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.440]   Here are all claiming allegiance, offering to do something for mankind.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.720]   They use the name of God.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.160]   How can we tell whether a thing that claims to be a work of God is in reality a work of
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.720]   God?
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.840]   This is the problem that confronts us and we've got to face it.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:20.200]   Now sometimes this problem is unusually difficult, and it's at its most difficult in these
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:29.880]   circumstances when there is an element of truth in it, and when Christianity is involved
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.040]   in a kind of essential sense.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.520]   How can you tell the difference therefore between the true and the false?
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.560]   Now this has been a very great problem throughout the centuries.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.600]   It has been a great problem to the Christian church herself.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.040]   If you know anything about the history of revivals in the story of the church, you will
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.240]   know that this problem has very, very frequently arisen.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.040]   And it arises in this way.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:06.520]   There is a powerful influence in this world called the devil, the head of the evil spirits.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.880]   Now this is not my idea.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.960]   This is the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.640]   The apostle Paul puts it like this, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.120]   principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.440]   spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places."
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.000]   Indeed it's the whole message of the whole Bible, that an antagonist has arisen against
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.240]   God, a mighty power, a fallen angel called the devil, with great forces, and his supreme
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.080]   ambition is always to spoil the work of God.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.900]   He did it in the first creation.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.800]   He does his utmost to do it in connection with the life of the church, which is the
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.720]   second or the new creation.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.760]   And what he does of course is this, is to try to confuse the work of God.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.080]   He tries to bring in a human element into it.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   And thereby he has often driven people to excesses, and often has brought genuine revivals
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   into disrepute.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.320]   I mustn't stay with this, but it's important we should know this as a background.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.360]   This is what makes this problem sometimes very difficult.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:17.160]   Now there was a great man in the United States two hundred years ago called Jonathan Edwards.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.240]   In many ways the most brilliant thinker that the United States has ever produced, certainly
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.000]   one of our greatest saints.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.560]   Jonathan Edwards was involved in a great religious awakening revival.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.160]   But he saw, he was a man with a spiritual mind and he knew his scriptures, he saw that
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.000]   another element was always tending to come in, the devil would take hold of certain men
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.760]   and use them and their natural abilities and their ambitions, and the work of the spirit
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.080]   of God was being confused.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.280]   So Jonathan Edwards wrote a great book which is called his Treatise on the Nature of Religious
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:02.080]   Affections, in which he shows us the difference between the true and the false.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.680]   It's not easy, it's very difficult, but I say we must be certain of these things, because
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.400]   so much depends upon our realizing the difference between the two things.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.960]   Very well, how can we tell?
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.320]   Let me suggest in the second place therefore that there are certain tests which are quite
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.440]   inadequate to apply, inadequate tests.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.200]   People often get confused by these because they think that they're adequate.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.040]   What am I referring to?
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.600]   Well the first I must use is this.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:44.240]   The fact that in a work Christian phraseology and terminology is being used is not a guarantee
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.120]   that it is a work of the spirit of God.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.760]   Now that again I could demonstrate easily from the story of revivals.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.800]   Obviously the people who brought in the false element two hundred years ago in America,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.840]   they were using the Christian terms and phraseology.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.640]   Indeed, hasn't that been the whole tragedy of this present century in the Christian church?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.740]   The so-called higher criticism which has come in and undermined the authority of the scriptures,
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.320]   they haven't stopped using the terms.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:19.000]   They talk about Christ as savior, but they don't mean by that what you and I mean and
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.040]   what the church has meant throughout the centuries and what the apostles meant.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.280]   They use the term but they evacuate the meaning.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.480]   They hold on to the phraseology, but the truth has gone.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.440]   So I say the test is not are they using Christian terms and phraseology.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.680]   Are they talking about the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.520]   Are they talking about the death on his cross?
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.200]   Yes, they may do all that and still it may be the work of men and not the work of God.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.520]   That's not sufficient.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   What else?
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:55.840]   Well, secondly, success and popularity are not a criterion.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.520]   The fact that they gain adherence doesn't prove that it's of God.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.160]   False movements can gain adherence.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.520]   There ought to be no difficulty about this.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.200]   Buddhism is very popular.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.240]   Did you know that there's been a mass movement in the direction of Buddhism in Ceylon during
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.760]   this last ten years?
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.960]   A mass movement.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.760]   Buddhism is successful, popular again, gains adherence.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.440]   So are many other religions and movements.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.720]   I mentioned the cults already.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   Think of them again.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.480]   Think of the success of Mohammedanism.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.400]   So you see the fact that a movement is successful and popular and that it gains adherence and
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:44.040]   results doesn't prove that it is of necessity a true work of the Spirit of God.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:51.400]   Thirdly, the fact that a teaching or a method may give people help doesn't prove that it
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.600]   is a work of the Spirit of God.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.320]   The cults would never succeed if that were so.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.640]   Why do people become adherents of the cults?
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.160]   Obviously, they seem to find help in the cults.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.760]   I've known many such people.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.320]   You can read the testimonies of people who've become Christian scientists and others, and
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.360]   they'll tell you of the marvellous difference it's made to them.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.040]   Now then, the fact that people are helped and that they're made to feel better and happier,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.720]   that they can sleep where as formerly they suffered from insomnia or that they've got
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.000]   healing in their body, it doesn't prove that the work is of the Spirit of God.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.080]   The cults can do that.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.160]   The counterfeit can produce this, even as our Lord reminded us there in that quotation
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.080]   I gave you from Matthew 24, 24.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:41.200]   In the same way, the presence of phenomena, unusual phenomena, doesn't prove that a work
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.080]   is a genuine work of the Spirit of God.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.280]   False movements have their phenomena.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:54.440]   Our Lord taught there again that these false Christs will be able to work signs and wonders
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:00.200]   of such a startling character as almost to deceive the very elect themselves.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.800]   We mustn't dispute facts, my friends.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   There is a well-known spiritist or spiritualist in this country, and undoubtedly he gets healing
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   results.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.080]   There's nothing wrong in a Christian minister saying that from a pulpit.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.960]   You've got to face facts.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.160]   Mr. Harry Edwards gets results.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160]   He's a spiritist.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.760]   He says he's the medium of Louis Pasteur.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.200]   But you can't dispute facts.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.440]   They're there.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   Tongues.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   Mormons speak in tongues.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.040]   Spiritualists speak in tongues.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   People under psychological influences can speak in tongues and do so.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.880]   So you see, the presence of phenomena is not a proof that a work is a genuine work of the
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.800]   Spirit of God.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.360]   What about zeal and enthusiasm in the followers?
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.200]   Sure, you say, this is an absolute proof.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Is it?
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:55.280]   Are not the followers of the cults zealous in their propaganda?
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.240]   Why I've had them at my own door on a Saturday afternoon, young men and women, giving up
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.000]   their Saturday afternoon to come round trying to sell their literature.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.360]   They'll give their time, they'll give their money, they'll give their energy.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.840]   Some of them are ready to give their very lives.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.720]   You're familiar with this with some other religions in exactly the same way.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:21.240]   So zeal and enthusiasm in the followers and a concern to teach others and to proselytize
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.840]   others, it doesn't prove that the work that has taken place in them is a work, a true
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   and a genuine work of the Spirit of God.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.960]   And lastly, I would say this.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.400]   This test that is propounded by Gamaliel is not a good one.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.800]   Gamaliel, you see, puts it like this.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.660]   He says, "If this counsel of this work be of men, it will come to naught.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.680]   But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it."
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.560]   He says, "If a thing lasts, it must be of God."
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.280]   He's quite wrong.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.840]   Confucianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Mohammedanism have lasted for centuries.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.480]   The false teaching of Roman Catholicism didn't immediately collapse when it had departed
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   from the Scripture.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.280]   No, no, this is not a good test.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.520]   There is an element of truth in it, but if you base your position upon that, well then
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.800]   I say you'll be in difficulties when you come to answer the various critics who appear
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.240]   before you and who want to test your Christian faith.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.280]   Those appear to be good tests, but they're not reliable, they're inadequate.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.320]   Very well, says somebody, what are you suggesting are the true tests?
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.080]   Well let me put it like this to you.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:36.280]   Let's have a look at the characteristic of a work of man, and then let's contrast it
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.840]   with a work of God.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.480]   Here it is, it always comes back to this.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:49.560]   If this work be of men, if it be of God.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.360]   Now let's try to look at this thing as dispassionately as we can.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.200]   My dear friends, I say again there is nothing more important than this.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.280]   We can be deluded, we can be deceived.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.680]   The devil deceived Adam and Eve at the beginning, and he's continued to deceive people through
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.280]   the running centuries.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.800]   If he can get us to espouse the false, he's delighted.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.960]   It's one of the best ways of keeping us from the truth.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:23.360]   And as Paul reminds us, he can even transform himself into an angel of light and quote scripture
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.600]   and appear to be a fine Christian in order to delude us and mislead us.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:34.280]   Very well, what are the characteristics, the tests of the work of man?
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.360]   I suggest there's something like this.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.480]   First of all, there's a very general test which seems to me to be a very important one.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.960]   If you can understand the work, if you can explain the work, you can be certain that
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.160]   it is the work of men.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:28:00.080]   And there are many works of men which appear to be truly the work of God, which can be
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.200]   understood and seen through by the application of this test alone.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.680]   I mean by that that if you see a work and you feel that you can explain it quite simply
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.880]   and adequately in psychological terms, well then you're right in doing so.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.040]   Now this is a test that you apply in the same way to miracles.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.880]   There are some people who seem to think that miracles are happening by the thousand every
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.880]   day.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   By definition that's wrong.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   A miracle is something exceptional.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.760]   How do you tell whether a thing is a miracle or not?
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.640]   Well, one of the best tests I think is this one.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.160]   If you can explain the thing that has happened in some sort of scientific terms, you can
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.000]   be sure it isn't a miracle.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.260]   A miracle is supernatural.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.960]   It is beyond the natural.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.860]   It is beyond understanding, therefore.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.600]   If you can explain a thing, well do so.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.800]   I plead with Christians especially to do this.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.120]   Don't claim things to be miraculous if they can be explained in natural terms.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.320]   And it's the same with this kind of general movement in connection with religion or with
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.360]   the Christian faith.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.320]   If you can see what is happening, if you can see that it's a psychological influence either
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:15.640]   upon an individual or upon a mass, there is such a thing as mass or mob psychology.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   We're all aware of this.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.920]   Unfortunately Hitler has taught us all about this.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.360]   Look at, do you remember those people and do you remember hearing their shouting and
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.600]   you may have seen films of them since.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.720]   The power that that man could exercise upon that mob.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.920]   They were worked up with singing and with bends beforehand and then his particular type
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   of oratory.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.040]   He could do anything he liked with them and they were ready to die for him.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.160]   They were enthusiastic, they were zealous.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.520]   It was all the result of his brilliant psychological technique.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:50.880]   A magnetic personality to start with who knows how to use and to employ a psychological technique
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.040]   and you read of many freak religions and you can easily see what's happening.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.760]   Have you seen some of them on the television?
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.000]   I'm saying all these things because there are men who are writing books about this trying
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.680]   to discredit Christianity and every time they appear on the television this is the sort
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   of thing they'll do.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.840]   They'll give you pictures of freak religions in South America or somewhere, people with
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.000]   snakes and so on.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Well it's obvious that those poor people are just under a psychological influence.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.200]   You can see it happening.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.640]   You can see it being gradually worked up until they don't know where they are.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.440]   The explanation is perfectly simple.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.720]   It's entirely psychological.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.880]   Now I say therefore that this is a very good test.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.760]   If you're confronted by something and you're not quite clear as to what it is, put that
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   test.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   Can I understand this?
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.480]   Do I see what's happening?
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.580]   Can I explain this?
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.240]   If you can, it's probably just the work of men.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   We all need to apply these things.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.620]   Every one of us, every preacher of the gospel's got to examine himself constantly along the
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.960]   this very line.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:05.520]   Secondly, take up the question of methods in connection with any movement.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.600]   And you will find if it's men's work that men's activity is always the most prominent
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   element.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.920]   You'll see men's activity.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.080]   You'll see it in his organization, in everything.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.760]   Now take that word that we read together out of the fourth chapter of the book of the prophet
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:31.920]   Zechariah, "not by might, not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord."
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   Might.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   What's might?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.320]   Well, there's nothing more powerful than money, is there?
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.560]   Money, influence, organization, that's power.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.960]   Money is power.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.480]   Might and power.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.320]   It's always prominent in the work of men.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.480]   He relies upon it, obviously.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   He's got to.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.440]   He can't succeed without it.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.400]   He manipulates power.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.340]   And when it is the work of men, the power of man is always very prominent and outstanding.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.880]   And in the same way, man has his methods, he has his techniques, and obviously he's
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.720]   got to rely a good deal on these things.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.520]   You will see these things, you can read about them in books.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.800]   You'll see how certain men, sometimes even claiming to preach the gospel, but really
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.520]   preaching nothing but psychology, they've had their results, they've had their adherence,
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.520]   people have almost worshipped them.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.520]   How have they done it?
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.960]   Well, sometimes they've even done it by manipulating electric lights.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.600]   Different colored lights, a cross perhaps illuminated on the central light, and as the
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.040]   service goes on, lights slowly go out at given points, until at the end you're in almost
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.720]   darkness and just looking at this one thing and the preacher under it.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   These are the techniques of psychology with which we are all familiar.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.120]   Then the value of repetition.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.720]   You do the same thing and you keep on doing it and you repeat it.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.120]   This is elementary to anybody who knows anything about psychology and all the realm of hypnotism
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.440]   and things like that.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.040]   The value of repetition and suggestion and you go on and you go on and you on.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.280]   Now in the work of men, all that is evident and it's prominent.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.920]   One can't get results without doing this sort of thing.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.800]   And the other characteristic as regards methods is that there is always a great deal of pressure
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:29.080]   brought upon people, some way or another to break them down and to convince them and to
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.800]   gain them as adherents.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.240]   Muhammad of course is the striking example of this.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.240]   He actually did it at the point of the sword.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   Muhammad made people believe his message at the point of the sword.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.720]   He took armies, he thought he was right in doing it.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.040]   He said this is truth, what I'm preaching is right.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.120]   I'm going to make people believe it.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.560]   Well that's the extreme.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   But that's always the method of men.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.840]   He will bring pressure to bear in every way that he can to get people to a decision immediately
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.800]   in order that he has his results.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.280]   Now this is a part of men's method, technique.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:10.040]   Human endeavor, human pressure brought to bear upon people.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.520]   But what are the characteristics of this work of men?
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:20.200]   Well as I'm saying, its outstanding characteristic always is that it is man-centered.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.960]   The male is two examples illustrate that.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.920]   Theodos, Judas, it's the same with all others.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   A man is always prominent, a man is always at the center.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.760]   But not only that, watch the message and you'll find that it always starts with men and ends
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.320]   with men.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:45.000]   It always is interested in men's needs, men's problems, men's difficulties.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.920]   That's the thing he's always talking about.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.080]   Now take the cults for instance.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.400]   The cults would never succeed and flourish if they didn't do this.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.720]   They know there's a lot of suffering in the world and that people are in trouble.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.320]   So they come and say, "Are you in trouble?
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.320]   Are you worried?
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.560]   Do you find it difficult to sleep?
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.400]   Are you a ditherer?
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.300]   Are you conscious of some aches or pains or some kind of paralysis?
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.480]   Now come along," they say, "we can put you right, we can deal with you.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.560]   That's what we are here for.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.760]   This is our message."
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.160]   You see, they start with men and his needs and his desires and they offer him the benefits
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.640]   that he stands in need of.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.000]   It's man-centered the whole time.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Everything is for man.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Man's the great being at the center and all agencies are here to help man.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.580]   Man is at the center of it all.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:40.400]   And the other characteristic of course is the superficiality of men's work always.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.560]   Men's incapable of profundity.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.800]   And you will find that a work which is a work of men, though it may appear at times to be
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:54.160]   the work of God, is superficial in its intellectual content.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.200]   It's a part of its success that it is.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.600]   I'll show you the contrast in a moment.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.400]   It's not only superficial in its intellectual content, it's even superficial in its emotional
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400]   content.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:15.160]   Now this is very interesting, this emotional aspect, because sometimes it goes from one
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.080]   extreme to another.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:24.400]   Sometimes the emotion is riotous, violent, obviously irrational.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.000]   Emotionalism.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.280]   But you know, sometimes it's the exact opposite.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.080]   It's sentimentalism.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.600]   Now these are two extremes.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.560]   Neither of them is true emotion.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.320]   Sentimentalism is quiet and it's respectable.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.520]   And it's never in any way obtrusive or offensive.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.520]   That's sentimentalism.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   Sentimentalism, wild emotionalism.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:55.040]   I'll show you the contrast in a moment with the truth.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.420]   And in the same way as I say, the characteristic of these human movements is that they generally
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.240]   make an onslaught upon the will.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.040]   A direct attack and appeal to the will.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:15.360]   And the result of all this is that their effects are generally not lasting.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360]   It's a temporary effect.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   Well, why?
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.400]   Well, because, of course, it's dependent upon what man is doing and man's manipulation.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.680]   Shall I tell you a story?
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.840]   Forgive me for telling you this out of my own experience.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   To illustrate what I'm saying.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.160]   Before I came here I was in a church in South Wales.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.060]   It was a much smaller building than this.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.460]   And I used to go and stand at the door of exit at the inn to shake hands with people
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.000]   as they went out.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.680]   I used to be preaching there and I used to notice every Sunday night a man on the gallery.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   We all knew him well.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   He was a butcher.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   Poor fellow.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.760]   He used to be drunk every Saturday night.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.120]   But he always came to our service Sunday night.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.320]   And I remember one particular Sunday night while I was preaching I happened to look at
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.680]   the man and I could see the tears were streaming down his face.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.120]   "Hello," I thought, "is it happening to him tonight?"
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.880]   However, I went to the door at the end and this man came along.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.280]   For a moment I felt to myself, "Now, shall I challenge this man?"
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.000]   I decided not to.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   I shook him by the hand as usual and prayed that God would bless him.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.080]   Out he went.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   Next night I was walking up to my prayer meeting and who was coming to meet me but this very
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.600]   man?
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.800]   He came on to me and said, "You know, Doctor, if you'd asked me to stay behind last night
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   I'd have done so."
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.120]   I said, "Well, I'm asking you now."
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.360]   "Oh, no, no," he said, "if you'd asked me last night I'd have stayed behind.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   I'd have joined the church."
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   "Well," I said, "come along.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   Come with me now.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   I'm going to a prayer meeting."
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.280]   "No, no," he said, "I'd have done it last night."
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:45.600]   I said, "My dear friend, if what happened to you last night doesn't last 24 hours, it
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.480]   is not the work of the Spirit of God."
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.480]   It was emotionalism.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.000]   Perhaps I was partly responsible.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.440]   Perhaps I'd been doing something that I shouldn't have done in the presentation of this Gospel.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:03.820]   A work that doesn't last 24 hours is not the work of the Spirit of God.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:09.200]   It is a temporary influence, a superficial influence upon the mind or the conscience
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.800]   or the heart or upon the will.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.000]   Now you've had this always in some of the great revivals of history.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.400]   There have always been what are called temporary believers, people as it were washed up onto
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   the shore by the movement.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.480]   They don't last.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.080]   They seem to be all right, but no, no, it was only temporary.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.040]   When the influence goes, when the stimulus has ceased, they've got nothing.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.480]   It was all a superficial work.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.320]   They were only kept going as long as they belonged to a certain atmosphere.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.080]   Now there's been a great deal of this in this present century.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.560]   I have known certain movements in this country.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.960]   I have known students, members of universities.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.600]   While they were still up at the university and having to go to a daily prayer meeting
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.680]   or some regular meeting of their evangelical unions, they appear to be wonderful Christians.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.280]   They finish their university course, they go back and out into the world, they've got
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.800]   nothing.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.240]   Once they go out of the atmosphere that had carried them along, they've got nothing.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.880]   That's the work of men.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.480]   Men can do a great deal, but the work of men, you see, in this sense, it doesn't really
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.200]   last, it doesn't continue.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.440]   Religions of the world I've mentioned, they continue.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   Why?
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   Well, because it's fear.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:25.280]   It's a religion of fear and the tyranny of fear.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.320]   Very well, there are the characteristics of men's work.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.560]   What are the characteristics of God's work?
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.840]   What a relief that we can turn to this.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.600]   It's here before us in the early chapters of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:45.520]   You can see it in every revival that has ever taken place in the history of the world.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520]   What are the characteristics?
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.320]   Let me apply my same test.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   What about the general test?
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   Here's the first.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:57.920]   A work of the Spirit of God is always inexplicable.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.520]   You cannot explain it.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.160]   Did you notice that word at the beginning of Acts 2?
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.280]   Sudden, sudden.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:13.400]   No preparation, no conditioning, no working up to, no, no, sudden.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:19.000]   It happens to them, and it's inexplicable.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.200]   Revivals, movements of the Spirit of God, take place in spite of human weakness, never
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.560]   worked up by men.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.720]   I've known many men who've tried to work up revivals.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.440]   It can never be done.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.800]   They say you do this, that, and the other, you'll get a revival.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.160]   You will not.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.880]   Revival is always from God, and it's amazing.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.760]   It always has this effect that it had upon the people of Jerusalem.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   What meaneth this?
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.760]   What is this?
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.040]   You can't understand it.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.160]   You can't explain it.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.040]   Your psychologists try to explain it, but they cannot.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.720]   I had the privilege of answering the book of Dr. William Sargent a few years back,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.400]   "Battle for the Mind."
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:09.000]   I was privileged to write a reply to him, "Conversion Psychological and Spiritual."
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.640]   And he couldn't answer me, because he couldn't explain them.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.400]   I was able to show how all that he was explaining was not applicable here.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.800]   He couldn't explain the day of Pentecost.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.640]   He couldn't explain the origin of a single revival, and still less could he explain why
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.880]   they suddenly stop.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   He couldn't explain why, when men have used all the techniques, they've never produced
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   a revival.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.880]   They cannot.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.880]   It's the work of God.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.440]   It's always surprising.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:42.040]   It always eludes human ingenuity and human understanding.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.480]   That's a great test, that.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.160]   But come to the second, the methods.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:56.420]   Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.960]   No human might, no human power.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.520]   This doesn't depend upon man's ability in organizing or in anything else, or in special
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.520]   techniques.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.440]   Not at all.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.960]   It doesn't depend upon human pressure being applied to the will or to anything else.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.440]   Now, let me give you my authority for saying all this.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.560]   You see, we're fortunate in having the great Apostle Paul as the basis for what we are
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   saying.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.560]   Listen to this.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.520]   Here he's writing to the Corinthians in the first epistle in the second chapter.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:31.560]   "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.280]   declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:42.400]   For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:53.960]   And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, self-confident, the
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.440]   exact opposite.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:02.360]   Weakness, fear, much trembling, and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:07.840]   of men's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith should
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.400]   not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.920]   And did you notice what we read together at the beginning from that first epistle to the
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.400]   Thessalonians and the second chapter?
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.440]   Those verses that we read there, verses three to six, the whole thing is quite plain.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.520]   "Our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile, but as we were
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.720]   allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.600]   Not us pleasing men, but God which trieth our hearts.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:44.880]   For neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness,
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.680]   God is witness, nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.160]   might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ."
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   My dear friend, that's invariable.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:03.000]   The apostle Paul deliberately decided not to use his human abilities and powers.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.600]   I determined not to know anything among you.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.240]   This was a brilliant man.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.420]   Here was a man who could have argued philosophy.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.080]   Here was a man who could have brought his mighty logic to bear.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.560]   He could have done all this, and he could have been rhetorical and eloquent when he
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.560]   wanted to.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.200]   He proves that in his epistles.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.120]   He deliberately eschews it.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.840]   He says, "I put it aside.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.360]   I wanted it to be clear that it was of God and not of men."
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.880]   He didn't try to get at them, and please them, and flatter them, and put them into
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.360]   a good mood, and joke and laugh with them, and entertain them.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.280]   No, no, it's inconceivable.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.000]   He wants it to be seen it's nothing but the power of the Spirit of the living God.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.760]   He deliberately did this in order that the marks of the work of God might be perfectly
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.140]   plain and clear, and you know when it's the Spirit of God acting, there is no need
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.440]   of men to use his power.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.080]   Look at Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.520]   He's expounding scriptures.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:05.120]   It seems to be a dull sermon as you read him going on, but this is what I read.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.040]   Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:16.160]   the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.280]   Perhaps you see the work of the Spirit of God.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.560]   It doesn't rely upon human methods and techniques.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:26.880]   It's the Spirit searching minds and hearts and consciences and dealing with them, and
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.960]   they cry out.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.280]   There was a revival in the Congo.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   When was it?
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   Some twelve years or so ago.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.080]   There was a chapter in it written by a man called Ivor Davies.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.160]   He came back to this country and spoke afterwards.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.880]   I'll never forget what he said.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.760]   This is what he told us had happened in the revival.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.920]   He'd been a missionary in the Congo for twenty years, and he said, "I preached my heart
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.680]   out and I pleaded with people to come forward in decision at the end.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   Not a soul came."
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.720]   He said, "I was almost breaking my heart."
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.720]   He'd gone away somewhere.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.040]   While he was away, a revival broke out.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.640]   He said, "This is what I found.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.800]   I went back and I began to preach.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.080]   Halfway through my sermon, people began coming forward, wanting help in agony of soul."
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.280]   He'd been trying to do it.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.300]   Nothing happened.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.480]   He wasn't able to do this.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.880]   He wasn't an expert in the psychological method.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.360]   But when the spirit of God comes down, they cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall we
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.640]   do?
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.080]   What must I do to be saved?"
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   The spirit does it.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.040]   So it's not dependent upon man's methods.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:35.280]   I determined not to know anything among you, not with enticing words of man's wisdom.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.240]   In demonstration of the spirit and of power, what are its characteristics?
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.480]   Oh, here they are.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.160]   I said the characteristic of man's work is its superficiality.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.720]   What's the characteristic of this?
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   Read your Bible.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.600]   Read your New Testament, my dear people, and you'll be impressed by the greatness, the
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.560]   glory, the majesty.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.600]   Truth is in control.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   What else?
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.760]   Tremendous seriousness.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:12.560]   Read these early chapters of Acts and keep your eye on the word "fear" and on the word
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.840]   "all."
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.880]   You know when God is present, there is a sense of awe.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.040]   Our God is a consuming fire.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.720]   And when God the Spirit is present, there is a profound seriousness.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.080]   Man is out of sight.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.240]   God is filling the place.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.960]   And his glory and his truth and his majesty are so evident that there is a sense of awe,
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.880]   a tremendous seriousness, a profundity.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.000]   That's the general characteristic.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And what of the message?
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.880]   Well, it never starts with man.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.960]   Always starts with God.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.840]   You notice how Peter puts it here on this occasion?
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.000]   We ought to obey God rather than men.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   What's the message?
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.400]   Does he get up and say, "Now let us go on preaching.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.800]   We are helping people very much.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.400]   We are making them much happier than they were."
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.400]   Not at all.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   Listen.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.360]   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.400]   The true message is always a message that starts with God.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.440]   Not with man and his aches and pains and his little unhappinesses and his problems, his
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.640]   psychological states and conditions.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   No, no.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:27.400]   But man face to face with God, the everlasting and eternal God, his honor, his glory, his
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:36.560]   majesty, and it's concerned about his great plan and scheme and purpose of redemption
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.640]   and of salvation.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:46.200]   The Bible is interested in sin not because it makes us unhappy, but because it is an
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:54.080]   affront of God, because it's rebellion, because it's arrogance before a holy God.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.560]   We are self-subjective, self-centered, always interested in ourselves, wanting something
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.560]   for ourselves.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.840]   My dear friend, the first thing you need to know is this, that you are under God and that
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.200]   he's there and his glory is the thing that matters.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.240]   Whatever may be true about you and me, it always starts like that.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:16.000]   And the result is, of course, that there is always very prominent in a true work of the
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.640]   Spirit of God what the fathers used to call a law work.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   What do they mean by that?
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.320]   Well, they meant this.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:31.680]   The true work always humbles men, abases him.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.720]   It always convicts him of sin.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.400]   He forgets his little troubles and his problems.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.200]   He sees himself as a sinner.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.920]   Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.560]   Conscious of God, conscious of his Son, conscious of the vileness in us that made us reject
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.440]   him, this is the thing we are humbled, we are smashed, we are convicted of sin.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:51:00.040]   We are driven to repentance and we become concerned about our souls.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.240]   Even though we may have to go on being ill physically, even though we go on suffering
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.640]   from the insomnia, what's insomnia?
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.200]   What matters is this, that I've got a soul and it's lost and I've got to meet God in
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.640]   the everlasting judgment.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.840]   And eternal perdition lies beyond it for a man in my condition.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   That's the mark of a true work of God.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.840]   Humbling.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.560]   God, not men.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:32.240]   And then always, of course, it glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.280]   You read these early chapters and you'll find it everywhere.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.680]   This is the thing.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.840]   Not the teaching, not the experience, but this blessed Lord.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.440]   God, the God of our fathers raised up, Jesus whom he slew and hanged on a tree, him hath
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:50.800]   God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.760]   It's about him, not the petty problems of today, even sex included.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.560]   These are but little symptoms.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:03.560]   This is the central trouble, that man is an enemy and an alien from God and a rebel and
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.240]   under the wrath of God.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:11.200]   And there is only one who can reconcile him and that is this blessed Son of God, our Lord
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.640]   and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:19.320]   That's the one problem, not the particular sins, but man's total relationship to God
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:25.520]   and his lost estate and the only one who can deliver, the one whom God has sent, the one
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.880]   whom God has raised up and exalted to be a prince and a savior.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   Oh, it's a great and it's a glorious message.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.840]   He deals with the whole man.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.960]   He deals with his mind.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:44.240]   Look at this truth in the New Testament, how glorious, how big it is.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.680]   I've been trying to preach it for nearly 40 years.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.440]   I feel I'm but a beginner.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.520]   It expands before me in ever expanding vistas.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:58.640]   The glory, the profundity, the largeness of this truth is expanded by these apostles.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:07.840]   My mind is filled, my mind is expanded, the content of the message, how wonderful.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.200]   And likewise it deals with the heart in depth.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.440]   It doesn't drive me to a wild irrational ecstasy, neither does it leave me with a kind of maudling
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.400]   sentiment.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:25.640]   It moves me in a manner that it gives me thoughts that are often too deep for tears.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:32.720]   It moves one in the very depths of one's heart and emotions and it persuades the will by
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.960]   its mighty truth so that when the meeting has ended or the days have passed, I'm still
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:39.960]   the same.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.360]   The truth has taken hold of me and I'm convinced and convicted.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   I'm enlightened.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   I see it.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   I'm governed by it.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.640]   I am a slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.480]   I am a slave to his blessed truth.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.080]   That's the work of the Spirit of God.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.520]   And it goes on to produce in us the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:09.240]   If a man's life is not entirely changed, it's not a work of the Spirit of God.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.120]   Man can do many things.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.500]   Man can get adherence.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.360]   Man can get decisions.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   Man can get people to join the church.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   We've all done this.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.880]   We can all do it, you know, if we are worth our salt.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.800]   It's not a difficult thing to get people to take decisions or to become members of churches
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.160]   or to decide to be religious.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.080]   I can do all that.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.680]   But what I cannot do is to give a man a rebirth.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.760]   I can't give him a new nature.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.540]   I can't renovate him in the totality of his personality.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:44.520]   But the Spirit of God can and he does.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.400]   And so when a man is born again, he begins to give evidence of it.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.160]   He shows it in his life.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.400]   And it becomes something progressive.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.360]   It becomes deeper and deeper.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.920]   He gets a love of the Word of God.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.760]   Here's a very good test.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.960]   I've heard of people who seem to have been influenced and everybody thinks they've become
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.180]   Christians.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.240]   But I find they don't like teaching, profound teaching in the Bible.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.240]   They don't want that, they say.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.000]   "Oh no, that's too deep."
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Too deep?
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.120]   My dear friend, look at these people who were saved under the preaching of Peter on the
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.360]   day of Pentecost.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.960]   What I read about them is this.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:24.800]   They continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine of teaching, fellowship, breaking
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.080]   of bread and prayers.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.200]   These people, they were but slaves and serfs and soldiers.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.280]   But these are the people to whom Paul wrote his mighty epistles.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.080]   And they wanted it, they gloried in it.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:38.520]   They didn't just want a twenty minute sermon and say, "Oh, that's too deep, that's too
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.080]   profound, I can't understand.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.040]   I just want something to make me feel happy."
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   No, no.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.120]   When a man has been born again and has the Spirit of God in him, he wants to understand,
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:54.320]   he wants teaching, he loves the Word, he wants to pray, he enjoys the fellowship of God's
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   people.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:01.760]   They continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   and prayer.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.560]   And I don't care what's happened to you, if you aren't a thirst for this teaching, it's
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.400]   not the work of the Spirit of God.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:18.960]   Very well then, my friends, there are these great and vital and essential distinctions
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:30.280]   between the work of men and the work of the Spirit of God.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.440]   Which of them has taken place in you?
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:40.920]   Do you know that a work of the Spirit of God has taken place in you?
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.560]   It's the only thing that will be of value in the sight of God.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:52.120]   "Beware," says the whore of the New Testament, "of the counterfeit, the false.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:58.600]   Make certain that the work that is done in you is the work of the Spirit of God."
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   How do you test it?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.400]   I've told you.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.640]   Is it all you and your experience and what's happened to you?
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:17.680]   Or is it God and the glory of God and his great plan of redemption, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:22.240]   and that you miserable worm have been saved by him that even came on earth and went to
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.640]   the cross and was buried in a grave and rose again for you?
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   Which is it?
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.600]   Is it all self-centered, subjective, and are you always talking about yourself and what
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   you've done?
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:40.080]   Or are you lost before him with a sense of wonder, love, and praise?
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.080]   Are you humbled?
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:48.040]   Do you magnify God and his grace in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:51.400]   Have you become a problem and an enigma to yourself?
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.480]   Are you amazed at yourself and at this new life which is in you?
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.760]   If you can understand yourself, I tell you, you're not a Christian.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.040]   A Christian is a man who cannot understand himself.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.240]   He says with Paul, "I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.760]   It's the only explanation.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:15.360]   May God give us grace to make certain that the work that has happened in us is the work
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:22.680]   of the Spirit of God, the Spirit that was poured upon the church on the day of Pentecost,
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.960]   the Spirit that is still operative and operating amongst us.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.320]   Oh, my dear friend, don't give yourself rest nor peace until you're clear about this.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.520]   Have you been convicted of your sin?
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.920]   Have you seen your vileness?
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:40.240]   Have you realized that you're deserving of hell and nothing better?
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:47.560]   Do you know that God so loved you as to send his only begotten Son to bear the punishment
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.520]   of your sins in his own body on the tree?
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:58.480]   And have you become his slave who gave himself for you?
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:04.480]   And is it your cheapest desire now to make him known to others, not so much that they
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:10.280]   may be delivered from this or that, but that they may glory in him and praise him for the
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:17.320]   remainder of their days with you, and then all of us together in the glory everlasting.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.480]   Let every man examine himself.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:26.360]   Amen.
