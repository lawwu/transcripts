[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   You've studied the human mind, cognition, language, vision, evolution, psychology, from
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.240]   child to adult, from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization, so I feel
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.440]   like I can start with a simple multiple choice question. What is the meaning of life? Is it
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.560]   A) to attain knowledge, as Plato said? B) to attain power, as Nietzsche said? C) to escape
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.760]   death, as Ernest Becker said? D) to propagate our genes, as Darwin and others have said? E)
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.080]   there is no meaning, as the nihilists have said? F) knowing the meaning of life is beyond our
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.160]   cognitive capabilities, as Stephen Pinker said, based on my interpretation 20 years ago? And
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.960]   G) none of the above? I'd say A comes closest, but I would amend that to attaining not only
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.080]   knowledge, but fulfillment more generally. That is, life, health, stimulation, access to the
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.520]   living cultural and social world. Now this is our meaning of life, it's not the meaning of life,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.160]   if you were to ask our genes. Their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.600]   but that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.840]   So to you, knowledge is a small subset or a large subset?
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's a large subset, but it's not the entirety of human striving, because we also want to
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.680]   interact with people, we want to experience beauty, we want to experience the richness of
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.840]   the natural world. But understanding what makes the universe tick is way up there.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.000]   For some of us more than others, certainly for me that's one of the top five.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.520]   So is that a fundamental aspect? Are you just describing your own preference,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.280]   or is this a fundamental aspect of human nature, is to seek knowledge? In your latest book,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.880]   you talk about the power, the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on. Is that a
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.160]   fundamental nature of human beings, or is it something we should just strive for?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.840]   It's both. We're capable of striving for it, because it is one of the things that
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.600]   make us what we are â€” Homo sapiens, wise men. We are unusual among animals in the degree to which
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.760]   we acquire knowledge and use it to survive. We make tools, we strike agreements via language,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   we extract poisons, we predict the behavior of animals, we try to get at the workings of plants.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.640]   And when I say "we," I don't just mean "we" in the modern West, but "we" as a species everywhere,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.160]   which is how we've managed to occupy every niche on the planet, how we've managed to drive other
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.480]   animals to extinction. And the refinement of reason in pursuit of human well-being, of health,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.680]   happiness, social richness, cultural richness, is our main challenge in the present. That is,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   using our intellect, using our knowledge to figure out how the world works, how we work,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.200]   in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.320]   Right. And you do that almost undeniably and in a data-driven way in your recent book. But I'd like
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.360]   to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things, and not just artificial intelligence,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.880]   but natural intelligence too. So, 20 years ago, in the book you've written on how the mind works,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.480]   you conjecture, again, am I right to interpret things? You can correct me if I'm wrong, but
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.000]   you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a massive network of highly
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.480]   interconnected neurons. So, from this interconnectivity emerges thought. Compared to artificial
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.640]   neural networks, which we use for machine learning today, is there something fundamentally more
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.240]   complex, mysterious, even magical about the biological neural networks versus the ones
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.360]   we've been starting to use over the past 60 years and have become to success in the past 10?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.640]   There is something a little bit mysterious about the human neural networks, which is that
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.800]   each one of us who is a neural network knows that we ourselves are conscious.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.080]   Conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even registering our internal
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.680]   state, but in having subjective first-person present-tense experience. That is, when I see
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.400]   red, it's not just different from green, but there's a redness to it that I feel.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.720]   Whether an artificial system would experience that or not, I don't know, and I don't think I
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.480]   can know. That's why it's mysterious. If we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.800]   indistinguishable from a human, would we attribute consciousness to it, or ought we to attribute
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.160]   consciousness to it? That's something that it's very hard to know. But putting that aside,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.960]   putting aside that largely philosophical question, the question is, is there some difference between
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.840]   the human neural network and the ones that we're building in artificial intelligence will mean that
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.400]   we're, on the current trajectory, not going to reach the point where we've got a lifelike robot
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.600]   indistinguishable from a human, because the way their so-called neural networks are organized are
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.760]   different from the way ours are organized? I think there's overlap, but I think there are
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:47.440]   some big differences that the current neural networks, current so-called deep learning systems
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   are in reality not all that deep. That is, they are very good at extracting high-order
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   statistical regularities, but most of the systems don't have a semantic level, a level of actual
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.400]   understanding of who did what to whom, why, where, how things work, what causes what else.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.960]   - Do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does? So artificial neural networks are much
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.080]   smaller, the number of connections and so on, than the current human biological networks,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.160]   but do you think, sort of, to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.960]   about things, do you think that can emerge with just a larger network, with a more richly,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.360]   weirdly interconnected network? - Separate, again, consciousness,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.080]   because consciousness isn't even a matter of complexity. - It's a really weird one.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.560]   - Yeah, you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious, for example. They're
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   not terribly complex, but maybe they feel pain. So let's just put that part of it aside. But
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.760]   I think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.640]   but if it's suitably engineered, then why not? That is, we're neural networks, natural selection
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.280]   did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains, so I don't think there's anything
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.560]   mysterious in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.160]   do. I think it's possible in principle. Whether it'll ever happen depends not only on how clever
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.200]   we are in engineering these systems, but whether we even want to, whether that's even a sensible
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:29.520]   goal. That is, you can ask the question, is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human?
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   Well, we kind of want to do better than a human, ultimately, in terms of legged locomotion.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.360]   There's no reason that humans should be our benchmark. They're tools that might be better
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:49.280]   in some ways. It may be that we can't duplicate a natural system because at some point it's so
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.240]   much cheaper to use a natural system that we're not going to invest more brainpower and resources.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.080]   So for example, we don't really have an exact substitute for wood. We still build houses out
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.320]   of wood, we still build furniture out of wood. We like the look, we like the feel. Wood has
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.920]   certain properties that synthetics don't. It's not that there's anything magical or mysterious
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.960]   about wood. It's just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.160]   we just haven't bothered because we have wood. Like when I say cotton, I mean, I'm wearing
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.240]   cotton clothing now. It feels much better than polyester. It's not that cotton has something
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:33.120]   magic in it. And it's not that we couldn't ever synthesize something exactly like cotton.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.760]   But at some point it's just not worth it. We've got cotton. And likewise, in the case of human
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.520]   intelligence, the goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   is a goal that we probably no one is going to pursue to the bitter end, I suspect. Because
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.600]   if you want tools that do things better than humans, you're not going to care whether it
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.720]   does something like humans. So for example, diagnosing cancer or predicting the weather,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.280]   why set humans as your benchmark? - But in general, I suspect you also believe
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.480]   that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we don't want to imitate humans in their
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.520]   system, there's a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.400]   studying the human. - Yeah, I think that's right. In the same way that to build flying machines,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.440]   we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics, including birds, but not mimic the birds.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.880]   - Right, exactly. - But they're the same laws.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:39.600]   - You have a view on AI, artificial intelligence and safety, that from my perspective is
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:49.360]   refreshingly rational, or perhaps more importantly, has elements of positivity to it,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.440]   which I think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing. For many people,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:02.080]   including AI researchers, the eventual existential threat of AI is obvious, not only possible,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.680]   but obvious. And for many others, including AI researchers, the threat is not obvious.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   So Elon Musk is famously in the highly concerned about AI camp, saying things like AI is far more
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:24.080]   dangerous than nuclear weapons, and that AI will likely destroy human civilization. So in February,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.920]   he said that if Elon was really serious about AI, the threat of AI, he would stop building
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.040]   self-driving cars that he's doing very successfully as part of Tesla. Then he said,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.520]   wow, if even Pinker doesn't understand the difference between narrow AI, like a car,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.400]   and general AI, when the latter literally has a million times more compute power and an open-ended
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.120]   utility function, humanity is in deep trouble. So first, what did you mean by the statement about
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.200]   Elon Musk should stop building self-driving cars if he's deeply concerned?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.520]   - Not the last time that Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.440]   - Yeah, well, we live in a world where Twitter has power.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:16.640]   - Yes. Yeah, I think that there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.760]   in connection with artificial intelligence, and I think that they're both incoherent.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:28.800]   One of them is a vague fear of AI takeover, that just as we subjugated animals and less
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.360]   technologically advanced peoples, so if we build something that's more advanced than us,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.200]   it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.200]   I think this confuses intelligence with a will to power, that it so happens that in the intelligence
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.640]   system we are most familiar with, namely Homo sapiens, we are products of natural selection,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.760]   which is a competitive process, and so bundled together with our problem-solving capacity
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:06.080]   are a number of nasty traits like dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   and resources and influence. There's no reason to think that sheer problem-solving capability
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.680]   will set that as one of its goals. Its goals will be whatever we set its goals as, and as long as
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.680]   someone isn't building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence, then there's no reason to think that
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.120]   it would naturally evolve in that direction. Now, you might say, "Well, what if we gave it the goal
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:34.400]   of maximizing its own power source?" Well, that's a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.560]   You don't give it that goal. I mean, that's just self-evidently idiotic.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.800]   - So if you look at the history of the world, there's been a lot of opportunities where
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.680]   engineers could instill in a system destructive power, and they choose not to because that's the
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.800]   natural process of engineering. - Well, except for weapons. I mean,
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.200]   if you're building a weapon, its goal is to destroy people, and so I think there are good
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.320]   reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons. I think building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.760]   - You do. You think... So maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.080]   Do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been stopped early on,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.840]   or do you think it's just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented?
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.320]   Do you think it's possible to stop, I guess, is the question I'm asking.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.760]   - Yeah, it's hard to rewind the clock because, of course, it was invented in the context of
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:32.480]   World War II and the fear that the Nazis might develop one first. Then once it was initiated
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.880]   for that reason, it was hard to turn off, especially since winning the war against the
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.280]   Japanese and the Nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that there was
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.320]   just nothing that people wouldn't have done then to ensure victory. It's quite possible if World
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.240]   War II hadn't happened that nuclear weapons wouldn't have been invented. We can't know,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   but I don't think it was by any means a necessity any more than some of the other
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.440]   weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented, like planes that would disperse
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:13.040]   poison gas over cities like crop dusters, or systems to try to create earthquakes and tsunamis
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   in enemy countries, to weaponize the weather, weaponize solar flares, all kinds of crazy schemes
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.720]   that we thought the better of. I think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.920]   are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:36.080]   The point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things. The analogy is misleading.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.920]   >>Corey: There's two artificial intelligence you mentioned. The first one that gets highly
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   intelligent or power hungry.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.200]   >>Kaiser: Yeah, in a system that we design ourselves, where we give it the goals. Goals
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:54.240]   are external to the means to attain the goals. If we don't design an artificially intelligent
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.320]   system to maximize dominance, then it won't maximize dominance. It's just that we're so
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   familiar with Homo sapiens, where these two traits come bundled together, particularly in men,
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:14.480]   that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power, but that's just an error.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:21.440]   The other fear is that will be collateral damage, that will give artificial intelligence a goal,
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:27.440]   like make paperclips, and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it,
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.800]   it turns us into paperclips. We'll give it the goal of curing cancer, and it will turn us into
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.480]   guinea pigs for lethal experiments, or give it the goal of world peace, and its conception of
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.880]   world peace is no people, therefore no fighting, and so it will kill us all. Now, I think these
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.680]   are utterly fanciful. In fact, I think they're actually self-defeating. They, first of all,
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.480]   assume that we're going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:58.880]   cure cancer, but so stupid that we don't specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.800]   that it won't kill us in the process, and it assumes that the system will be so smart that
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   it can cure cancer, but so idiotic that it can't figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.880]   not killing everyone. So I think that the collateral damage scenario, the value alignment problem,
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.960]   is also based on a misconception. - So one of the challenges, of course,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.080]   we don't know how to build either system currently, or are we even close to knowing? Of course,
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.880]   those things can change overnight, but at this time, theorizing about it is very challenging
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:37.600]   in either direction, so that's probably at the core of the problem, is without that ability to
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.360]   reason about the real engineering things here at hand, is your imagination runs away with things.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.120]   - Exactly. - But let me sort of ask,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.840]   what do you think was the motivation and the thought process of Elon Musk? I build autonomous
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.000]   vehicles, I study autonomous vehicles, I study Tesla autopilot, I think it is one of the greatest
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.320]   currently large-scale applications of artificial intelligence in the world. It has potentially a
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:10.880]   very positive impact on society. So how does a person who's creating this very good, quote-unquote,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:19.280]   narrow AI system also seem to be so concerned about this other general AI? What do you think
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.040]   is the motivation there? What do you think is the thinking process?
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:29.600]   - Well, you probably have to ask him, and he is notoriously flamboyant, impulsive,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.040]   as we have just seen, to the detriment of his own goals of the health of a company.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.080]   So I don't know what's going on in his mind, you probably have to ask him.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:47.360]   But I don't think the distinction between special-purpose AI and so-called general AI is
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.000]   relevant, that in the same way that special-purpose AI is not going to do anything conceivable in
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.560]   order to attain a goal. All engineering systems are designed to trade off across multiple goals.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.840]   When we built cars in the first place, we didn't forget to install brakes, because the goal of a
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.080]   car is to go fast. It occurred to people, yes, you want it to go fast, but not always, so you
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:18.960]   build in brakes too. Likewise, if a car is going to be autonomous, and program it to take the
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.360]   shortest route to the airport, it's not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.440]   and fences, because that's the shortest route. That's not what we mean by the shortest route
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:34.000]   when we program it, and that's just what an intelligence system is by definition. It takes
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.200]   into account multiple constraints. The same is true, in fact, even more true of so-called
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.760]   general intelligence. That is, if it's genuinely intelligent, it's not going to pursue some goal
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:52.720]   single-mindedly, omitting every other consideration and collateral effect. That's not
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.560]   artificial and general intelligence, that's artificial stupidity. I agree with you, by the way,
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.200]   on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare. I think it's spectacular,
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.320]   and I'm surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the United States alone, something
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.240]   like 40,000 people die every year on the highways, vastly more than are killed by terrorists. We
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.560]   spend a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism, about half a dozen a year,
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.000]   whereas year in, year out, 40,000 people are massacred on the highways, which could be brought
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.960]   down to very close to zero. I'm with you on the humanitarian benefit. Let me just mention that
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.880]   it's, as a person who's building these cars, it is a little bit offensive to me to say that
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.720]   engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems. I often stay up at night
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.480]   thinking about those 40,000 people that are dying, and everything I try to engineer is to save those
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.600]   people's lives. So every new invention that I'm super excited about, every new, and in all the
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.400]   deep learning literature and CVPR conferences and NIPS, everything I'm super excited about
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   is all grounded in making it safe and help people. So I just don't see how that trajectory can all
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.600]   of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.920]   - You and I certainly agree on that, and I think that's only the beginning of the
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:24.320]   potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence. There's been enormous attention to
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.720]   what are we gonna do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.480]   but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are gonna be made obsolete are
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:39.760]   horrible jobs. The fact that people aren't gonna be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.720]   and mining coal, these are soul-deadening jobs, and we have a whole literature
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:51.280]   sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial, mind-deadening, dangerous jobs.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:57.520]   If we can eliminate them, this is a fantastic boon to humanity. Now granted, you solve one
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   problem and there's another one, namely how do we get these people a decent income, but if we're
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:10.640]   smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.320]   I think we're smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.520]   vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to make beds.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:28.400]   - Okay, Sam Harris says that it's obvious that eventually AI will be an existential risk.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:36.240]   He's one of the people who says it's obvious. We don't know when the claim goes, but eventually
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.760]   it's obvious, and because we don't know when, we should worry about it now. It's a very interesting
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.120]   argument in my eyes. So how do we think about timescale? How do we think about existential
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.040]   threats when we don't really, we know so little about the threat, unlike nuclear weapons perhaps,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:02.320]   about this particular threat, that it could happen tomorrow, right? But very likely it won't.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:02.960]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.320]   - Very likely it'd be 100 years away. So how do we ignore it? How do we talk about it?
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.440]   Do we worry about it? How do we think about those?
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.040]   - What is it?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.560]   - A threat that we can imagine. It's within the limits of our imagination,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.360]   but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.320]   - But what is the it that we're afraid of?
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.200]   - Oh, AI, sorry, AI being the existential threat. AI can always--
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.400]   - But how? Like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips?
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.720]   - I think the most compelling from the Sam Harris perspective would be the paperclip situation.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:45.600]   - Yeah, I just think it's totally fanciful. I mean, don't build a system. First of all,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:52.000]   the code of engineering is you don't implement a system with massive control before testing it.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.080]   Now, perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change, then I would worry,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.200]   but I don't see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things, like put an
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.440]   electrical power plant in control of a system that they haven't tested
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.720]   first. Or all of these scenarios not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.160]   including things like cure cancer, which is probably an incoherent goal because there's
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.880]   so many different kinds of cancer, or bring about world peace. I mean, how do you even
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.040]   specify that as a goal? But the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.440]   in the universe, which not only is itself unlikely, but we would not start to connect
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:45.680]   these systems to infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:53.840]   Now, maybe some engineers will be irresponsible, and we need legal and regulatory and legal
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.440]   responsibility implemented so that engineers don't do things that are stupid by their own standards.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:08.560]   But I've never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.640]   amounts of brain power to forestall it. >>Corey: So you believe in the power en masse
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.640]   of the engineering of reason, as you argue in your latest book of Reason and Science, to be
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.400]   the very thing that guides the development of new technologies so it's safe and also keeps us safe.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:32.480]   >>Kaiser: Yeah, if the same â€” granted, the same culture of safety that currently is part of the
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:39.360]   engineering mindset for airplanes, for example. So yeah, I don't think that that should be thrown
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.880]   out the window and that untested, all-powerful systems should be suddenly implemented. But
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.120]   there's no reason to think they are. And in fact, if you look at the progress of artificial
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.840]   intelligence, it's been impressive, especially in the last 10 years or so. But the idea that
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.400]   suddenly there'll be a step function, that all of a sudden, before we know it, it will be
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.520]   all-powerful, that there'll be some kind of recursive self-improvement, some kind of
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:12.560]   fume, is also fanciful. Certainly by the technology that now impresses us, such as
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:18.320]   deep learning, where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:25.200]   they're not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.440]   And so the kind of techniques that have allowed AI to increase in the last five years are not
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:38.320]   the kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential, sudden self-improvement.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.200]   >>Zubin: So â€”
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.880]   >>Kaiser: I think it's kind of a magical thinking. It's not based on
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.120]   our understanding of how AI actually works.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.280]   >>Zubin: Now, give me a chance here. So you said fanciful, magical thinking.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.360]   In his TED Talk, Sam Harris says that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is somehow
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.480]   fun, intellectually. Now, I have to say, as a scientist and engineer, I don't find it fun.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.400]   But when I'm having beer with my non-AI friends, there is indeed something
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.280]   fun and appealing about it. Like talking about an episode of Black Mirror, considering
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.440]   if a large meteor is headed towards Earth â€” we were just told a large meteor is headed towards
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.040]   Earth, something like this. And can you relate to this sense of fun? And do you
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.480]   understand the psychology of it?
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.400]   >>Kaiser: Yes, right. Good question. I personally don't find it fun. I find it
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:36.720]   kind of actually a waste of time, because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:44.160]   about, like pandemics, like cybersecurity vulnerabilities, like the possibility of
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:51.200]   nuclear war, and certainly climate change. This is enough to fill many conversations.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:57.040]   And I think Sam did put his finger on something, namely that there is a community,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:05.360]   sometimes called the rationality community, that delights in using its brainpower to come up with
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:12.640]   scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals, to less cerebral people. So there is a kind of
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.440]   intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.160]   I actually think, though, that it's â€” not only is it a kind of fun that doesn't give me
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.840]   particular pleasure, but I think there can be a pernicious side to it, namely that you
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   overcome people with such dread, such fatalism, that there's so many ways to die to annihilate
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.720]   our civilization, that we may as well enjoy life while we can. There's nothing we can do about it.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.880]   If climate change doesn't do us in, then runaway robots will. So let's enjoy ourselves now.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:54.320]   We've got to prioritize. We have to look at threats that are close to certainty,
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.960]   such as climate change, and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.920]   but with infinitesimal probabilities. And we have to take into account people's worry budget. You
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:13.200]   can't worry about everything. And if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism, it can lead to
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.520]   a kind of numbness. Well, these problems are overwhelming, and the engineers are just going
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:25.760]   to kill us all. So let's either destroy the entire infrastructure of science, technology,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:31.600]   or let's just enjoy life while we can. - So there's a certain line of worry,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.560]   which I'm worried about a lot of things in engineering. There's a certain line of worry
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:40.960]   when you cross, you're allowed to cross, that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:47.200]   productive fear. And that's kind of what you're highlighting. - Exactly right. And we've seen
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:55.840]   some, we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that, because a basic
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.720]   tenet of cognitive psychology is that perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:11.200]   imaginability, not by data. And so we misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism,
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.880]   which kills on average about six Americans a year, with one exception of 9/11. We invade countries,
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:24.480]   we invent entire new departments of government with massive, massive expenditure of resources
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:31.360]   and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk. Whereas guaranteed risks, you mentioned,
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.720]   as one of them is, you mentioned traffic fatalities, and even risks that are
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:46.240]   not here, but are plausible enough to worry about, like pandemics, like nuclear war,
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.760]   receive far too little attention. In presidential debates, there's no discussion of
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:58.880]   how to minimize the risk of nuclear war. Lots of discussion of terrorism, for example. And so we,
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:07.120]   I think it's essential to calibrate our budget of fear, worry, concern planning to the actual
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   probability of harm. - Yep. So let me ask this, then this question. So speaking of imaginability,
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.120]   you said that it's important to think about reason. And one of my favorite people who likes
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.200]   to dip into the outskirts of reason through fascinating exploration of his imagination
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:34.880]   is Joe Rogan. - Oh, yes. - So who has, through reason, used to believe a lot of conspiracies,
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.760]   and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way. So it's fascinating,
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:47.520]   actually, to watch him, through rationality, kind of throw away the ideas of Bigfoot and 9/11. I'm
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.360]   not sure exactly. - Kim Trails. I don't know what he believes in. Yes, okay. - But he no longer-
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.400]   - Believed in, no, that's right. - Believed in, that's right. - No, he's become a real force for
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.240]   good. - Yep. So you were on the Joe Rogan podcast in February and had a fascinating conversation,
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.920]   but as far as I remember, didn't talk much about artificial intelligence. I will be on his podcast
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.520]   in a couple weeks. Joe is very much concerned about existential threat of AI. I'm not sure if
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.920]   you're, which is why I was hoping that you would get into that topic. And in this way, he represents
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.800]   quite a lot of people who look at the topic of AI from 10,000 foot level. So as an exercise of
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.400]   communication, you said it's important to be rational and reason about these things. Let me
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.160]   ask, if you were to coach me as an AI researcher about how to speak to Joe and the general public
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.680]   about AI, what would you advise? - Well, the short answer would be to read the sections that I wrote
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.720]   in Enlightenment, you know, about AI. But a longer reason would be, I think, to emphasize, and I
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.840]   think you're very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:32:00.560]   that it really is safety oriented. Another discussion in Enlightenment now, I plot rates
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:07.280]   of accidental death from various causes, plane crashes, car crashes, occupational accidents,
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:14.320]   even death by lightning strikes. And they all plummet because the culture of engineering is,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:21.760]   how do you squeeze out the lethal risks? Death by fire, death by drowning, death by asphyxiation,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.680]   all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering, that I gotta say,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:32.480]   I did not appreciate until I saw those graphs. And it is because, exactly, people like you who
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:40.400]   stamp it and I think, oh my God, is what I'm inventing likely to hurt people? And to deploy
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.920]   ingenuity to prevent that from happening. Now, I'm not an engineer, although I spent 22 years at MIT,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.120]   so I know something about the culture of engineering. My understanding is that this
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:55.600]   is the way you think if you're an engineer. And it's essential that that culture not be suddenly
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.400]   switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence. So, I mean, that could be a
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.840]   problem, but is there any reason to think it would be switched off? - I don't think so. And
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:11.040]   one, there's not enough engineers speaking up for this way, for the excitement, for the positive
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.520]   view of human nature, what you're trying to create is the positivity. Like everything we try to
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.880]   invent is trying to do good for the world. But let me ask you about the psychology of negativity.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:26.640]   It seems just objectively, not considering the topic, it seems that being negative about the
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.080]   future makes you sound smarter than being positive about the future, irregardless of topic. Am I
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.760]   correct in this observation? And if so, why do you think that is? - Yeah, I think there is that
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.440]   phenomenon that, as Tom Lehrer, the satirist said, "Always predict the worst and you'll be
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:50.880]   hailed as a prophet." It may be part of our overall negativity bias. We are, as a species,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:57.280]   more attuned to the negative than the positive. We dread losses more than we enjoy gains. And
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:06.080]   that might open up a space for prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:15.120]   overlooked. So I think there is that asymmetry. - So you've written some of my favorite books
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:21.680]   all over the place. So starting from Enlightenment Now to The Better Angels of Our Nature,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:28.560]   Blank Slate, How the Mind Works, the one about language, Language Instinct. Bill Gates,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:35.680]   big fan too, said of your most recent book that it's my new favorite book of all time.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:43.840]   So for you as an author, what was the book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.520]   way you saw the world? - Certainly this book, Enlightenment Now, is influenced by David Deutsch's
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:56.640]   The Beginning of Infinity. A rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of knowledge to
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.040]   improve the human condition. And with bits of wisdom such as that problems are inevitable,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.440]   but problems are solvable given the right knowledge, and that solutions create new
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.920]   problems that have to be solved in their turn. That's, I think, a kind of wisdom about the human
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.240]   condition that influenced the writing of this book. There's some books that are excellent but
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.760]   obscure, some of which I have on a page of my website. I read a book called The History of
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.440]   Force, self-published by a political scientist named James Paine on the historical decline of
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:34.000]   violence, and that was one of the inspirations for The Better Angels of Our Nature. - What about
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.200]   early on? If you look back when you were maybe a teenager, is there some-- - I loved a book called
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.240]   One, Two, Three, Infinity. When I was a young adult, I read that book by George Gamow, the
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:52.320]   physicist. He had very accessible and humorous explanations of relativity, of number theory, of
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:36:01.360]   dimensionality, high multiple dimensional spaces, in a way that I think is still delightful 70 years
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   after it was published. I like the Time-Life Science series. These are books that arrive
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:14.480]   every month that my mother subscribed to, each one on a different topic. One would be on electricity,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.320]   one would be on forests, one would be on evolution, and then one was on the mind.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:25.280]   I was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind, and that book I would cite as an
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.360]   influence as well. Then later on-- - That's when you fell in love with the idea of studying the
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.480]   mind? - That's one of the-- - Was that the thing that grabbed you? - It was one of the things,
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:40.160]   I would say. I read as a college student the book Reflections on Language by Noam Chomsky,
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:46.640]   who spent most of his career here at MIT. Richard Dawkins, two books, The Blind Watchmaker and The
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:54.000]   Selfish Gene, were enormously influential, mainly for the content, but also for the writing style,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:02.480]   the ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose. Stephen Jay Gould's first collection,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:10.000]   Ever Since Darwin, also an excellent example of lively writing. George Miller, a psychologist
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.600]   that most psychologists are familiar with, came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.640]   seven plus or minus two chunks. That's probably his biggest claim to fame. But he wrote a couple
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.840]   of books on language and communication that I read as an undergraduate. Again, beautifully written
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.680]   and intellectually deep. - Wonderful. Stephen, thank you so much for taking the time today.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.120]   - My pleasure. Thanks a lot, Lex.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:33.860]   - Thanks.
