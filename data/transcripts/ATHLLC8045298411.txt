[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.060]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.800]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.640]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to do something different today.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.800]   In fact, if you're watching this on YouTube, you'll already know why because
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.680]   I'm recording this from an overwater bungalow at the St.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.960]   Regis in Bora Bora.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.880]   These views are amazing.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.760]   Now, so many of the listener questions I get are about how to maximize your
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   points and miles for amazing redemptions.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.720]   And I wanted to take this episode to share how we ended up taking a trip that
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.760]   would have otherwise cost me and Amy over $20,000 for less than $1,500 in points.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.560]   And I'm actually going to walk through all the steps to search for flights,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   transfer points, and book hotels.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.280]   So you can use those tips to get the best deal possible on your next trip.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.060]   Two quick things before we get started.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900]   One, if you're new to the show and you want to get a good foundation for
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.820]   travel hacking, points, and miles, I'd recommend going back and listening to
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.540]   episode one with Lee Rowan on travel hacking, episode three with Brad Barrett
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.220]   on credit card points and miles, or episode 27 with the points guy himself,
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.140]   Brian Kelly, and two, if you're already thinking that a trip like this is out
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.620]   of reach for you, hold on, I want to read you this amazing email I just got a few
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.280]   weeks ago, Chris, my name's Zach.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.200]   I'm a medical student currently finishing up my second year and have been a fan of
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.120]   your podcast since the first episode came out, I really like what you're doing.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.320]   And I've been putting a lot of the hacks you and your guests talk about to work.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.400]   As you can imagine, money is incredibly tight for a medical student.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.320]   However, my girlfriend and I put some of your credit card signup bonus and
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.380]   flight hotel point hacks to work.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.280]   And we were able to use almost exclusively points and miles to cover round trip
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.100]   flights and four to five star hotels for a 10 day trip to Europe to celebrate our
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.940]   four year anniversary in a few months.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.400]   We ended up turning 350,000 points and miles from credit card, signup bonuses
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.060]   and other necessary purchases into flights and hotels that we calculated
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.980]   equals about $7,200 of value.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.120]   I think this is proof that what you're talking about works for literally anyone,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.160]   even a medical student who has basically no money, thanks again for what you're
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.640]   doing and I look forward to listening to more episodes of all the hacks in the
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.120]   future.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840]   So Zach, thank you so much for writing that in.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.960]   I am so excited for your trip and I just hope that helps anyone listening know
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.180]   that these hacks are really accessible and I hope they help you take an amazing
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.560]   trip.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.540]   And while I'm going to walk you through everything I did for this trip on the
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.880]   podcast on YouTube, I'm actually going to share some footage from the trip and
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   I'll also share my screen as I walk through some of the booking steps.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.560]   So if you want to watch that, head on over to all the hacks.com/49 because this
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.840]   is episode 49 and check it out.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.480]   And if you have any followup questions or want some clarification, don't hesitate
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.000]   to shoot me an email, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So first off, how did this trip even come to be?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, if you've been listening, you might know that my wife and I are expecting
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400]   our second child in June this year.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.040]   So we were trying to think what kind of a vacation we could take before the
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.960]   craziness of having two children come.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.240]   And my parents kindly volunteered to watch our daughter for one week and told
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.920]   us this week would work best.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.960]   So we started thinking about what we could possibly do with one week off.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.760]   And we had all these points that we wanted to burn them on something amazing.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.560]   And so we started looking and we kind of identified, we didn't want to go too
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.320]   crazy far just for the fact that we only had a week.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.480]   So it was where can we go on flights for less than 10 hours and the options,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.680]   unfortunately, from the West coast, a lot of the Caribbean is really hard to get to.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.360]   So we looked at places like Turks and Caicos, so we even looked at Costa Rica
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   and it just seemed like it was going to be a really tough trip to take multiple
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.120]   layovers to get to where you wanted to.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.800]   And it just wasn't that convenient.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.920]   And we'd come to Bora Bora back in 2018 and we stayed at the Conrad and I'll
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.000]   talk about the differences between that and the St.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.520]   Regis in a bit, but it was so amazing that we thought, well, we might as well
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.320]   just look to see if that's possible.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.760]   So we kind of had an idea from the beginning of let's just take the
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.560]   most amazing, relaxing vacation.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.960]   We can, we know Bora Bora is one nonstop flight.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's about eight hours from San Francisco.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.440]   And then you take a small plane from Papiete to here, which you could probably
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.120]   hear flying above me right now.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.480]   And that is exactly what we thought we would do.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.360]   So, so that was the idea was from the beginning, can we make Bora Bora
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.720]   possible with points with miles?
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.520]   Actually, before we get into everything, I just want to paint a
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.600]   picture of how amazing this place is.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.280]   My wife and I have been on a lot of trips and we always say next time
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.360]   we're going to go somewhere new, but Bora Bora and Japan are two places
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   that we always say, you know what?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.200]   Let's just go back there again, because it's so incredible.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.080]   The water is the clearest thing you could possibly imagine.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.920]   Resorts have hammocks that just sit out in the ocean.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   So you can just lie, relax and enjoy just the most beautiful views.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.280]   There's something super special about having a bungalow that sits over the
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.600]   water where you can jump off your balcony straight into the water.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.960]   You get bikes and you can ride them all around.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.160]   It's like the most relaxing manicured place to just, everyone is so friendly.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.600]   I just, it's hard to be more excited about a place you can go on vacation than here.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.680]   And one of the things I really love is that I've been to a few resorts,
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.160]   sometimes in Mexico or in the Caribbean, where it just feels like you took a
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.840]   bunch of American culture and you just plopped it down in the middle of a nice
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.560]   beach, and this is totally different than that.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.280]   French Polynesia has a very distinct culture and most of the resorts here
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.160]   try to infuse that culture into the resort.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.440]   So you really get a feel for it, whether it's activities, excursions,
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.600]   doing a Polynesian night, different types of food that you can try.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.680]   The staff at most of these resorts is like the most friendly people ever,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.840]   and you can spend time talking to them about their culture and understand it.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.280]   And so I think that's another part of travel that's really important
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.560]   to us that you get to do here.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.720]   I think that's it.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.800]   I just wanted to paint a picture of what an amazing magical
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.600]   experience a trip like this can be.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.520]   I know a lot of people say it's once in a lifetime, but the reason I love
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.000]   points, the reason I love miles, the reason I love all the hacks is because
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.520]   there's a way to make it possible way more frequently than once in a lifetime
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   without having to spend the money it would otherwise cost.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.200]   If you're watching this on video, I have overlaid a bunch of pictures
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.160]   and videos so you could really get a sense of how cool this place is.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.600]   If you want to go check out the video, you can see all that.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.000]   Or if you head on over to my Instagram, just @chrishutchins, I'll try to post
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.680]   some photos and videos so you can get a sense of how really magical this place is.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.320]   So now that we know where we're going, I want to start looking at how
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.680]   we can get there, and then I'll look at where to stay.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.880]   So we want to go to Papiete, which is the main international
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.280]   airport in French Polynesia.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.480]   So I like to start all of these searches by going to flightconnections.com.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.880]   And I do that because they show you all the routes that you
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.960]   can get to a certain airport from.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.080]   So for Papiete, you can see that in the U.S.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.840]   the only routes are from San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.480]   Now for us trying to take a week trip, which is going to be a short trip, flying
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.920]   from San Francisco to Honolulu, and then down to Papiete, it's just not in the cards.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.160]   So we're really looking at SFO and LAX flights.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.480]   So now that I know what the routes are, I first like to
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.200]   go see how much are the flights.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   And the way I typically do that is not looking for my home
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.760]   destination, but just looking at the specific nonstop flights,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.240]   because you get a sense of what the international prices are going to be.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   So I'm going to go to Google flights and I'm going to search
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.560]   for San Francisco or LAX.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.000]   And so you can search multiple froms and multiple tos at Google flights.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.680]   And so you type SFO and then the easiest way to do it is once you hit comma,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.200]   Google flights saves that.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   And so you can type SFO comma LAX comma, and then you search PPT.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.080]   Now, unfortunately, Google flights will not let you search for
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.920]   nonstop flights from the get go.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.640]   So you have to click into a search and then filter to nonstop.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.160]   So now that I've filtered to nonstop, I'm going to look at round trip
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.880]   flights from SFO or LAX to PPT.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.800]   I'm going to go in and search by clicking on the date field.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.880]   You can actually in the bottom left say, show me five day trips.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.600]   And you can actually look at how much these tickets are going to cost.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.000]   And what I'm seeing is that on most days for the rest of March
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   and a lot of days in April, the round trip tickets are 550 to 600,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.040]   700 dollars, which is pretty reasonable for a long distance international flight.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.160]   So out the gate, I'm thinking, wow, I don't even know if I want to use
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.920]   miles, but, you know, it's a short trip.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.960]   A lot of the flights are overnight.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.680]   I've got a lot of miles.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.200]   What about business?
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.680]   Every now and then I look at business internationally
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.440]   and it's really not that much more.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.280]   In this case, I'm going to look and I already know what I'm going to see.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.680]   It's going to be almost five grand or more, which for me
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   just makes it completely off the table.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.640]   So at this point, I've kind of said, all right, I'm going to fly economy
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.600]   or I'm going to see if there's miles available for business.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.520]   Obviously, if the miles are available for business and it's a good deal,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.240]   that's what I would prefer to do.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.440]   So now that I know the flight routes there are, right,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.680]   you can click through Google flights and you can see, OK, well, United has a flight
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.760]   Air Tahiti, Nuea has a flight, Air France has a flight.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.800]   Keep in mind that for a lot of international destinations,
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.600]   the day you fly on might actually change what airlines have flights.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.840]   They might not all have flights the same day.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.720]   So if you're clicking through days, you'll actually see that on some days
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.760]   an airline called French B actually flies from San Francisco.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.880]   It's the airline we flew down to French Polynesia the last time we came.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.400]   And I thought it was a great experience.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.120]   So definitely click around to make sure you know what airlines are looking for.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.920]   Now, I can tell you in advance that French B doesn't have a mileage program
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.560]   that lets you book award tickets.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.600]   So I'm going to start looking first on United.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.200]   Now, if you search SFO to PPT and you search a date, you click award travel.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.320]   You're going to get a list of flights for that day,
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.640]   but you're also going to get an award calendar at the top.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.760]   And if you click under that, you'll see view 30 day calendar
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.120]   and you can actually see all the different award prices.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.680]   So you'll see that on every Sunday and really Tuesday,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.040]   almost all the flights United flies for the rest of March and into April.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   Almost every week you can find a flight for thirty five thousand or thirty
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.560]   seven thousand miles.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.600]   But knowing that the flights are only six hundred round trip
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.440]   and if you dig into the one way prices, you'll learn they're about 380 going down,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.320]   maybe 280 or 300 coming back.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.360]   I'm not sure I'd rather use thirty five thousand miles for the ticket.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.240]   But if I look in business,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.200]   you'll see that seventy thousand points going down.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   United has availability on the next four Sundays
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.840]   and you can go search round trip, see when it's available on the way coming back.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.120]   So now all of a sudden I've said, OK, that's low inventory.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.960]   I know that that's one of the lowest prices you'll see.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.920]   United even highlights it in green if it's the lowest price in the month.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.600]   So now we're like, OK, so United has some tickets coming down.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   You can also check the other airline.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.320]   So I said French B doesn't have anything, but there's also Air France
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.400]   and there's air to heating away.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.280]   So you can go through the Air France website and do it for air to heating away.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.920]   While I'm sure you don't have air to heating away in miles,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.520]   you probably maybe have or have access from a transfer partner to American
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.560]   who are partners so you could book for American.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.000]   So you can actually search those flights on their websites.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.320]   I have a subscription to a website called Expert Flyer,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.480]   and that site lets you search award inventory for a lot of flights.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.080]   So I can actually go there and just say I'm looking for L.A.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.000]   X to PPT and do a search.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.120]   One of the great features they have is that you can search three days
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.480]   before and three days after.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.080]   So you can search seven days at a time and I can go in and search air
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.280]   to heating away and I can say I'm looking for a business award
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.160]   and it'll come back and show you here's what we found.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.920]   Now, I can tell you that it's hard to find a word availability
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.240]   far out in advance.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.480]   A lot of airlines don't release all the inventory.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.320]   But when you're trying to book something somewhat last minute,
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.160]   sometimes you get really, really lucky.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.440]   So in the case of United, you saw that, you know, we got award
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.760]   availability on business class seats four days in a row on air to heating away.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.840]   It looks like I'm currently looking and there's nothing to get down.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.320]   But coming back, if you want to leave on the 30th of March,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.240]   there's five seats back to L.A..
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.360]   So maybe that's an option.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.680]   And the availability changes all the time.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.920]   Expert Flyer actually lets you set alerts to say, hey, if something pops up,
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.000]   let me know.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.320]   I'll save you the looking air.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.200]   France had no availability, so I'll just skip over it.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.880]   But if you really wanted to book that air to heating away flight,
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.360]   you can actually go on American Airlines's website
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.000]   and you can just search PPT to LAX.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.320]   You can say book with miles and it'll show up.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.480]   I happen to know that it's going to be 80,000 miles to book that flight.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.880]   And so from my perspective, I'd rather just use the 72,000 United miles.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.600]   However, one of the things to know is that when there's availability
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.040]   on an airline, that means that you can book it from any of their partners.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.280]   So that's where a search like Point.me really comes in to benefit you.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.680]   So I'm going to go do this search on Point.me and I already did it,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.840]   but I have it pulled up in front of me.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.120]   And what happens is they say, yep, we found the availability on United.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.240]   This was for March 20th.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.000]   And when you look at the options to book it, they say, yeah,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.920]   you can book it with United with 72,800 miles.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.840]   But you can also book it with Air Canada for 55,000 miles.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   And Air Canada happens to be a transfer partner of Amex Capital One and Chase.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.080]   And let me tell you, like, I love Air Canada as a mileage program.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.960]   The aeroplane program has some really great spots of redemption just like this.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.880]   So now I'm thinking, OK, whether you have Amex points,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.760]   Cap One points, Chase points, or you happen to be someone with Air Canada points.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.360]   That's 55,000 miles down.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.720]   You can find the return 55,000 back.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.480]   That's 110,000 miles for your trip.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.680]   So what is 110,000 miles worth?
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.880]   Well, if you know that the business class flight would have been about $5,700,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.600]   then that's five cents a mile.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.840]   To put that in perspective, if you were using a card
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.280]   that earns you three points per dollar on travel expenses
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.440]   and you can get five cents per mile, that's like getting 15% cash back.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   So I think that's an amazing deal.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.920]   And in fact, that is exactly what we did to come down here.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.760]   We got Air Canada miles and we used them to book
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.840]   United business class seats for 110,000 miles each.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.120]   And the taxes, as you could see, were $36.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.240]   And it's really easy.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.520]   You can create an account on Air Canada's website.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.480]   You can go search for the flights.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   And once you find the availability, you can go to Chase or Cap One
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.720]   and do the transfer.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.680]   Usually you just log out, log back in and boom.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.480]   There they show up right there.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.880]   Make it really easy to book.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.840]   So that's how we got here.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.600]   We booked it through on United in business with Air Canada miles.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.840]   It ended up being $36 each way per person, whereas the two business
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.640]   class tickets would have been over $11,000.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.800]   So that's flights.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.000]   That is how I typically do all of this searching.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.880]   Point dot me is a great place.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.800]   You could even start there if you want.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.240]   It's pretty great at searching across lots of different travel sites.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.080]   The challenge is they don't have any flexible date search.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.600]   So when you go to United's website, you can look at a 30 day calendar
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.880]   and get a sense of whether there's something great one day with Point dot me.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.360]   You've got to go search a day and then the next day and then the next day.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.840]   So when there's only a few options of flights and you're flexible on dates,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.320]   I like to start searching on the airline's websites.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.080]   But if you're pretty strict on dates
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.600]   and you're going somewhere with lots of options like the US to Europe,
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.160]   it could definitely be easier to search on Point dot me.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.200]   But keep in mind, sometimes there's strange things that happen
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:36.040]   where it might be availability from San Francisco to Paris,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.520]   but not from Paris to, let's say, Nice, France.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.560]   And it might be a really cheap flight.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   So definitely make sure that when you're looking for award flights,
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.560]   you're not just looking at the whole trip.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.360]   You might be looking at the major leg that you really want.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.400]   And you could maybe buy a cheap fifty hundred dollar ticket
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.840]   on either end to make make it all the way to your destination.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.440]   Hey, everybody, I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.960]   dot me, my favorite award search tool to give you a special offer of only one
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.480]   dollar for your first month of their standard plan.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.440]   If you go to all the hacks dot com slash point me and use the promo code hacks
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.160]   again, all the hacks dot com slash P.O.I.N.T.M.E.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.160]   Or find the link in the show notes.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.280]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.520]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.200]   and the cracks start to emerge, things that you used to do in a day
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.760]   are taking a week and you have too many manual processes
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.000]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.600]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.200]   Thirty seven thousand twenty five one thirty seven thousand.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.720]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.120]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.040]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.960]   streamlining accounting, financial management, inventory, HR and more.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.360]   Twenty five NetSuite turns twenty five this year.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.960]   That's twenty five years of helping businesses do more with less
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.840]   close their books in days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.480]   And one because your business is one of a kind.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.800]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.920]   in one efficient system with one source of truth.

[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.360]   So now let's talk about hotels.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.120]   Once I figured out we could get flights and I knew that there were a lot
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   of different days and actually, you know, I'm speaking in Bora Bora right now.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.800]   So when I was looking at this, United had a business class
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.200]   three different days in a single week.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.360]   So I kind of knew I had a little bit of flexibility.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.400]   We probably had 12 days and we wanted to go for six.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.520]   So I kind of had a little bit of wiggle room.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.080]   So I said, great.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.640]   Now I know that the flights are there.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.880]   Let's pause and let's look at hotels.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.520]   And I think one of the first things to do when you're looking at hotels
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.960]   is just to get a sense of what are the rates, because sometimes miles
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.440]   and points for hotels don't make a lot of sense.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.920]   Sometimes I like Google for hotels.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.800]   Their hotel search is pretty good.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.520]   Lots of websites to look for hotels, whichever one has the right filters.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.840]   You like go for it.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.120]   You could use TripAdvisor.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.400]   You could use Kayak.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.000]   It really just matters what you like.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.040]   Right now, we're not trying to book a hotel.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.600]   We're just trying to search.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   So if I go on and search Bora Bora on Google Hotels,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.320]   you'll see that there are a lot of hotels that come up.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.240]   You know, fortunately for Bora Bora, there aren't an unlimited number.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.280]   There's like eight or nine hotels that are kind of high end.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.400]   Go take a luxury vacation.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.920]   And so I can look at them and say, OK, well, look, the Conrad $722 a night.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.040]   St. Regis, $1200 a night.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.320]   And I'm here looking March 21st to 26.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.680]   Once you find a hotel, one of the nice things that Google let you do
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.880]   and it doesn't work until you pick the hotel.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.640]   But in this example, if you go and click view prices on a Google hotels listing,
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.920]   now you can actually go to the dates and they'll say best prices for one night's
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.000]   day and they'll show you all the prices.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.680]   And so you can actually look out and say, wow, you know, there are some days
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.200]   that are ridiculously expensive.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.480]   Like I'm looking right now, April 4th.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.600]   The average rate for a night at the St.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.680]   Regis in Bora Bora is thirty five hundred to three thousand dollars a night,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.400]   which means a five night stay is going to cost you almost 20 grand.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.840]   When I actually booked this trip, the rate per night was about twenty one hundred dollars.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.000]   For me, I was like, wow, there's no world where I could get comfortable
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.800]   spending ten thousand dollars on a vacation.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   So it's time to look at points.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   And fortunately, in Bora Bora, there's two intercontinental hotels.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.720]   There's a Conrad, there's a St.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   Regis, all you different Hilton, Marriott or IHG points,
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.440]   all which have transfer partners.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.800]   So when I'm trying to find the award hotels where I might get the best deal,
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.200]   I love this site award mapper dot com.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.320]   If you're watching the video, you'll see that I actually have a pulled up in Paris
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.000]   because there's a bit of a bug on the site right now when it comes to Bora Bora.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.840]   But I just want to show a little bit how it works.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.080]   So you can go to anywhere in the world and you can click different filters
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.920]   for hotel programs, whether it's Hilton or Marriott or Intercon,
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.000]   and see all the hotels in that region that are participating in that program.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.440]   So unfortunately, if you go to Bora Bora on award mapper,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.760]   you will only see three hotels. You won't see all of them.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.560]   Fortunately, I had done enough research to know what they were.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.080]   So I looked at Intercon, I looked at St.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.440]   Regis, I looked at the Conrad.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   And and basically the way I do those searches is on their websites.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.040]   So if you go to the Marriott website and you say,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.320]   I want to look at the St.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.840]   Regis Bora Bora, you can say flexible dates, which I love doing.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.680]   And I like to search for just one night.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   So you get a sense of all the availability.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.560]   Click use points and click view rates.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.800]   And what you'll get is a calendar of 30 days of availability.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.920]   And you can see which nights have availability.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   Right now, you can see that there are six nights for the rest of March,
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.880]   which, you know, it's the 18th.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.760]   So 50% of the days left in March still have availability.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.720]   And in April, there's 13 nights.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.080]   So a little bit less than half of April. It's not perfect.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.040]   It's not like you could stay for 10 days in a row.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.560]   But I will say when you search this availability, it changes a lot.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.440]   I remember right before we booked it, one of the days we wanted to stay was gone.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.080]   I waited six hours. It came back and I'll actually pull up.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.640]   So this is what the chart looked like.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.920]   If you're watching the video, you'll see it.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.360]   But when I was booking the chart for March, the first, third, fourth,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.520]   fifth, sixth, 10th, 12th, 15th, all the way to the 22nd were all available.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.440]   And then the next day, the 13th and the 14th opened up,
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.680]   which is when we ended up actually coming down here.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.240]   So already I was looking at 70 to 85,000 points a night thinking
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.840]   this is probably going to be the way we're going to do this trip.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.200]   But we stayed at the Conrad a few years ago and it was fantastic.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.600]   And while I don't have a lot of Hilton points,
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.040]   they often have transfer bonuses from Amex.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.920]   So I thought it'd be worth looking.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.320]   So I looked at the Conrad.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.120]   You check use points. You can hit view available dates.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.520]   And sometimes it's crazy.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.080]   So I'm looking right now.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.920]   And if you want to make a last minute trip for the next four days,
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.400]   it's 120,000 points per night, which is a pretty good deal.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.480]   If you want to go beyond that, it's one point three million points per night,
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.160]   which is a terrible, terrible use of Hilton points.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.560]   So you might find some great deals with Hilton if you're looking.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.280]   But like I said, those rooms sometimes can be as low as 700,
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.960]   800 dollars a night, which look, that is a really expensive hotel room.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   But this is also a really, really expensive place to be
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.680]   that can cost two or three thousand dollars a night.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.600]   So if you find a deal with dollars, it might be worth doing that for us.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   We were ended up able to take advantage of the Marriott deal
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.720]   where you book four nights, get the fifth free.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.400]   And it was about eighty five thousand a night.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.680]   So we paid about actually I know exactly.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.600]   We paid three hundred and forty thousand points.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.520]   And I'll pull up my confirmation right here, which shows
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.640]   there's three hundred forty thousand points for the whole stay.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.920]   And it was two thousand French Polynesian dollars, which is about 20 bucks.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.640]   So all in now, our flights were about one hundred eighty eight dollars of taxes.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.160]   And our hotel was about twenty dollars in fees.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.920]   We're at about two hundred dollars.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.240]   And our rooms otherwise were over two thousand a night.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.280]   So ten grand flights were over eleven thousand.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.200]   So this is a twenty thousand dollar vacation that we just booked
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.240]   last minute for less than two hundred dollars
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.520]   and about three hundred and forty thousand merit points
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.760]   and about two hundred twenty thousand chase point.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.440]   I think we use chase points or you could use Capital One or Amex.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.920]   One thing to share, if you're going to book, whether it's with points or dollars,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.280]   one of the things a lot of people want to know, you know,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.040]   if you're coming to a place like Bora Bora, is how do you get that upgrade?
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.520]   And the way I recommend thinking about that is
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.800]   there's a website called Flyer Talk.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.560]   And for almost every hotel you can book with miles, there's a thread.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.280]   And you can go way down the rabbit hole.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.400]   And I wouldn't recommend that.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.520]   But I would find the thread on the hotel you're trying to book at
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.120]   and just read a little bit, jump all the way to the end.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.400]   See the recent reports of what people have found.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.480]   A lot of these hotels, you can book a basic room, email them
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.080]   and upgrade it with dollars.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.480]   You might even get a better deal than sometimes the online price
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.800]   to upgrade your hotel.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.440]   And then you can also just take your chances if you have status
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.680]   or if you book it through a program or a travel agent or something like that.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.840]   You might be able to be waitlisted for an upgrade if it's available.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.080]   I'm actually working on an experiment right now with a travel company
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.160]   that would allow all listeners of this show to be able to book
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.840]   luxury properties around the world and get those kind of amenities.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.960]   So if you're listening right now and you're looking at booking with dollars
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.120]   at a higher end property anywhere in the world and you want things
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.520]   like free breakfast or upgrade or late checkout and stuff like that,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.840]   shoot me an email.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.320]   We could do a little beta test here and see if we can get you hooked up
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   on your next trip.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.840]   Wouldn't cost you anything extra.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.960]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.840]   Definitely do some research to see if there's a way you can get that upgrade.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.920]   I know in a place like Bora Bora, some hotels, the cheap room
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.680]   that you book with points and in our case was not an overwater bungalow,
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   but it was a villa on the beach.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.160]   It's funny if you talk to people who've been here a lot.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.120]   Some people say, you know what?
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.640]   Once the allure of the overwater bungalow wears off, the beach villa
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.960]   where you kind of have your own hammock and your own plunge pool
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.240]   and all that stuff, it's actually nicer.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.440]   Hasn't worn off for me yet.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.120]   I'm really enjoying jumping in the water from the balcony.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.480]   So one day maybe I'll get there, but certainly not there today.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.480]   So that covers flights to French Polynesia.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.240]   That covers your hotel in Bora Bora.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.760]   But there's one important thing I forgot to mention, and that's that Bora Bora
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.000]   is not located on the same island as Papiete, where all the international
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.080]   flights come in.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.960]   So you need to get there.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.720]   And the only way to really get there is to fly on Air Tahiti.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.520]   And the fares are relatively the same.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.280]   You book on their website.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.960]   They're not the cheapest, but they're not crazy expensive.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.200]   I think if you book really last minute, it might be about $400 round trip.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   But that's really your only option.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.480]   So there's no hacks.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.680]   There's no tricks.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.960]   But what is interesting to know is a lot of the flights
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.480]   that come down here during the day and leave as a red eye going back home
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.160]   or vice versa mean that you're either going to land late at night
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.560]   or you're going to take off really early in the morning.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.520]   And one hack, if you're able to swing it, is to book on an airline
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.760]   or even split and book on two airlines.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.400]   So you have an overnight flight each way.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.120]   Otherwise, if you have a super early morning flight
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.240]   going out or you land really late at night,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.520]   there are no flights to get to an island that leave after
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.600]   or leave early enough to make your connection.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.040]   So for us, we ended up getting in around 8 p.m.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.320]   And we spent one night at the Intercontinental in Tahiti.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.200]   It was actually fantastic.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.120]   We actually spent almost the whole next day and took an afternoon flight out.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.680]   The pool was amazing.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.320]   The snorkeling was great.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.880]   Overall, I had a great experience.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.680]   There's also a Hilton near the airport.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.760]   Both looked great.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.120]   So if you don't get in early enough to make a connection
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.120]   or if you're flying out early in the morning and you need to stay a night
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.680]   before, I could recommend both those places.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.600]   I won't go into it in this podcast, but there's also a ton of great hotels
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.680]   on the island of Maria, which is really close to the main island of Tahiti.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.360]   So if you want to split your trip up, check that out.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.840]   There's a lot of other islands here worth checking out.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.600]   But I just figured I'd focus on the trip we just planned and walk you through it all.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.880]   You all know I love credit card points.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.800]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.440]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.400]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.600]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.120]   on every purchase.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.320]   You can also load it on your partner's phone
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.800]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.480]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.840]   from over 5,000 cards.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.480]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America,
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.040]   or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.320]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.880]   every single Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.520]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.160]   you can do all of this without having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.640]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.640]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:46.000]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.960]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.200]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.080]   is actually so good for you.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.720]   And nothing showcases that better than Puer Tea.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.720]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.560]   and easiest ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.400]   Peak's Puer teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.080]   from 250-year-old tea trees rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.760]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides,
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.200]   heavy minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.560]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.080]   in pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.640]   in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.080]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   between the green Puer for mental clarity and energy, and the black Puer,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.160]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich,
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.360]   earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.760]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.080]   backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.880]   blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that Puer is more concentrated
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.560]   in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.080]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.880]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.520]   with 12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.760]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.680]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.880]   P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.720]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.440]   OK, I wanted to share two things.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.560]   One, I have a bunch of hacks that I've learned from two trips here.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.720]   And two, I just want to kind of compare and contrast the two places
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.560]   I've stayed in case you happen to be listening to this and thinking,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.000]   should I stay at the St. Regis?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.720]   Should I stay at the Conrad?
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.600]   First off, it doesn't matter which one you pick.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.480]   They're both going to be absolutely amazing.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.080]   But I figure, should you have the question, it might be worth sharing.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   So first off, if you're thinking of booking this, one hack that I've heard,
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.360]   a lot of people we've met at the resort have told us is that
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.480]   they actually booked their trip at Costco.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.400]   Now, I've never used Costco's travel program.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.000]   And when I tried to look online before recording this,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.240]   it looks like you have to call for availability.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.040]   But we talked to at least three couples that said they looked around
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.200]   and the best possible deal they found was booking through Costco.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.080]   And it included their flight from L.A.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.960]   And all they had to do was get to L.A.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.520]   So I'll definitely say try that out if you're looking at coming here
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   and taking an amazing vacation.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.160]   Some people actually booked packages that included their dinner.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   In a lot of places in the world, I would never want to make
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.560]   that kind of a commitment in advance to eat at the hotel every single night.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.680]   But if you're coming somewhere like Bora Bora, like the Maldives,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.560]   where the options outside of your resort are almost nothing.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.840]   In fact, I don't think we will eat outside of the resort the entire time
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.560]   we're here because there's nowhere to walk to.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.200]   Yes, you could take a boat, but then you'd need to charter a boat to come back.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.880]   It just seems like a lot of work.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.560]   So we've been eating at the resort and it's been fantastic.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.200]   So if that's the circumstance and there's a deal to book your dinner
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.960]   and that dinner is reasonably priced.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.080]   And let me remind you that all food here is expensive.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.000]   So I will say that while we've saved a ton of money
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   booking the flights with points and a ton of money booking the hotel with points,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.200]   there is no deal to get affordable food.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.400]   There are some hacks to save a little bit of money.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.680]   But at the end of the day, if you're coming to a place like this,
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.720]   you're just going to have to bite the bullet and spend money on food
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.160]   because it's the only way to do it and really enjoy yourself.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.480]   So I want to share a few of the differences between the two hotels
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.800]   I've stayed at here.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.840]   I'll go through it quickly,
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.280]   because most of you are probably not looking to plan a trip to Bora Bora
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.080]   in the near future and pick between these exact two hotels.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.680]   But maybe comparing them will help you guys
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.480]   think about ways to compare other hotels in the future.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.880]   So when I think about the two, what was obvious in advance
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.680]   was that the Conrad was newer.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.520]   It had only been open for a few years when we went in 2018.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.840]   And the St. Regis has been open a lot longer.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.040]   That doesn't mean a lot in terms of quality, because the St.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.160]   Regis is absolutely incredible.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.680]   But it does mean that you have a little bit of a different vibe.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.200]   The Conrad vibe was a little bit more modern and perfectly manicured.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   And there's Bluetooth speakers in the room that you can pair your phone with.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.000]   And the St.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.040]   Regis was just as luxurious, but maybe a little less modern.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.120]   A couple other fun quick hits.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.000]   The St. Regis has this beautiful lagoon with fish that you can snorkel in.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.320]   But around all the villas, the water is just beautiful, clear water.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.160]   You can see it behind me if you're watching the video.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.080]   Whereas the Conrad didn't have any special place to snorkel,
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.960]   but the entire villas were surrounded by coral reefs.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.840]   So the snorkeling right off of your balcony or your patio was incredible.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.560]   When it comes to upgrades, the Conrad has all about 30,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.880]   I think, rooms that aren't over water.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.800]   And I think the St.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.320]   Regis has closer to 10.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.160]   So the likelihood that there will be an extra room
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.920]   because there's just more of the St.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.000]   Regis rooms are over water bungalows.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.720]   I think you might have a higher likelihood of getting that upgrade.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.640]   The Conrad did have this amazingly hard mini golf course,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.000]   like maybe the hardest mini golf course you could ever imagine.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   But it was a lot of fun.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.200]   And at the St.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.360]   Regis and the Conrad, they both had what I wish every hotel had,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.000]   which was all the activities at the beach were free.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.080]   You want to borrow a stand up paddle board.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.200]   You want to borrow a Hobie Cat and go sailing.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.640]   You want to borrow one of those weird bikes
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.760]   that has like six foot tall inflatable wheels free.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.680]   You want snorkel equipment free.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.440]   You even want sunscreen. It's free.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.960]   So one of the nicest things about some of these higher end resorts is that
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.880]   you do, after paying for the expensive room,
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.400]   get a lot of the amenities on the property without having to pay extra.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.280]   Even at the St.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.040]   Regis, you can use all of the amenities of the spa, the steam room,
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.520]   the sauna, everything for free just by calling and reserving it.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.360]   Other than that, I think they both have amazing food.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.280]   It is expensive.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.640]   I'll just flag that for anyone listening.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.920]   Just be prepared.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.400]   But yeah, it's hard to go wrong.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.760]   I think the last point that I think a lot of people come to Bora Bora
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.800]   for this beautiful view of the mountain and the kind of volcanic
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.040]   looking structure in the middle of the island that isn't visible from the Conrad.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.760]   So if your dream is that like classic Bora Bora picture
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.360]   looking out your balcony to that view, you won't get that at the Conrad.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.760]   What you will get is a view of this beautiful, endless ocean.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.600]   Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.560]   I mean, I can't you can pick any resort here, and I'm sure it'd be totally fine.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.760]   So those were a few of the differences.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.800]   I hope that was helpful.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.440]   Finally, some quick hacks and tips for a trip to Bora Bora.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.560]   Some of these are applicable anywhere you go.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.880]   So one, definitely do an excursion to go out and swim
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.320]   with the sharks and the stingrays.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.480]   It's one of the coolest things you can ever do.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.920]   I thought it was amazing.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.840]   Also, don't pack as much sunscreen as you think you need.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.200]   Almost every resort, at least the two we've stayed at, have unlimited free
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.240]   sunscreen. Bring floats.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.480]   If you want to just sit out in the ocean off your patio.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.720]   There's some really cool, cheap, small packable floats.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.360]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.400]   We bought two of them or just make friends
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.280]   because a lot of people bring floats and don't want to carry them back.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.320]   So shout out to Sam and Gabe, who travel around the States in a van
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.760]   and bought an amazing pink flamingo and left it for us.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.040]   My wife got a ton of great use out of it.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.600]   So I really appreciate that.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   If you can for a place like this, do your overnight flights
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.200]   so that you don't have to spend an extra day on lodging.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.480]   Finally, if you're staying at a place where there's not a lot of stuff
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.000]   walkable or accessible, I always like to stop at the store somewhere,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.800]   whether it's on your layover or on the cab ride over,
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.480]   even sometimes at the airport, and just pick up a handful of snacks,
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.520]   maybe some drinks, especially if it's a place like this and you want some alcohol.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.800]   I could be really expensive at a resort.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.240]   Pick up a few things.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   I don't expect it to be all the food you'll need, all the drink you'll need,
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.080]   et cetera, but it does feel good sometimes to be like, oh, finally,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.440]   I got a three dollar beer instead of the eight dollar resort beer.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.920]   And maybe that's just a small
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.840]   like part of me that feels like I want a couple of wins on a trip
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   because I know it's really expensive.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.480]   But that's a tip I have, because a lot of times also
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.200]   there aren't some great snacks, you know, room service.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.680]   You might be able to get French fries as a side dish, but there aren't always
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.640]   just like a bag of chips or some granola or something small like that.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.760]   OK, that's all the hacks I have from this recent trip.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.640]   And hopefully this episode gives you some ideas to help you book your next trip.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.520]   But if you have any follow up questions or feedback,
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.480]   please don't hesitate to shoot me an email.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.520]   Chris at all the hacks dot com.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.680]   I will try to reply to every single one.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.920]   And I hope you got a chance to check out some of the photos
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.440]   and videos from this trip on Instagram or YouTube.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.040]   I'll link to both of those in the show notes.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.560]   Finally, I'm doing an episode with Julia from Geo Breeze Travel,
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.280]   who's an expert in all things, credit cards, points and miles.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.640]   We're recording soon.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   So if you have any questions you want us to tackle on that topic,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.840]   please send them my way as soon as you can.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.520]   Thank you so much for joining me this week.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.360]   See you next week.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.880]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.640]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.520]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.960]   in Apple podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.680]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.240]   or just want to say hi, I'm Chris at all the hacks dot com
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.400]   or at Hutchins on Twitter.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.440]   That's it for this week.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.360]   I'll see you next week.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:41:01.400]   I want to tell you about another podcast
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.920]   I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.240]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.960]   building to early retirement.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.800]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.240]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.760]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.800]   It's hosted by my good friend Andrew, who truly believes that everyone
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.320]   in this world can build wealth.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.080]   And his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.000]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.600]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.960]   that will blow your mind.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.520]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35 percent of millennials
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.360]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.960]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.960]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.560]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.520]   with your money and grow your wealth.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.560]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcast, Spotify
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.160]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
