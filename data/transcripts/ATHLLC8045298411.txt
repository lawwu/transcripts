[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.060]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who joined the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.620]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.220]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.140]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.300]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.180]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.460]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.780]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.020]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.660]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.460]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.660]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.940]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to do something different today.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.820]   In fact, if you're watching this on YouTube, you'll already know why because
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.720]   I'm recording this from an overwater bungalow at the St.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.980]   Regis in Bora Bora.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.900]   These views are amazing.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.780]   Now, so many of the listener questions I get are about how to maximize your
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020]   points and miles for amazing redemptions.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.740]   And I wanted to take this episode to share how we ended up taking a trip that
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.780]   would have otherwise cost me and Amy over $20,000 for less than $1,500 in points.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.580]   And I'm actually going to walk through all the steps to search for flights,
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.580]   transfer points, and book hotels.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.300]   So you can use those tips to get the best deal possible on your next trip.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.080]   Two quick things before we get started.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.920]   One, if you're new to the show and you want to get a good foundation for
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.840]   travel hacking, points, and miles, I'd recommend going back and listening to
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.560]   episode one with Lee Rowan on travel hacking, episode three with Brad Barrett
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.240]   on credit card points and miles, or episode 27 with the points guy himself,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.160]   Brian Kelly, and two, if you're already thinking that a trip like this is out
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.640]   of reach for you, hold on, I want to read you this amazing email I just got a few
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.300]   weeks ago, Chris, my name's Zach.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.220]   I'm a medical student currently finishing up my second year and have been a fan of
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.260]   your podcast since the first episode came out, I really like what you're doing and
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.320]   have been putting a lot of the hacks you and your guests talk about to work.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.420]   As you can imagine, money is incredibly tight for a medical student.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.340]   However, my girlfriend and I put some of your credit card signup bonus and
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.380]   flight hotel point hacks to work.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.260]   And we were able to use almost exclusively points and miles to cover round trip
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.080]   flights and four to five star hotels for a 10 day trip to Europe to celebrate our
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.920]   four year anniversary in a few months.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.380]   We ended up turning 350,000 points and miles from credit card signup bonuses
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.040]   and other necessary purchases into flights and hotels that we calculated
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.960]   equals about $7,200 of value.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.100]   I think this is proof that what you're talking about works for literally anyone,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.500]   even a medical student who has basically no money.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.560]   Thanks again for what you're doing.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.080]   And I look forward to listening to more episodes of all the hacks in the future.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.800]   So Zach, thank you so much for writing that in.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.920]   I am so excited for your trip and I just hope that helps anyone listening know
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.160]   that these hacks are really accessible and I hope they help you take an amazing
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.520]   trip.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   And while I'm going to walk you through everything I did for this trip on the
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.880]   podcast on YouTube, I'm actually going to share some footage from the trip and
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   I'll also share my screen as I walk through some of the booking steps.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   So if you want to watch that, head on over to all the hacks.com/49 because this
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.840]   is episode 49 and check it out.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.480]   And if you have any followup questions or want some clarification, don't hesitate
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.000]   to shoot me an email, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So first off, how did this trip even come to be?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, if you've been listening, you might know that my wife and I are expecting
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400]   our second child in June this year.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.040]   So we were trying to think what kind of a vacation we could take before the
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.960]   craziness of having two children come.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.240]   And my parents kindly volunteered to watch our daughter for one week and told
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.920]   us this week would work best.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.960]   So we started thinking about what we could possibly do with one week off.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.760]   And we had all these points that we wanted to burn them on something amazing.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.560]   And so we started looking and we kind of identified, we didn't want to go too
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.320]   crazy far just for the fact that we only had a week.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.480]   So it was where can we go on flights for less than 10 hours and the options,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.680]   unfortunately, from the West coast, a lot of the Caribbean is really hard to get to.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.360]   So we looked at places like Turks and Caicos, so we even looked at Costa Rica
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   and it just seemed like it was going to be a really tough trip to take multiple
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.120]   layovers to get to where you wanted to.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.800]   And it just wasn't that convenient.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.920]   And we'd come to Bora Bora back in 2018 and we stayed at the Conrad and I'll
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.000]   talk about the differences between that and the St.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.480]   Regis in a bit, but it was so amazing that we thought, well, we might as well
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.280]   just look to see if that's possible.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.720]   So we kind of had an idea from the beginning of let's just take the
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.520]   most amazing, relaxing vacation.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   We can, we know Bora Bora is one nonstop flight.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.960]   It's about eight hours from San Francisco.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.400]   And then you take a small plane from Papiete to here, which you could probably
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.080]   hear flying above me right now.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.440]   And that is exactly what we thought we would do.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.320]   So, so that was the idea was from the beginning, can we make Bora Bora
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.680]   possible with points, with miles?
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.480]   Actually, before we get into everything, I just want to paint a
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.560]   picture of how amazing this place is.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.240]   My wife and I have been on a lot of trips and we always say next time
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.360]   we're going to go somewhere new.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.040]   But Bora Bora and Japan are two places that we always say, you know what?
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.160]   Let's just go back there again, because it's so incredible.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.040]   The water is the clearest thing you could possibly imagine.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.880]   Resorts have hammocks that just sit out in the ocean.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   So you can just lie, relax and enjoy just the most beautiful views.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.240]   There's something super special about having a bungalow that sits over the
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.560]   water where you can jump off your balcony straight into the water.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.920]   You get bikes and you can ride them all around.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.120]   It's like the most relaxing manicured place to just, everyone is so friendly.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.640]   I just, it's hard to be more excited about a place you can
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.520]   go on vacation than here.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.200]   And one of the things I really love is that I've been to a few resorts sometimes
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.480]   in Mexico or in the Caribbean, where it just feels like you took a bunch of
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.240]   American culture and you just plopped it down in the middle of a nice beach.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.520]   And this is totally different than that.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.240]   French Polynesia has a very distinct culture and most of the resorts here
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.120]   try to infuse that culture into the resort.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.560]   So you really get a feel for it.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.680]   Whether it's activities, excursions, doing a Polynesian night, different
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.560]   types of food that you can try.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   The staff at most of these resorts is like the most friendly people ever,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.840]   and you can spend time talking to them about their culture and understand it.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.280]   And so I think that's another part of travel that's really important
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.560]   to us that you get to do here.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.720]   I think that's it.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.800]   I just wanted to paint a picture of what an amazing magical
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.600]   experience a trip like this can be.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.520]   I know a lot of people say it's once in a lifetime, but the reason I love
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.000]   points, the reason I love miles, the reason I love all the hacks is because
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.520]   there's a way to make it possible way more frequently than once in a lifetime
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   without having to spend the money it would otherwise cost.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.160]   If you're watching this on video, I have overlaid a bunch of pictures
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.120]   and videos, so you could really get a sense of how cool this place is.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.560]   If you want to go check out the video, you can see all that.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.960]   Or if you head on over to my Instagram, just Chris Hutchins, I'll try to post
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.680]   some photos and videos so you can get a sense of how really magical this place is.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.800]   So now that we know where we're going, I want to start looking at how we can get
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.640]   there, and then I'll look at where to stay.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   So we want to go to Papiete, which is the main international
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.280]   airport in French Polynesia.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.440]   So I like to start all of these searches by going to flightconnections.com.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.080]   And I do that because they show you all the routes that you can
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.920]   get to a certain airport from.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.560]   So for Papiete, you can see that in the US, the only routes are from San
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.800]   Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.440]   Now for us trying to take a week trip, which is going to be a short trip, flying
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.880]   from San Francisco to Honolulu and then down to Papiete, it's just not in the cards.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.120]   So we're really looking at SFO and LAX flights.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.640]   So now that I know what the routes are, I first like to go see how much are the
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.160]   flights.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.120]   And the way I typically do that is not looking for my home destination, but just
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.240]   looking at the specific nonstop flights, because you get a sense of what the
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.200]   international prices are going to be.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.840]   So I'm going to go to Google flights and I'm going to search for San Francisco or
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.520]   LAX.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.960]   And so you can search multiple froms and multiple twos at Google flights.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:30.240]   And so you type SFO and then the easiest way to do it is once you hit comma, Google
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.200]   flights saves that.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   And so you can type SFO comma, LAX comma, and then you search Papiete.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.160]   Now, unfortunately, Google flights will not let you search for nonstop flights from
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.920]   the get go.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.640]   So you have to click into a search and then filter to nonstop.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.720]   So now that I've filtered to nonstop, I'm going to look at round trip flights from
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.880]   SFO or LAX to Papiete.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.880]   I'm going to go in and search by clicking on the date field.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.560]   You can actually in the bottom left say, show me five day trips, and you can
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.680]   actually look at how much these tickets are going to cost.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.760]   And what I'm seeing is that on most days for the rest of March and a lot of days in
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:13.000]   April, the round trip tickets are 550 to 600, 700 dollars, which is pretty
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.120]   reasonable for a long distance international flight.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.760]   So out the gate, I'm thinking, wow, I don't even know if I want to use miles,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.960]   but, you know, it's a short trip.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.000]   A lot of the flights are overnight.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.160]   I've got a lot of miles.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.880]   What about business?
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   Every now and then I look at business internationally and it's really not that
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.320]   much more.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.360]   In this case, I'm going to look and I already know what I'm going to see.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.320]   It's going to be almost five grand or more, which for me just makes it
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.480]   completely off the table.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.560]   So at this point, I've kind of said, all right, I'm going to fly economy or I'm
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.680]   going to see if there's miles available for business.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.160]   Obviously, if the miles are available for business and it's a good deal, that's what
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.000]   I would prefer to do.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.360]   So now that I know the flight routes there are, right, you can click through Google
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.120]   flights and you can see, okay, well, United has a flight, Air Tahiti Nui has a
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.840]   flight, Air France has a flight.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.600]   Keep in mind that for a lot of international destinations, the day you fly on might
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.640]   actually change what airlines have flights.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.600]   They might not all have flights the same day.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.400]   So if you're clicking through days, you'll actually see that on some days, an airline
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.800]   called French B actually flies from San Francisco.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.360]   It's the airline we flew down to French Polynesia the last time we came and I
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.480]   thought it was a great experience.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.160]   So definitely click around to make sure you know what airlines are looking for.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.320]   Now I can tell you in advance that French B doesn't have a mileage program that lets
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.400]   you book award tickets.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.640]   So I'm going to start looking first on United.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.240]   Now, if you search SFO to PPT and you search a date, you click award travel.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.320]   You're going to get a list of flights for that day, but you're also going to get an
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.160]   award calendar at the top and if you click under that, you'll see view 30 day
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.120]   calendar and you can actually see all the different award prices.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.720]   So you'll see that on every Sunday and really Tuesday, almost all the flights
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.080]   United flies for the rest of March and into April.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:11.560]   Almost every week you can find a flight for 35,000 or 37,000 miles, but knowing
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.200]   that the flights are only 600 round trip and if you dig into the one-way prices,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.360]   you'll learn they're about 380 going down, maybe 280 or 300 coming back.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.280]   I'm not sure I'd rather use 35,000 miles for the ticket, but if I look in business,
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.600]   you'll see that 70,000 points going down, United has availability on the next four
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.440]   Sundays and you can go search round trip, see when it's available on the way coming
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.120]   back. So now all of a sudden I've said, okay, that's low inventory.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.960]   I know that that's one of the lowest prices you'll see.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.920]   United even highlights it in green if it's the lowest price in the month.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.600]   So now we're like, okay, so United has some tickets coming down.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   You can also check the other airlines.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.040]   So I said French B doesn't have anything, but there's also Air France and there's
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.000]   Air Tahiti Nui.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.280]   So you can go through the Air France website and do it for Air Tahiti Nui.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.400]   While I'm sure you don't have Air Tahiti Nui in miles, you probably maybe have or
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.520]   have access from a transfer partner to American who are partners.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.560]   So you could book for American.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.000]   So you can actually search those flights on their websites.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.800]   I have a subscription to a website called Expert Flyer and that site lets you search
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.520]   award inventory for a lot of flights.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.040]   So I can actually go there and just say I'm looking for LAX to PPT and do a search.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.840]   One of the great features they have is that you can search three days before and three
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.520]   days after. So you can search seven days at a time and I can go in and search Air Tahiti
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.960]   Nui and I can say I'm looking for a business award and it'll come back and show you.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.200]   Here's what we found.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.280]   Now, I can tell you that it's hard to find award availability far out in advance.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.240]   A lot of airlines don't release all the inventory.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.360]   But when you're trying to book something somewhat last minute, sometimes you get
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.520]   really, really lucky. So in the case of United, you saw that, you know, we got award
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.800]   availability on business class seats four days in a row on Air Tahiti Nui.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.880]   It looks like I'm currently looking and there's nothing to get down.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.600]   But coming back, if you want to leave on the 30th of March, there's five seats back
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.360]   to L.A. So maybe that's an option.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.720]   And the availability changes all the time.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.160]   Expert Flyer actually lets you set alerts to say, hey, if something pops up, let me
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.120]   know. I'll save you the looking.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.240]   Air France had no availability, so I'll just skip over it.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.600]   But if you really wanted to book that Air Tahiti Nui flight, you can actually go on
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.680]   American Airlines's website and you can just search PPT to L.A.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   X. You can say book with miles and it'll show up.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.520]   I happen to know that it's going to be 80,000 miles to book that flight.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.920]   And so from my perspective, I'd rather just use the 72,000 United miles.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.440]   However, one of the things to know is that when there's availability on an airline,
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.080]   that means that you can book it from any of their partners.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.320]   So that's where a search like Point.me really comes in to benefit you.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.680]   So I'm going to go do this search on Point.me and I already did it, but I have it
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   pulled up in front of me.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.120]   And what happens is they say, yep, we found the availability on United.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.040]   This was for March 20th.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.880]   And when you look at the options to book it, they say, yeah, you can book it with
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.480]   United with 72,800 miles, but you can also book it with Air Canada for 55,000
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.800]   miles. And Air Canada happens to be a transfer partner of Amex Capital One and
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.120]   Chase. And let me tell you, I love Air Canada as a mileage program.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.000]   The aero plan program has some really great spots of redemption just like this.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.360]   So now I'm thinking, OK, whether you have Amex points, Cap One points, Chase points,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.880]   or you happen to be someone with Air Canada points, that's 55,000 miles down.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.760]   You can find the return 55,000 back.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.520]   That's one hundred and ten thousand miles for your trip.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.720]   So what is one hundred ten thousand miles worth?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.160]   Well, if you know that the business class flight would have been about fifty seven
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.600]   hundred dollars, then that's five cents a mile.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.040]   To put that in perspective, if you were using a card that earns you three points
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.520]   per dollar on travel expenses and you can get five cents per mile, that's like
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.440]   getting 15 percent cash back.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.400]   So I think that's an amazing deal.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.960]   And in fact, that is exactly what we did to come down here.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.440]   We got Air Canada miles and we used them to book United business class seats for
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.880]   one hundred ten thousand miles each.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.160]   And the taxes, as you could see, were thirty six dollars.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.560]   And it's really easy. You can create an account on Air Canada's website.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.320]   You can go search for the flights.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.960]   And once you find the availability, you can go to chase or cap one and do the
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.920]   transfer. Usually you just log out, log back in and boom, there they show up right
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   there. Make it really easy to book.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.800]   So that's how we got here. We booked it through on United in business with Air
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.200]   Canada miles. It ended up being thirty six dollars each way per person, whereas
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.680]   the two business class tickets would have been over eleven thousand dollars.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.800]   So that's flights.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.560]   That is how I typically do all of this.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.920]   Searching point dot me is a great place.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.600]   You could even start there if you want.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.280]   It's pretty great at searching across lots of different travel sites.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.160]   The challenge is they don't have any flexible date search.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.920]   So when you go to United's website, you can look at a 30 day calendar and get a
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   sense of whether there's something great one day with point dot me.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.400]   You've got to go search a day and then the next day and then the next day.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.280]   So when there's only a few options of flights and you're flexible on dates, I
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.360]   like to start searching on the airlines websites.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.880]   But if you're pretty strict on dates and you're going somewhere with lots of
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.720]   options like the US to Europe, it could definitely be easier to search on point
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.560]   dot me. But keep in mind, sometimes there's strange things that happen where
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:38.320]   it might be availability from San Francisco to Paris, but not from Paris to,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.560]   let's say, Nice, France.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.400]   And it might be a really cheap flight.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.200]   So definitely make sure that when you're looking for award flights, you're not
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.560]   just looking at the whole trip.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.200]   You might be looking at the major leg that you really want, and you could maybe
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   buy a cheap $1,500 ticket on either end to make make it all the way to your
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.840]   destination.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.000]   Hey, everybody, I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with point dot me
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.840]   my favorite award search tool to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.520]   first month of their standard plan.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:14.600]   If you go to all the hacks.com/point me and use the promo code hacks again, all
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.960]   the hacks.com/p o i n t m e or find the link in the show notes.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.240]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with points, you
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.200]   all know, I love credit card points.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.000]   So I'm excited to be partnering with card pointers today, which is one of my
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.840]   favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.000]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.640]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.240]   purchase.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.640]   You can also load it on your partner's phone.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.280]   So they always know the best cards to use.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.240]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.080]   over 5,000 cards.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.760]   And they also track and help you use your Amex chase bank of America or city bank
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.520]   offers to save even more money every day.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.320]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.440]   chase offer in just one click.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.840]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.120]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.160]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.520]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:35.440]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.520]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.400]   So now let's talk about hotels.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.760]   Once I figured out we could get flights and I knew that there were a lot of
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.560]   different days and, and actually, you know, I'm speaking in Bora Bora right now.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.480]   So when I was looking at this, United had a business class, three different
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   days in a single week.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.880]   So I kind of knew I had a little bit of flexibility.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.960]   We probably had 12 days and we wanted to go for six.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.040]   So I kind of had a little bit of wiggle room.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.600]   So I said, great.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.040]   Now I know that the flights are there.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.960]   Let's pause and let's look at hotels.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.480]   And I think one of the first things to do when you're looking at hotels is just
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.120]   to get a sense of what are the rates, because sometimes miles and points for
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.960]   hotels don't make a lot of sense.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.480]   Sometimes I like Google for hotels.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.880]   Their hotel search is pretty good.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.040]   Lots of websites to look for hotels, whichever one has the right filters.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.360]   You like go for it.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.640]   You could use trip advisor.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.760]   You could use kayak.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.960]   It really just matters what you like right now.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.560]   We're not trying to book a hotel.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.880]   We're just trying to search.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.360]   So if I go on and search Bora Bora on Google hotels, you'll see that there are a
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.000]   lot of hotels that come up, you know, fortunately for Bora Bora, there aren't an
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.760]   unlimited number.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.000]   There's like eight or nine hotels that are kind of high end, go take a luxury
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.640]   vacation.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.080]   And so I can look at them and say, okay, well look, the Conrad $722 a night, St
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.520]   Regis, $1,200 a night.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.840]   And I'm here looking March 21st to 26.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.520]   Once you find a hotel, one of the nice things that Google let you do, and it
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.400]   doesn't work until you pick the hotel.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.160]   But in this example, if you go and click view prices on a Google hotels listing,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.400]   now you can actually go to the dates and they'll say best prices for one night
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.120]   stay, and they'll show you all the prices.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.280]   And so you can actually look out and say, wow, you know, there are some days that
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.640]   are ridiculously expensive.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.080]   Like I'm looking right now, April 4th, the average rate for a night at the St
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.920]   Regis in Bora Bora is $3,500 to $3,000 a night, which means a five night stay is
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.880]   going to cost you almost 20 grand.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.400]   When I actually booked this trip, the rate per night was about $2,100.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   For me, I was like, wow, there's no world where I could get comfortable spending
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.320]   $10,000 on a vacation.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.080]   So it's time to look at points.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.320]   And fortunately in Bora Bora, there's two intercontinental hotels.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.840]   There's a Conrad, there's a St Regis, all you different Hilton, Marriott, or IHG
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.720]   points, all which have transfer partners.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.680]   So when I'm trying to find the award hotels where I might get the best deal, I
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.760]   love this site, awardmapper.com.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.320]   If you're watching the video, you'll see that I actually have a pulled up in
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.200]   Paris because there's a bit of a bug on the site right now when it comes to Bora
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.520]   Bora.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.400]   But I just want to show a little bit how it works.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.720]   So you can go to anywhere in the world and you can click different filters for
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.520]   hotel programs, whether it's Hilton or Marriott or Intercon and see all the
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   hotels in that region that are participating in that program.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.920]   So unfortunately, if you go to Bora Bora on award mapper, you will only see three
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.320]   hotels.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.280]   You won't see all of them.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.080]   Fortunately, I had done enough research to know what they were.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.640]   So I looked at Intercon, I looked at St Regis, I looked at the Conrad and, and
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.960]   basically the way I do those searches is on their websites.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.080]   So if you go to the Marriott website and you say, I want to look at the St Regis
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.320]   Bora Bora, you can say flexible dates, which I love doing.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.160]   And I like to search for just one night.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.040]   So you get a sense of all the availability, click use points and click view rates.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.280]   And what you'll get is a calendar of 30 days of availability.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.880]   And you can see which nights have availability right now.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.840]   You can see that there are six nights for the rest of March, which, you know, it's
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.360]   the 18th.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.280]   So 50% of the days left in March still have availability.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   And in April, there's 13 nights.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.520]   So a little bit less than half of April.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.600]   It's not perfect.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.120]   It's not like you could stay for 10 days in a row, but I will say when you search
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.000]   this availability, it changes a lot.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.920]   I remember right before we booked it, one of the days we wanted to stay was gone.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.000]   I waited six hours.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.560]   It came back and I'll actually pull up.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.120]   So this is what the chart looked like.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.400]   If you're watching the video, you'll see it.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.560]   But when I was booking the chart for March, the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.040]   10th, 12th, 15th, all the way to the 22nd, we're all available.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.760]   And then the next day, the 13th and the 14th opened up, which is when we ended up
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.840]   actually coming down here.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.720]   So already I was looking at 70 to 85,000 points a night thinking, this is probably
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.360]   going to be the way we're going to do this trip.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.680]   But we stayed at the Conrad a few years ago and it was fantastic.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.880]   And while I don't have a lot of Hilton points, they often have transfer bonuses
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.040]   from Amex, so I thought it'd be worth looking.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.640]   So I looked at the Conrad, you check use points, you can hit view available dates
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.840]   and sometimes it's crazy.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.680]   So I'm looking right now and if you want to make a last minute trip for the next
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.880]   four days, it's 120,000 points per night, which is a pretty good deal.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.560]   If you want to go beyond that, it's 1.3 million points per night, which is a
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.640]   terrible, terrible use of Hilton points.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.040]   So you might find some great deals with Hilton if you're looking.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:36.320]   But like I said, those rooms sometimes can be as low as 700, $800 a night, which
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.160]   look, that is a really expensive hotel room, but this is also a really, really
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   expensive place to be that can cost two or $3,000 a night.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.400]   So if you find a deal with dollars, it might be worth doing that.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.360]   For us, we were ended up able to take advantage of the Marriott deal where you
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.200]   book four nights, get the fifth free.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.920]   And it was about 85,000 a night.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.000]   So we paid about, actually I know exactly, we paid 340,000 points and I'll pull up
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.160]   my confirmation right here, which shows there's 340,000 points for the whole stay.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.440]   And it was 2000 French Polynesian dollars, which is about 20 bucks.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.760]   So all in now, our flights were about $188 of taxes and our
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.680]   hotel was about $20 in fees.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.760]   We're at about $200 and our rooms otherwise were over 2000 a night.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.800]   So 10 grand flights were over 11,000.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:32.920]   So this is a $20,000 vacation that we just booked a last minute for less than
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:39.240]   $200 and about 340,000 merit points and about 220,000 chase point.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.920]   I think we use chase points or you could use Capital One or Amex.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.800]   One thing to share, if you're going to book, whether it's with points or
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.960]   dollars, one of the things a lot of people want to know, you know, if you're
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.560]   coming to a place like Bora Bora, is how do you get that upgrade?
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.880]   And the way I recommend thinking about that is there's a website called Flyer
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.400]   Talk and for almost every hotel you can book with miles, there's a thread and
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.600]   you can go way down the rabbit hole and I wouldn't recommend that, but I would
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.200]   find the thread on the hotel you're trying to book at and just read a little
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.400]   bit, jump all the way to the end, see the recent reports of what people have
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.880]   found.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.600]   A lot of these hotels, you can book a basic room, email them and upgrade it
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.400]   with dollars.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.520]   You might even get a better deal than sometimes the online price to upgrade
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.200]   your hotel.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.000]   And then you can also just take your chances.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.560]   If you have status or if you book it through a program or a travel agent or
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.640]   something like that, you might be able to be waitlisted for an upgrade if it's
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.280]   available.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.920]   I'm actually working on an experiment right now with a travel company that
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.800]   would allow all listeners of this show to be able to book luxury properties
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.320]   around the world and get those kind of amenities.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.440]   So if you're listening right now and you're looking at booking with dollars
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.000]   at a higher end property anywhere in the world and you want things like free
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.240]   breakfast or upgrade or late checkout and stuff like that, shoot me an email.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.960]   We could do a little beta test here and see if we can get you hooked up on your
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.560]   next trip.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.280]   Wouldn't cost you anything extra.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.400]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.360]   Definitely do some research to see if there's a way you can get that upgrade.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.760]   I know in a place like Bora Bora, some hotels, the cheap room that you book
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.560]   with points and in our case was not an overwater bungalow, but it was a villa
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.160]   on the beach.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.280]   It's funny if you talk to people who've been here a lot, some people say, you
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:18.600]   know what?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.400]   Once the allure of the overwater bungalow wears off, the beach villa where you
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.520]   kind of have your own hammock and your own plunge pool and all that stuff, it's
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.280]   actually nicer.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.920]   Hasn't worn off for me yet.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.600]   I'm really enjoying jumping in the water from the balcony.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.960]   So one day maybe I'll get there, but certainly not there today.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.480]   So that covers flights to French Polynesia, that covers your hotel in Bora
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.840]   Bora, but there's a one important thing I forgot to mention, and that's that Bora
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.520]   Bora is not located on the same island as Papiete where all the international
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.240]   flights come in.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.440]   So you need to get there.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.760]   And the only way to really get there is to fly on Air Tahiti and the fares are
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.040]   relatively the same.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.480]   You book on their website.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.440]   They're not the cheapest, but they're not crazy expensive.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.200]   I think if you book really last minute, it might be about $400 round trip, but
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.560]   that's really your only option.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.800]   So there's no hacks, there's no tricks, but what is interesting to know is a lot
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.560]   of the flights that come down here during the day and leave as a red eye going back
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.960]   home or vice versa, mean that you're either going to land late at night or
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.760]   you're going to take off really early in the morning.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.000]   And one hack, if you're able to swing it, is to book on an airline or even split
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.200]   and book on two airlines so you have an overnight flight each way.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.880]   Otherwise, if you have a super early morning flight going out or you land
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.200]   really late at night, there are no flights to get to an island that leave after or
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.120]   leave early enough to make your connection.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.800]   So for us, we ended up getting in around 8 PM and we spent one night at the
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.840]   intercontinental in Tahiti.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.560]   It was actually fantastic.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.640]   We actually spent almost the whole next day and took an afternoon flight out.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.160]   The pool was amazing.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.400]   The snorkeling was great.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.320]   Overall, I had a great experience.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.120]   There's also a Hilton near the airport.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.160]   Both looked great.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.840]   So if you don't get in early enough to make a connection or if you're flying out
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.320]   early in the morning and you need to stay a night before, I could recommend both
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.120]   those places.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.280]   I won't go into it in this podcast, but there's also a ton of great hotels on the
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.120]   island of Morea, which is really close to the main island of Tahiti.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.840]   So if you want to split your trip up, check that out.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.720]   There's a lot of other islands here worth checking out, but I just figured I'd focus
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.120]   on the trip we just planned and walk you through it all.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.680]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.400]   I get it.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.600]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.000]   hang.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.040]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.400]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.480]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.520]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.360]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.920]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.280]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.960]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.360]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:12.880]   yours.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.800]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.040]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.720]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.400]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.080]   it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.000]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.360]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.640]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.480]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.240]   Okay, I wanted to share two things.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.320]   One, I have a bunch of hacks that I've learned from two trips here.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.080]   And two, I just want to kind of compare and contrast the two places I've stayed in
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.440]   case you happen to be listening to this and thinking, should I stay at the St.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:16.760]   Regis?
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.920]   Should I stay at the Conrad?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.280]   First off, it doesn't matter which one you pick.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.080]   They're both going to be absolutely amazing.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.840]   But I figure, should you have the question, it might be worth sharing.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.360]   So first off, if you're thinking of booking this, one hack that I've heard a lot of
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.400]   people we've met at the resort have told us is that they actually booked their trip
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.240]   at Costco.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.160]   Now, I've never used Costco's travel program.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.680]   And when I tried to look online before recording this, it looks like you have to
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.000]   call for availability.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.400]   But we talked to at least three couples that said they looked around and the best
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.240]   possible deal they found was booking through Costco, and it included their flight
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.840]   from L.A.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.520]   And all they had to do was get to L.A.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.960]   So I'll definitely say try that out if you're looking at coming here and taking an
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.040]   amazing vacation.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.880]   Some people actually booked packages that included their dinner.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.680]   In a lot of places in the world, I would never want to make that kind of a
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.280]   commitment in advance to eat at the hotel every single night.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.920]   But if you're coming somewhere like Bora Bora, like the Maldives, where the options
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.280]   outside of your resort are almost nothing.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.960]   In fact, I don't think we will eat outside of the resort the entire time we're here
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.320]   because there's nowhere to walk to.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.920]   Yes, you could take a boat, but then you'd need to charter a boat to come back.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.320]   It just seems like a lot of work.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   So we've been eating at the resort and it's been fantastic.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.440]   So if that's the circumstance and there's a deal to book your dinner and that dinner
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.720]   is reasonably priced.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.840]   And let me remind you that all food here is expensive.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.520]   So I will say that while we've saved a ton of money booking the flights with
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.120]   points and a ton of money booking the hotel with points, there is no deal to get
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.880]   affordable food.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.920]   There are some hacks to save a little bit of money, but at the end of the day, if
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.520]   you're coming to a place like this, you're just going to have to bite the bullet and
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.880]   spend money on food because it's the only way to do it and really enjoy yourself.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.760]   So I want to share a few of the differences between the two hotels I've stayed at
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.160]   here.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   I'll go through it quickly because most of you are probably not looking to plan a trip
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.720]   to Bora Bora in the near future and pick between these exact two hotels, but maybe
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.760]   comparing them will help you guys think about ways to compare other hotels in the
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.160]   future.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.920]   So when I think about the two, what was obvious in advance was that the Conrad was
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.320]   newer.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.760]   It had only been open for a few years when we went in 2018 and the St.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.520]   Regis has been open a lot longer.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.720]   That doesn't mean a lot in terms of quality because the St.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.880]   Regis is absolutely incredible.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.360]   But it does mean that you have a little bit of a different vibe.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.320]   The Conrad vibe was a little bit more modern and perfectly manicured and there's
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.680]   Bluetooth speakers in the room that you can pair your phone with and the St.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   Regis was just as luxurious, but maybe a little less modern.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.440]   A couple other fun quick hits.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.680]   The St.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.920]   Regis has this beautiful lagoon with fish that you can snorkel in, but around all
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.000]   the villas, the water is just beautiful, clear water.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.800]   You can see it behind me if you're watching the video, whereas the Conrad
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.880]   didn't have any special place to snorkel, but the entire villas were surrounded by
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.680]   coral reefs.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.520]   So the snorkeling right off of your balcony or your patio was incredible.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.800]   When it comes to upgrades, the Conrad has about 30, I think, rooms that aren't
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.600]   over water.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.520]   And I think the St.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.800]   Regis has closer to 10.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:25.320]   So the likelihood that there will be an extra room because there's just more of
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:25.640]   the St.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.720]   Regis rooms are over water bungalows.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.440]   I think you might have a higher likelihood of getting that upgrade.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.840]   The Conrad did have this amazingly hard mini golf course, like maybe the hardest
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.680]   mini golf course you could ever imagine, but it was a lot of fun.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.920]   And at the St.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.960]   Regis and the Conrad, they both had what I wish every hotel had, which was all the
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.720]   activities at the beach were free.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.600]   You want to borrow a standup paddleboard.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.920]   You want to borrow a Hobie cat and go sailing.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.480]   You want to borrow one of those weird bikes that has like six foot tall inflatable
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.480]   wheels free.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.320]   You want snorkel equipment free.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.680]   You even want sunscreen.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.160]   It's free.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.200]   So one of the nicest things about some of these higher end resorts is that you do,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.760]   after paying for the expensive room, get a lot of the amenities on the property
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.120]   without having to pay extra.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.000]   Even at the St.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.200]   Regis, you can use all of the amenities of the spa, the steam room, the sauna,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   everything for free just by calling and reserving it.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.040]   Other than that, I think they're, they both have amazing food.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.960]   It is expensive.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.320]   I'll just flag that for anyone listening.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.360]   Just be prepared.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.080]   But yeah, it's hard to go wrong.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.840]   I think the last point that I think a lot of people come to Bora Bora for this
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.480]   beautiful view of the mountain and the kind of volcanic looking structure in the
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.760]   middle of the Island that isn't visible from the Conrad.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.920]   So if your dream is that like classic Bora Bora picture, looking out your balcony to
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.080]   that view, you won't get that at the Conrad.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.400]   What you will get is a view of this beautiful, endless ocean that you, yeah,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.280]   it's unbelievable.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.880]   I mean, I can't, you could king pick any resort here and I'm sure it'd be totally
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.280]   fine.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.480]   So those were a few of the differences.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.160]   I hope that was helpful.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.120]   Finally, some quick hacks and tips for a trip to Bora Bora.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.280]   Some of these are applicable anywhere you go.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.360]   So one, definitely do an excursion to go out and swim with the sharks and the
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.000]   stingrays.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   It's one of the coolest things you can ever do.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.360]   I thought it was amazing.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.520]   Also, don't pack as much sunscreen as you think you need.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.920]   Almost every resort, at least the two we've stayed at, have unlimited free
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.640]   sunscreen.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.680]   Bring floats.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.600]   If you want to just sit out in the ocean off your patio, there's some really cool,
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.440]   cheap, small packable floats.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.960]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.840]   We bought two of them or just make friends because a lot of people bring floats and
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.040]   don't want to carry them back.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.800]   So a shout out to Sam and Gabe who travel around the States in a van and bought an
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.480]   amazing pink flamingo and left it for us.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.320]   My wife got a ton of great use out of it, so I really appreciate that.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.560]   If you can, for a place like this, do your overnight flights so that you don't have
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.920]   to spend an extra day on lodging.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.720]   Finally, if you're staying at a place where there's not a lot of stuff walkable
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.400]   or accessible, I always like to stop at the store somewhere, whether it's on your
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.040]   layover or on the cab ride over, even sometimes at the airport, and just pick up
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.200]   a handful of snacks, maybe some drinks, especially if it's a place like this and
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.240]   you want some alcohol.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.320]   I could be really expensive at a resort.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.600]   Pick up a few things.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.920]   I don't expect it to be all the food you'll need, all the drink you'll need,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.080]   et cetera, but it does feel good sometimes to be like, ah, finally I got a $3 beer
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.120]   instead of the $8 resort beer.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.240]   And maybe that's just a small part of me that feels like I want a couple wins on a
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.720]   trip because I know it's really expensive, but that's a tip I have because a lot of
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.360]   times also there aren't some great snacks, you know, room service, you might be able
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.680]   to get French fries as a side dish, but there aren't always just like a bag of
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.400]   chips or some granola or something small like that.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.360]   Okay, that's all the hacks I have from this recent trip, and hopefully this
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.400]   episode gives you some ideas to help you book your next trip.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.600]   But if you have any follow-up questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to shoot
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.080]   me an email, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.480]   I will try to reply to every single one.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.600]   And I hope you got a chance to check out some of the photos and videos from this
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.240]   trip on Instagram or YouTube.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.360]   I'll link to both of those in the show notes.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.680]   Finally, I'm doing an episode with Julia from GeoBreeze Travel, who's an expert in
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.080]   all things credit cards, points, and miles.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.960]   We're recording soon, so if you have any questions you want us to tackle on that
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.600]   topic, please send them my way as soon as you can.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.040]   Thank you so much for joining me this week.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.120]   See you next week.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.640]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.120]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.560]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.680]   Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.800]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.080]   That's it for this week.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   I'll see you next week.
