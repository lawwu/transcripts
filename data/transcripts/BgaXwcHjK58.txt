[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   Let's go over to Genesis chapter 2 and verse 24.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.080]   We're interested here in Genesis 2.24.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.480]   After God has created both Adam and Eve then he gives us a little brief commentary on the
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.520]   husband and wife relationship.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.200]   But even though it's brief, it's jam-packed with all kinds of significance and importance.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.600]   He says in verse 24, "For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.660]   to his wife and they shall become one flesh."
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.200]   So there is three critical elements that are listed here in verse 24.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.660]   There's the element of leaving, there's the element of being joined to, or some translations
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.280]   say cleaving, and then there's the element of becoming one flesh.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.880]   Just for the sake of sound, some have translated this leaving, cleaving, and weaving together.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.600]   But those are the three critical elements.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.840]   And you can see that God ordained from the very beginning that the parent-child relationship
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.640]   is to be a temporary relationship.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.900]   The parent-child relationship is to be a temporary relationship.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.920]   And a little bit later on in the class I'm going to elaborate more on that because I
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.280]   think this is such a critical passage.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.120]   But what should take precedence over the parent-child relationship is the husband and wife relationship.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   That is the most important priority, the husband and wife relationship.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.560]   That's the thing that takes precedence over every other relationship.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:10.620]   So from this verse we learn that in the family the husband and wife relationship takes precedence
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.680]   over every other human relationship.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.340]   So there's our three elements.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.680]   There is the leaving.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   So in that sense, parents should make it easy for their children to leave the home, not
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.480]   make it hard.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   Maybe you've seen families that are like that, parents who hold on to their kids as if they
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.540]   are going to have them for the rest of their lives.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.740]   And they don't do their children a favor by doing that.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.920]   Children are to be reared to leave the home, not stay in the home.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.280]   I think this is vital, and even though all children have a responsibility to honor their
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   parents, the Bible is saying here that as children grow older they should no longer
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.300]   be kept in that home.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.560]   They need to be graduated out of the home because the husband and wife relationship
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.600]   is a much higher priority.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.520]   And then the husband and wife should cleave to one another, or as the New American Standard
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.620]   translates this, be joined to one another.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:32.320]   This is a commitment that exceeds any other human relationship or commitment.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:43.880]   And in fact, later on in Proverbs 2, in verse 17, in Malachi 2, in verse 14, God even refers
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.120]   to the marital relationship as a covenant.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.440]   It's a covenant relationship.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.960]   And the husband and wife relationship is, actually the word for cleave is the word that
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.760]   means to weld together or to be glued together in that sense.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.640]   So the husband and wife relationship should be glued together.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.320]   Back in ancient times, if they would have had the word super glue, I'm sure that would
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.840]   have been used here.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.640]   They need to be super glued together.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.720]   So to pull that relationship apart, you'd have to take skin with it, which would be
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.360]   very painful.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.120]   So they should be glued together.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:47.200]   And God later calls it a covenant, a beret, which shows how sacred that commitment is.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.320]   The basis of the relationship is not some kind of primarily an emotional romantic relationship.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.360]   That's not the basis of the relationship.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.160]   Now that can be the outgrowth of the right kind of commitment.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.280]   But the basis of the relationship is being welded together, is that commitment, that
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.080]   covenant together, that sacred promise.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.960]   That is the thing that bonds that husband and wife together.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:22.000]   There is a sacred vow that they have made before God that they consider to be unbreakable.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   Nothing on the earth should break that vow.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:39.520]   Third, then there is one flesh, and this is more than just involving a physical relationship
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520]   in marriage.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.880]   I think that it obviously includes that, but the idea here is that they comprehensively
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   share their life together.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:00.000]   They comprehensively share their life together.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.320]   As part of becoming one flesh, you know it's really interesting to watch couples as they
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   grow older and they've had a mutually satisfying marital relationship, they start to look like
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.520]   each other.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.040]   They start to talk like each other.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   One of them starts a sentence and the other one finishes a sentence.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:30.000]   They look alike, they talk alike, they eat the same things, they are so used to being
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.760]   together all the time.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.520]   That is a couple that comprehensively shares their lives together.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.480]   Modern feminism today hates that.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.580]   You should never lose your individuality in a relationship.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.360]   The reason why they say that is because some of that is self-protective because when a
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.240]   divorce does occur, it makes it even more painful.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.680]   You, in a sense, always keep yourself as an individual or you keep some distance with
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.360]   that other individual no matter how close you may feel to them.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.480]   If something does happen tragically and that relationship ends, you're not hurt as bad
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.720]   is the implication.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.760]   But that's not God's idea at all.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   Steven?
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.680]   If you're setting yourself up to where you're preparing for a possible divorce, doesn't
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.800]   that heighten the possibility of a divorce?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   Well I would think so.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.240]   I mean, let me repeat a statement.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.400]   If you're setting yourself up for the possibility of divorce, doesn't that heighten the probability
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.600]   of divorce?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.480]   I would think it would.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:48.720]   I mean, rather than planning to live together for an entire lifetime, rather than doing
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.960]   that, you're actually planning contingency plans in case you get out, you know, or you
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.120]   feel that you have to divorce the other individual.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   No, that should be, divorce should only occur, and we'll talk about this a little bit later
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.760]   as well, should only occur for two reasons.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.720]   Number one, unrepentant adultery, that's what Jesus talks about in Matthew chapter 19.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.000]   And I realize that there are popular Bible speakers all over America today that take
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.200]   exception to that and rule that out only because they say that it's referring to only the espousal
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.480]   period of the Jewish law.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.960]   But that is very unconvincing to me because I don't believe it's a true scholarly approach
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   to what's going on in Matthew.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.440]   If that's the case, then Jesus would have been very much more clearer with his words
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.240]   that this is only referring to the espousal period.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.640]   But unrepentant adultery is one of them, and the other one is the abandonment of an unbelieving
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.120]   wife, that's 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:04.920]   So those two exceptions, if an unbelieving wife, husband or wife, partner, abandons you
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.120]   then, can you get a divorce?
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.320]   Should you remain locked perpetually in this relationship even though they are no longer
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.040]   being a husband or wife to you?
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   No.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   No.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.680]   God in his mercy and grace enables you to get out of that and by implication, especially
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.200]   it's clear in 1 Corinthians 7, that you can remarry, you can do that.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.400]   But all these other things that people set up, joint bank accounts, or not joint bank,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:44.560]   separate bank accounts in order in case there's a separation ever in the future so I can protect
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:52.300]   my own resources and there's numerous other steps, prenuptial agreements, which is planning
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.480]   for failure.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.640]   That's what you're planning to do.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:07.800]   So the point however here is that the husband and wife relationship is first priority.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.040]   I believe that if you talk with any of our four children growing up, they will tell you
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   that my priority was first to their mother and then to them.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.960]   And if you were to talk about my wife, they would say her priority was first to me and
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.920]   then to the kids.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.040]   And what that does is, that doesn't mean that I love my children any less than you do, but
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.480]   that enables them to leave the home.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.540]   You rear them to leave, not stay.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.600]   You rear them with this idea.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:52.760]   They're only there temporarily, 18-20 years maybe, 25 years, 30 for some of them, but
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:59.040]   they're only there temporarily and then they go.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.240]   That's what God intended from the very beginning.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.200]   Alright, third.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   The third thing that we need to see here is that the Bible teaches that the family is
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.840]   to be a place where people are shown respect, where people are honored.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.220]   Now if there ever was an important principle here in our day and age, this is such a key
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:33.680]   one because oftentimes the family has so deteriorated to the point where if you wanna be disrespected
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.600]   and dishonored, it happens in the family.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.520]   That's a terrible thing.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.360]   Even for many Christian homes, Christian families.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.480]   Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 16 talks about honor your father and your mother.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.000]   Honor your father and your mother.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.280]   This verse is repeated on several occasions in exact form in the Bible.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.600]   For example, you can see this in Mark chapter 7 and verse 10, Ephesians chapter 6 and verse
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   2, honor your father and your mother.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:14.840]   This is something that God has always intended his children to do, honor their parents.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.880]   And I realize that may not, as a person grows older and becomes an adult on their own, that
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.360]   may not always mean obeying them.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:34.880]   In fact, to obey them, if that would mean to dishonor God, then the most honorable thing
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.920]   that you can do for your parents is honor God first and disobey them.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   But the point is, you must honor your parents, honor your father and your mother.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.120]   Also you find this emphasis on children honoring their parents presented in several different
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.520]   ways in Scripture.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.080]   You can see this in Proverbs chapter 19 verse 26 and Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 20, Proverbs
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.640]   23 and 22, Proverbs 30 and verse 17.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:13.080]   Those are several different passages that focus upon a child's responsibility to honor
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:20.800]   their parents.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.700]   Now there are also plenty of other verses in the Bible that talk about the way that
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.960]   children are to honor and treat their parents.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.700]   They're commanded to honor father and mother, however, there are other verses that make
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.680]   it clear that a family is a place where every family member receives appropriate honor and
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   respect.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:48.320]   For example, we can see this in 1 Peter 3, 7 and Ephesians 5, 33.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.760]   Wives are said in Ephesians 5, 33, are told to respect their husband.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.280]   And the word respect there is the word phobos, which is often translated fear, but it doesn't
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.880]   mean fear as in terror, but to reverence them or highly respect them.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.800]   Wives are told to do that with their husbands.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:10.720]   First Peter 3, 7, husbands are told to live in the understanding way or in a knowledgeable
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   way.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.920]   The word there in the Greek language is gnosis.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:28.200]   Live in a knowledgeable way with your wife and treat her with respect as a weaker vessel
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.680]   and as an heir with you of the gracious gift of life.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.920]   So you are supposed to treat her with respect and honor her and treat her like a, we'll
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:46.820]   talk about this later, that little phrase, a piece of fine China is the idea.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.880]   So husbands are to respect and honor their wives.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.840]   Wives have a responsibility to respect their husbands.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   In 1 Timothy 3 and verse 4, fathers relate to their children in such a way that they
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.920]   elicit respect from their children.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:09.360]   Here is qualification of overseers in the church and there Paul talks about the fact
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:21.920]   that part of the qualification of an overseer is that a child must respect his father.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   Then you have Colossians chapter 3 and verse 21, Ephesians 6, 4.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.520]   One of the ways that parents can exasperate and provoke their children to a wrathful lifestyle
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:42.560]   or to a lifestyle of anger is by treating your children with disrespect.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:49.640]   When you disrespect a child, you bring up that child in a very angry lifestyle.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   Treat them with disrespect.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:16:01.780]   1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 17, honor all men would certainly include family members.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.960]   Paul talks about honoring all men.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:16.200]   1 Timothy chapter 5 and verse 4, piety must begin at home.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.280]   In context here, piety is especially related to the way that a person treats other family
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.480]   members.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 32 exhorts us to be kind and tenderhearted to our enemies.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.480]   Now if that is true of our enemies, how much more should it be of the way that parents
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:43.720]   treat their children and vice versa, the way that children treat their parents.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.620]   So in dealing with the question, you can see at the top of the screen, what is the family?
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:57.160]   The family really is a place where every family member is to be respected and honored.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.920]   Husbands need to respect and honor their wives, wives need to respect and honor their husbands,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.680]   parents need to respect and honor their children, children need to respect and honor their parents.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.840]   That's the way the home should be.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.600]   Boy, but that's not the condition of most homes, is it?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:24.280]   You see a lot of homes that are, there's constant turmoil and strife and anger and bitterness.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:31.640]   Back ten years ago when my wife and I moved to California, the first year we were here
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.680]   we stayed in a condo.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.360]   I'm gonna try desperately never to do that ever again in my life, but we stayed in this
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   condo.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:50.240]   And it was up on a second floor in this compact condo area while we were looking for a permanent
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.680]   place to live and stay.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.840]   And of course, the windows of our condo, when they were open during the summertime and a
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   beautiful breeze would come through, the condos near us, their windows weren't that far away.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.400]   And we could sit there at the dinner table and listen to what was going on in the other
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.840]   homes around us that were relatively close.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.480]   And we were horrified.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.920]   You could hear fights and quarrels and arguments and people getting angry at one another and
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.000]   cursing and swearing and both of us looked at each other and said, "My goodness, if this
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.880]   is the condition of the family in America today, we are in deep trouble."
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.760]   We could hear it on the right side of the condo and on the left side of the condo.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.400]   This was terrible stuff.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.080]   The angry stuff that was going on.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.800]   And I know, I've been in counseling long enough to know that this happens in so-called Christian
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.520]   homes as well.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.480]   People who profess to know Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, those kind of things
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.520]   are going on all the time.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:08.320]   So the family is supposed to be a place where every member is respected, every member is
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.680]   honored.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.280]   That's the way the family is to be.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.600]   When you get someone in the family that for one reason or another, whatever their motivation
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:27.520]   may be, is physically or sexually abusing someone, another member of the family, that
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:37.680]   is the height of dishonor, disrespect.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.300]   God never intended that to be the case.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:50.240]   God never wanted people in the family, never designed the family to be a place where people
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:57.000]   objectified one another and dishonored the Lord Jesus Christ by using and abusing people
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.760]   for your own interests or your own pleasures.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:10.560]   That was never to be the case.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.520]   I'm helping to supervise a counselor right now, and this particular counselor is this
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.960]   woman who is a wonderful gal.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.320]   She graduated from our Master of Arts in Biblical Counseling program there at the college, and
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.580]   she's working in a church, and she's working on her NANC certification right now.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:34.680]   So I'm supervising her through some of her counseling, and she is counseling a woman
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.920]   and her daughter, this little girl who's about 11 years old, and about a year ago, an extended
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:49.020]   family member sexually abused her repeatedly, repeatedly.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.320]   Of course, this little girl, they didn't even know that it happened, and the way they discovered
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.240]   it was the little girl was having pretty serious stomach problems, and they took her to the
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.920]   doctor, and the doctor diagnosed her with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and usually that
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:10.000]   occurs in older people, but it doesn't occur in adults, I mean, in young children, I mean.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.780]   It doesn't occur in young children, especially this little girl who's under the age of 12.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.280]   Why would a little girl have Irritable Bowel Syndrome?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.680]   Well, they began to probe, and they found out that this had happened, and here she had
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.080]   taken all that occurred and stored it on the inside.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.200]   She had stuffed it on the inside, and as a result, she was having bad dreams.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.280]   She wasn't sleeping well at night.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.360]   All these consequences had occurred.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:42.480]   Now, formally, this particular person had been a trusted family member, extended family
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.960]   member, not a part of the immediate family, but obviously, after they found this out,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   this person was no longer a trusted family member, and now is having to face consequences,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:05.400]   legal consequences, as a result of this.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.240]   The point is this.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.700]   These kind of things, both these families, by the way, both claim to be Christians.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.440]   Where the sexual abuse occurred in the extended family member's home, that family claimed
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.440]   to be Christians.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.440]   They went to church together.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:28.600]   Where the home, the actual little girl is, their family is a Christian.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:41.800]   So there is serious breakdown in the Christian home when these kinds of things are happening.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.200]   God never intended that to be the case here.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:55.680]   The home was to be a place where you sought refuge, you found safety, where you were respected,
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.040]   where you were honored.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.640]   It's not a place where somebody who is bigger, stronger than you are, takes advantage of
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   you.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:11.480]   It was never supposed to be the home, and yet, in our sinful depravity, you're going
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.700]   to find yourself, as pastoral counselors, having to deal with this, I'm afraid, more
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.880]   often than you'd like.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   How do you deal with that?
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.800]   How do you handle that kind of thing?
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.960]   Which now brings us to number four.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.480]   Number four is the Bible now teaches us that the family is a classroom in which the most
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:45.400]   important lessons of life are taught and learned.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.600]   Back several years ago, Edith Schaefer, who was the wife of Francis Schaefer, the famous
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:24:00.400]   Christian philosopher, a graduate of Westminster Seminary, she wrote a book on the family,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.800]   and she talked about the family.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.720]   She said, "We ought to think of our family as a relay race in which we, as parents, are
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.920]   passing a baton of God's truth to them."
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.960]   And then she went on to point out the fact that every parent is passing something on
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   to their children.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.800]   In every family, some flag or baton is being passed to the next generation.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.520]   Every child is being taught something in his family, and unfortunately, the flag or the
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:35.760]   baton that is being passed in many cases, if not most families, is not the truth of
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:43.920]   the Word of God, but some distortion of the Word of God or something that's opposite the
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.880]   Word of God or opposed to the Word of God.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:55.080]   Well, that was not God's intention for the family and should not be the case in the homes
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.120]   of those of us who claim to be Christians.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:03.400]   God intended the family to be a classroom or a relay race where truth, not error, is
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.120]   passed on from generation to generation.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:19.720]   So you could say that there is a sense in which the family is analogous to a relay race.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.320]   You can see this reflected in Deuteronomy 4, verses 9 and 10.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.720]   The responsibility to pass on what they've learned to the next generation.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.800]   You can see also the same thing in Deuteronomy 6, verses 6 through 25, how God intended them
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.320]   to pass these things on.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:53.160]   Also Joshua 4, verses 21 through 24, is the same.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.800]   In fact, that probably is a good place to touch down there in the Old Testament.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:07.080]   So grab your Bible just for a moment, let's go over to Joshua 4, verse 21.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   Joshua 4, verse 21, "He said to the sons of Israel, 'When your children ask their fathers
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.640]   in time to come, saying, "What are these stones?"
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.160]   Then you shall inform your children, saying, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.640]   For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until they had crossed,
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   just as the Lord your God had done to the Red Sea, which he dried up before us until
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.720]   we had crossed, that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.360]   mighty, so that you may fear the Lord your God forever.'"
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:50.320]   So, again, their responsibility was to pass from one generation to the next generation
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:57.160]   the truths of what God had done, the great events.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:05.200]   Psalm, verse 78, verses 2 through 7, is another passage that really emphasizes the home being
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   a classroom or a relay race.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:22.600]   Grab your Bible again, let's go over there to Psalm 78, verse 2.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.320]   This is a Psalm of Asaph, he says, "I will open my mouth in a parable, I will utter dark
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.080]   sayings of old, which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:40.400]   We will not conceal them from their children, but tell them to generation to come the praises
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.360]   of the Lord and his strength and his wondrous works that he has done.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.240]   For he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.040]   our fathers that they should teach them to their children, that the generation to come
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.400]   might know even the children yet to be born, that they may arise and tell them to their
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.320]   children that they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God, but
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.920]   to keep his commandments."
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:16.520]   So God takes this passing of the truth of the word from one generation to another generation
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:25.440]   as a critical, critical responsibility.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.760]   Joel chapter 1, verses 2 and 3, God says, "Hear this, O elders, and listen, all inhabitants
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.840]   of the land, tell your sons about it, and tell your sons to tell their sons and their
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.160]   sons the next generation."
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.520]   So that's why we say the family is a classroom.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:59.840]   Or you've got the entire book of Proverbs from chapter 1 all the way to chapter 31.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.520]   Most of that book is a father and mother passing on wisdom to their son.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:14.640]   That's a responsibility, a father and mother passing on their wisdom to their son.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:21.320]   And of course, the concept that parents should be supervising the education of their children
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.100]   must stand out here.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:30.360]   That doesn't mean necessarily that the parents should always do all of the education of their
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.760]   children.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.940]   Even Jesus went to the temple.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.920]   But it does mean that the parents should supervise all of it.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:49.880]   Again, Edith Schaefer states that the family should be an educational control center, and
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.560]   by that she means that the parents should supervise the whole educational process of
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.880]   their kids.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:01.520]   That means they must make sure that the children are taught the right things through family
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:08.160]   Bible study, the family should provide good reading material, make sure that you attend
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:17.200]   a good church, make sure there are good opportunities in Sunday school and youth groups, and these
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:29.440]   are places that don't just entertain children, but they teach children the Word of God.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.920]   This also means you must know that their children are being taught what they're being taught
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.240]   in school.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.980]   Who are your children hanging out with?
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.520]   What television shows are they watching?
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.720]   What movies are they watching?
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.960]   What are their reading material?
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.840]   It doesn't mean that we eliminate all non-Christian reading.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.180]   We can read and interact with the world.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:58.320]   It does mean we ought to know what reading, what they are reading, what they are watching,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.800]   and to discuss those things with them.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:10.200]   Teach them how to think, how to evaluate those things Biblically.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   So what is the family?
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.720]   Well, according to God's Word, the family is a classroom par excellence in which the
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   most important truth of life is to be taught.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.640]   That's the family.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.620]   Let's pick up with number five.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:42.840]   Not only here as we were just talking about, the family is a classroom in which the most
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:48.680]   important truths about life are taught, but the fifth area is that the family, the Bible
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:59.760]   teaches, is really a place of safety, of refuge in the time of storm.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.960]   In fact, there are going to be some stormy times in our lives.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.680]   That's just part of living on this earth.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.880]   Some of you have already had some pretty stormy times in your life, but you're going to also
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:23.240]   have to counsel people who have some fairly stormy times in their lives too.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:42.400]   You can see this in John chapter 16 and verse 33, John chapter 16 and verse 33.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.600]   Jesus says, "These things I have spoken to you so that in me you might have peace, in
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:53.400]   the world you will have tribulation, but take courage, I have overcome the world."
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:00.000]   So Jesus says there is a place where you have to realize that in this world there's going
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.480]   to be hardship and turmoil, especially if you want to live the Christian life consistently.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:15.040]   Psalms chapter 90 and verse 10, "As for the days of our lives, they contain seventy years,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.800]   or if due to strength, eighty years, yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for soon it
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.520]   is gone and we fly away."
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:32.120]   So life is going to be full of labor and life is going to be full of sorrow.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:38.000]   I can just feel myself becoming depressed as I read these passages.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.480]   But the Bible is being very realistic.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:47.920]   Also Genesis chapter 47 verses 8 and 9, "Here Pharaoh said to Jacob, 'How many years have
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.920]   you lived?'
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.280]   So Jacob said to Pharaoh, 'The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.160]   Few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, nor have they obtained the years
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:04.200]   that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning.'"
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:16.400]   So Joseph says that his life has been unpleasant and relatively short, at least compared to
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   his forefathers before him.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:31.920]   Then there's Job chapter 14 and verse 1, "Man," Job says, "who is born of woman is short-lived
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.100]   and full of turmoil."
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.140]   Short-lived and full of turmoil, that's the way life is.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.520]   So life is going to be full of all kinds of storms.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:51.200]   Some of them are going to be expected storms and some of them are going to be unexpected
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.000]   storms.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.020]   And those storms can come in various forms.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:11.360]   For example, family members can experience social rejection or even ridicule because
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:19.800]   of maybe your Christianity or there just may be something that another person just doesn't
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.600]   like about you.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:29.840]   They blame it on the fact that you have incompatible personalities or there's something that somebody
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:36.920]   doesn't like about a member of your family.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:44.900]   I remember several years ago, our oldest daughter, Christa, when she was in about second grade,
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.680]   she had another girl who was a year or two older than her who just decided to make Christa's
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.800]   life miserable.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.160]   And so when Christa would get on the bus in the morning to go to school, there was this
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.280]   girl and she would trip her and she would knock her books out of her arms and she would
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:09.160]   take her homework and write all over it and scribble all over it.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:18.040]   And Christa was always rather tall for her age and she was taller than this girl.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   I knew this girl.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.760]   She lived a couple blocks up the street from us.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.360]   And as a human father, I wanted to say to Christa, "Christa, just turn around and just
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.600]   one time and that'll settle the whole issue, all right?
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.200]   She won't do it anymore."
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.280]   But in our family Bible study together, we had been studying Romans 12 and my wife says,
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.400]   "Why don't we put Romans 12 into practice?
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.000]   Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.300]   Yes, that's what we need to do.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:37:01.120]   And so my wife and Christa decided on a plan that they'd spend the evening making up big
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.220]   chocolate chip cookies.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.800]   My wife has got this to-die-for chocolate chip cookie recipe.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.600]   It's really good.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   Maybe before the end of the semester, you'll get to experience some.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.240]   Yes, I think you need to.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.280]   Just really, really good.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:28.160]   And so they made a big mound of chocolate chip cookies, nice, warm, and hot, and covered
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.720]   them over with aluminum foil.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:35.120]   And Christa and I walked two blocks up the street to Rachel's house.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.560]   And I stood on the sidewalk and Christa walked up to the house and knocked on the door.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.320]   And lo and behold, of all the people in the family, Rachel came to the door.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.400]   She was shocked to see Christa standing there.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.140]   Christa said, "My family and I were making some chocolate chip cookies and thought you
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.000]   and your family would like these here."
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.160]   And she set them in Rachel's hands and Rachel's looking at them like they're a bomb.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.640]   You know, like this.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.880]   And Rachel doesn't say a word.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   And Christa says, "Well, have a good evening."
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:11.360]   And she turns around and walks back to the sidewalk with me and then we walk home.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.000]   So on the way home, I'm saying to Christa, "You know, nothing may ever happen from this,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.400]   but what you've done today, you've really pleased God in this."
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:26.340]   Well, to make a long story short, eventually Rachel became Christa's really good friend.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.900]   And Rachel started coming to church with Christa.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.000]   And as a result of Rachel coming to church, then her whole family started coming to church
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.600]   and her mom and dad became believers.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.200]   And eventually Rachel and her family moved up to Wisconsin.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.880]   And Christa, for years after that, would get letters from Rachel.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.360]   This is long before emails.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:53.540]   Letters from Rachel saying, and she would always sign it, "Your best friend, Rachel."
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.940]   And it all started over chocolate chip cookies.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.520]   Overcoming evil with good.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:08.560]   Well, there are going to be times in which the members of your family are going to face
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.960]   social rejection and ridicule.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.200]   The family should be a place of refuge from that.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   A safety place.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.640]   A place where they're not going to be criticized.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:30.120]   Furthermore, secondly, people are going to place unrealistic expectations on them.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:37.080]   In other words, for children, they may not get the grades that they want in school.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.680]   They may not make it on the basketball team or the football team.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.840]   They may not make it on the cheerleading squad or in the music group that they want to be
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:52.120]   in or in the theatrical thespian group that they want to be in.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:40:02.280]   For husbands, wives, it may come in the form of a loss of a job or some kind of major financial
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:18.880]   setback or through a child's radical disobedience, unexpected, but somehow there may be unrealized
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.720]   expectations that occurred in the family.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:27.360]   When that happens, the family should be a place of comfort.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.880]   A place of safety.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.080]   During those times of storm.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:45.800]   Or there may be unrealistic, unreasonable expectations or demands placed upon people.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   There may be a teacher or a coach that may expect certain things of your child that your
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:05.560]   child is not able to produce or if you are counseling a husband whose boss expects him
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:14.000]   to perform and make sales that he is incapable of really doing, this boss is putting unrealistic
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.360]   expectations or demands on him.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.160]   He wants him to make more money for the company.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.520]   So sometimes that will happen.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.080]   That will cause major storms in a home and a family.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.160]   Or there can be major financial setbacks.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:38.560]   The car breaks down at always the most inopportune time.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.920]   Or somebody gets sick or ill or they have to go to the hospital.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.400]   I can remember when our twin boys were born, this was over 22 years ago, when they were
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:56.000]   first born, they were placed in the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital, NICU.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:05.240]   And each day that they were in the hospital, it cost $1,000 a day per child.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.200]   When I got the hospital bill, which did not include the doctor's bill, that was in addition
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:21.560]   to that, it was more than I paid for my home.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.760]   The neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.360]   And they had only been in there a week.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.620]   It was over $65,000 for a week.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.600]   And that was back in 1987.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.880]   I can't imagine what it would be today.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.720]   That was a huge amount of money.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.120]   I had only paid $60,000 for a house.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.360]   Back then I thought that was a lot of money.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.440]   It sounds really cheap today.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:00.080]   But after one week in neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital, $65,000 they're charging
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:05.480]   me plus the doctor bills.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.300]   Financial setbacks.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.480]   We belonged to this pastor's insurance company in the state of Ohio.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:22.120]   And our case was used as a case that illustrated why they were going into financial bankruptcy.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.500]   Our case was used as an illustration.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.000]   We couldn't help that.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.700]   First when my wife got pregnant, we had no idea that she had twins.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.260]   And then that those twins were going to be born a month premature and have to spend a
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.520]   week in the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.280]   None of that was our choice.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.860]   It was totally in God's hands.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.060]   He knew.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:55.820]   It did bankrupt that care system, which was kind of sad.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.820]   We weren't the only one.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.920]   There were other major claims to that system, too.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.860]   So sometimes there's financial setbacks that occur in homes, in families.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:14.980]   And sometimes there's physical illnesses and disease that come on people.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.720]   Several years ago, my father was diagnosed with leukemia, a particular type of it called
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.600]   myelodiplastic syndrome.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.820]   And that sort of came on him out of nowhere.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:34.900]   And he was a rather healthy guy and went downhill very quickly.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.180]   Just out of nowhere.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.780]   So health problems.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:46.340]   I'm sure if you can probably share many examples or stories that come out of your family or
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.460]   background where those kinds of things have happened.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.860]   That's a major storm that comes into a family.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.380]   Well then there are spiritual challenges, weaknesses, or a time where you believe that
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.900]   God seems so distant, so far away.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.500]   Maybe it happens with you as a parent.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.880]   Maybe it happens with your spouse.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.340]   Maybe it happens with one of your children.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.780]   That's a major storm in life.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:18.580]   How are they going to handle that?
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:24.400]   Well the family should be a place where there's security, there's peace there, there's comfort
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.780]   there.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:34.820]   It's a place of refuge for a person who's facing spiritual challenges, weaknesses.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.620]   Our kids have had that.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:45.380]   One of our kids back about four or five years ago went through a very serious time of questioning
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:51.260]   everything about his walk with God and about Christianity and about the Bible.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:46:00.000]   And my wife and I prayed intently and worked with that kid over and over and over again.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.120]   And there were times where we thought that that kid was not going to come out of it.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.600]   But they eventually did.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   Praise God.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.500]   And if I were to bring that kid in front of you, he'd talk about his love for the Lord.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.040]   That's good.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:21.920]   But I'll tell you, until those things get ironed out, it's a major storm in the family.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.240]   There's challenges, there's weaknesses.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   God is distant.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   In a class this size, you guys that have kids, I dare say that at some particular point there's
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:39.280]   some of you that are going to go through some really hard times spiritually with those kids.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:48.120]   And you have to patiently and lovingly and faithfully work with those kids until they
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:56.920]   see their way through biblically through this dark valley in time.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.440]   Well, then you can see here, see, the family is to be a place of safety and a place of
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.600]   refuge as well.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.080]   A place of safety and refuge.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.280]   You can see this in Proverbs chapter 14 and verse 26, "And the fear of the Lord is strong
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:17.760]   confidence and his children will have refuge."
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.120]   His children will have refuge.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:31.520]   So you can see, at least in the family of God, he is his children's refuge.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:41.200]   Psalm 103 and verse 13, "The responsibility of the father here is to show mercy and compassion
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.400]   to his children."
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:52.640]   Not to be harsh and demanding and order his kids around, but to be merciful and compassionate.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.080]   That doesn't mean he isn't firm.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:01.360]   He can be very firm, but he can be merciful and compassionate in his firmness.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.160]   And then there's Proverbs chapter 31, verses 11 and 12, that indicates that a wife should
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:12.880]   relate to her husband in such a way that the heart of her husband may safely trust in her.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.720]   Should relate to him in such a way that he will never have to seek dishonest spoil.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:24.560]   Proverbs chapter 14 and verse 1 talks about a wise woman is one who builds up her family.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.240]   She doesn't tear it down.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.800]   Proverbs 31, verses 26 through 28, "This woman opens her mouth with wisdom.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.200]   The law of kindness is upon her lips.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.960]   She looks well to the ways of her household.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.720]   Her husband and her children rise up and praise her."
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:48.400]   Ephesians 5:33, "She's the type of woman that esteems and values and admires her husband.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   She highly respects him."
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.280]   And Ephesians 5, verse 33 says, "She reverences him."
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.480]   Psalm 128, verse 3, "She is to be a fruitful vine in her home."
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.800]   And Titus 2, "She is supposed to be busy at home for her family's sake."
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.840]   Genesis 2, verse 18, "She is supposed to be a suitable helper."
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.160]   Is the idea.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:21.440]   So then we also have Proverbs chapter 5, verses 15 through 20 that says, "The husband should
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.400]   rejoice with his wife.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.600]   He should refresh his wife.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.100]   He should use his abilities to bring satisfaction to his wife.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.720]   He should bless his wife.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:39.680]   He should be enthusiastic about his wife, and he should be enthusiastic with his wife."
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.520]   That's his responsibility.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:48.960]   Deuteronomy chapter 24, verse 5, "Responsibility of the husband is here to spend time with
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:59.480]   his wife and to make her his priority, bringing her happiness.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.960]   You show me a wife that is the priority of her husband, and I will show you a very happy
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   woman."
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:17.880]   Victoria just pointed to herself, a very happy woman.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:23.280]   Ephesians chapter 5, verses 28 and 29, "A husband has a responsibility to nourish and
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.080]   cherish his wife."
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:30.120]   That is, meet her needs.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.480]   Build her up in ways that she needs to be built up.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.020]   We're not talking about artificially building up self-esteem.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.560]   That's not what it's talking about.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:44.440]   It's talking about encouraging her in her strengths and helping her in her weaknesses.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:49.560]   That's what it's dealing with.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:54.420]   That's building her up.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.740]   So that's Ephesians 5, 28 and 29.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:06.040]   First Peter 3, 7, "He is to dwell with his wife according to knowledge and treat her
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:14.800]   with respect as a weaker vessel and as an heir with him of the gracious gift of life."
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.440]   First Timothy chapter 5 and verse 8 talks about if any man doesn't provide for a family,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.880]   and I think providing includes more than just financial support, but there also needs to
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:32.960]   be the "emotional support" that needs to be there.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.640]   When they have problems, it's his problem.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.880]   When they have struggles, they know that they can bring it to him.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:47.240]   That's what a family is supposed to do.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:52.560]   And there are a lot of verses in the way that a child should minister to their parents.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.920]   Psalm 128 and verse 3, "Like olive branches," is the way that a child should be to their
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   parents.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:09.960]   An olive branch yielded olives that were good to eat, supplied oil for lamps, very useful
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.920]   little fruit.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.240]   The book of Proverbs makes it clear that in God's kind of family, children are concerned
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.360]   about the well-being of their parents.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   They seek to bring joy to their parents.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.120]   And a wise son, Proverbs 15, 20 says, "makes his father's heart glad."
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:33.920]   A wise son makes his father's heart glad.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.440]   Sometimes I talk with young people about the fact that it's their responsibility.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:44.620]   They are the ones who are responsible for their parents' disposition.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:50.440]   They can make their parents very happy, or they can make their parents very sad.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:55.120]   So there you have at least a partial description of what a family is intended to be.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.000]   It is the antidote to loneliness.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.160]   The family is a place where a husband and wife make their relationship to each other
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:14.320]   a priority issue.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:21.120]   And then the family is also a place where people are shown respect, where people are
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:30.800]   honored, and the family is supposed to be a place of safety, of refuge, during the stormy
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.440]   times of life.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:39.880]   That's what the family ought to be according to scripture.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:46.200]   So that answers our question, what is the family?
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.360]   But let's move on.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:54:00.680]   What type should the church provide when it comes to counseling a family?
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:07.960]   What type of counsel, in other words, should a church provide?
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.000]   Part of the answer to that question is ongoing counsel.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.960]   Through the regular teaching ministries of the church, in order to be an asset to that
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:26.320]   family, the church should be teaching.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.800]   How?
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:35.280]   Well through the preaching services, both formally and informally.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:40.520]   When I was still functioning as a senior pastor, once a year we would have a family enrichment
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   conference.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:45.160]   The family enrichment conference was always in January.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.640]   In January, all of our attention turned to family-oriented issues.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:54.760]   I'd break away from my normal sermon schedule, and we'd spend the entire month of January
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.960]   focusing on family things.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.640]   And it's interesting, over the 15 years I was pastor there, we charted out our growth
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.360]   spurts as a church.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.800]   And there were two times of the year we had growth spurts.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.720]   One was in August and September, when new people were moving into the air, and new people
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.680]   came to our church, starting school again, getting adjusted into school.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.560]   That was our first growth spurt.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.000]   The second growth spurt was always in January, and the only thing that we could attribute
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.280]   it to was the family enrichment conference, where people in the community got excited
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:32.440]   about the fact, and the word began to spread, that this church is really interested in families,
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.400]   and seeing good families, and godly families, and so people started coming.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:45.200]   So preaching, both formally and informally, on family issues is vitally important for
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.320]   the church.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:53.240]   Secondly, there has to be classes, like in Sunday school, or special elective classes
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.520]   that deal with family issues.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:56:00.320]   Here at Grace, we have those all the time, that are going on.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:07.840]   Parenting classes, marital classes, pre-marital classes, are all going on.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:15.520]   Special Bible study groups, for young families, or middle-aged families, or elderly couples,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.480]   are vitally important as well.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.960]   Or special seminars, and marriage conferences.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:25.680]   But you've got to be careful of the national marriage conferences, and weekends, that tend
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.960]   to be heavily psychological.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:35.240]   A lot of these very prominent national marriage conferences that claim to be Christians, be
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:43.240]   very, very cautious of those, as a pastor.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:49.360]   Some of those conferences are really not biblical at all, and you could actually do more harm
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.840]   to the couples in your church, by sending them to those conferences, or having your
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:00.280]   church attend them, and you spend the next five years just repairing the damage that
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.960]   some of those conferences do.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:13.360]   There are weekend retreats, and single church group, or groups of churches, that you can
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.480]   theme on marriage and family issues.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:21.920]   There's also discussion groups, for couples and parents, that you can provide.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:27.800]   Usually every time here at Grace, when we have some kind of emphasis, or stress that's
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:34.920]   laid upon parenting, or marital issues, the area that's picked to present this is usually
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:39.460]   packed out, because people are interested in hearing, what does the Bible have to say
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.800]   about these things?
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:48.280]   Also, I think a church, as pastoral students, you need to understand that a church also
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   needs to make sure that good resources are available.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.080]   Let me explain why.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:58:00.400]   Because a lot of the resources in your average Christian bookstore is really bad, and sometimes
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:05.840]   you have to warn families in your church, stay away from that stuff.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.080]   Sometimes I've told families, as a pastor, I would rather you read the secular literature
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.440]   than read the supposed Christian literature on it.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:18.880]   The reason why is, because the Christian literature purports that it's biblical.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.040]   And so, when they read it in a book, and they think that it's biblical, when in reality
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:28.280]   it's not, it's some kind of psychological notion, then they believe it more, because
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.980]   they think it's biblical.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:35.040]   At least their guard is up when they're reading the secular literature.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.320]   So you need to make good resources available, good books and literatures for loaning and
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.220]   borrowing, encouraging Christians to buy good books, book reviews and church newsletters
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:51.280]   and websites and bulletin boards and evening services, talking about that, making sure
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:58.120]   that you're reading ahead and you understand what they are, and then sharing them with
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.280]   your congregation.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:04.880]   Or making audio recordings and videos available for loan or purchase, or providing good family
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.000]   devotional material.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.800]   And since there is a multitude of very harmful and misleading material in the Christian market,
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.100]   providing this good material is very imperative.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:20.240]   You know the material that you're recommending is good, that it's vitally important that
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:29.960]   you understand it, you've got to make sure it's good before you share it with your congregation.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.800]   And you can provide warnings concerning harmful or misleading material in order to help the
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:38.600]   body of Christ gain some kind of discernment as well.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:52.440]   So there is a sense in which you are the sieve as a pastor in which either good or bad material
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.200]   is going to pass through and get to your flock.
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:01.600]   Now I realize your flock has a lot of voices talking at them on Christian radio, on Christian
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.920]   television, in the area of Christian bookstores and the books that they read.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.960]   So you're not the only voice in their life.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:18.880]   But you should be the primary influential voice other than the scripture itself.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:24.080]   And if that's the case then they should respect your recommendation on what is good and what
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.480]   is right, what's going to be helpful for a good marital relationship, what's going to
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:37.600]   be helpful in my parenting, what's going to encourage me to be more godly in the way that
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:48.040]   I treat my husband or my wife, what is that literature that's going to do that?
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:54.120]   And then there is third, encouraging family development through the way that the church
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.000]   activities are scheduled as well.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.160]   The church should make sure that it plans its programs and activities in such a way
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.040]   that it gives people time to be at home together.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.720]   You know there are some churches that have so many activities, people aren't able to
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.800]   be at home together.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.960]   There's always something.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:19.040]   On Monday night there's church visitation and on Tuesday night there's a board meeting
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.980]   and on Wednesday night there's a Juana and on Thursday night there's Bible clubs and
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:37.320]   on Friday night there is family Bible studies and it ends up the family has no time together.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.360]   That's not good.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:46.680]   We shouldn't schedule so many things that are going on in the church that the family
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:55.160]   doesn't have an opportunity to really be together.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.940]   That shouldn't be happening.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.860]   So we have to be careful there.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.860]   Yes?
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:24.280]   >> I know there's a lot of discussion going on right now with people all the way to extremes
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   like Bodie Baucham and others who would say don't do separate ministries so the family
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   can be together.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   I mean obviously there's a balance to be struck.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   What do you see is the guiding principle that the church should use?
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.960]   >> Wow, that's a really good question.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.960]   Because he's really asking a question about there are some voices out there in Christianity
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.600]   that go to the other extreme and say that the church is really doing the wrong thing
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.760]   when we have anything that takes a person away from the family.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.660]   And that's essentially some of those voices.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:58.600]   Well, I think that there are some of those voices that are saying almost idealizes or
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.720]   they turn the family into an idolatry item.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:13.180]   I mean, it's almost as if they worship the family and that the family is the only institution.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.180]   It's not.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.180]   The church is too.
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.180]   Now, I agree.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:20.200]   We can go to one extreme and overschedule a family where they can't meet together.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:26.040]   But I think we can also go to the other extreme and what usually happens in your average Christian
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:36.840]   home is if there is not good Bible studies going on in the church, good opportunities
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.080]   for service going on in the church, then those families are going to gravitate to a ministry
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.920]   where there is.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.080]   Because they know it helps them in the family, it complements what the family is doing.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:52.880]   So I think that there's going to be a balance between complementary ministries that sometimes
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.400]   take people out of the home without overdoing it.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:05.120]   And at the same time, we give them an opportunity to also be at home together.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:11.680]   Now, we also have another thing going on in our American culture that hinders this.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.200]   And part of me sometimes, at least I understand the argument of families being so busy and
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.480]   out of the home.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:26.440]   And that is, I think we'll talk about this later when it comes to parenting here in the
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.440]   class.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:34.120]   But a lot of parents get their kids involved in every conceivable thing.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:41.640]   Karate, swimming lessons, ice skating, hockey.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.660]   I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:51.280]   So mom and dad in the evenings after school are running all of creation.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:05:01.000]   That's just as harmful as the church overscheduling things for the home and family.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:14.280]   Swimming lessons, football, ballet lessons, gymnastics, on and on.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.040]   This list grows higher and higher and higher and higher and higher and higher.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.560]   And the kids are never home.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.080]   They're always running somewhere.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:37.240]   And that is even, I believe, more detrimental than the church overscheduling long run, long
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.320]   term for the family.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:47.880]   Every parent thinks that their kid's going to be some super duper ballet ballerina or
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:59.920]   super duper soccer player or unbelievably fantastically talented violinist.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.840]   Every parent thinks that and thinks that their kid's going to just really excel.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:09.400]   And it's really devastating when you learn that your kid is just really average.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.040]   All right.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.360]   And there's nothing wrong with average.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.440]   So we don't want to go from one extreme to the other.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:26.100]   We don't want to turn the family into an idol.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.960]   And on the other hand, we don't want to ignore the church either.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.040]   Because long after those kids are out of your family, they'll still have the church.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.880]   And it's important that they have that kind of link for the church.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:47.600]   Well, in addition to this, more than that, it should be encouraged that married couples
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.560]   to date regularly, urge them to have a weekly family night.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:56.800]   Now, one of the reasons why we're saying that is because, remember, it is the husband and
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.080]   wife relationship that takes priority over the kid's relationship.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.440]   Mom and dad need a time away.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.400]   They need a time together.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.240]   All their time should not be centered around the kids.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.800]   Not long after our twins were born, several weeks after we had spent so much time with
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.860]   those kids, making sure that they were healthy and growing normally and everything was okay
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:26.240]   with them, not long after that happened, I eventually said to my wife, "We got to get
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.080]   away and get you away from these kids."
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.680]   You know how hard it was to get her away from those kids?
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:38.440]   Because she had really centered her life around those twins because they were such little
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.920]   babies to begin with, but they began growing pretty rapidly.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.600]   But it was hard to pull her away.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   We've got to get away.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.640]   We've got to go on a retreat or get away for a weekend.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.000]   And then after I finally got her away and we spent the weekend together and came back,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.240]   she said, "Wow, this is the best thing we've ever done."
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:04.060]   But trying to get her away from the kids was really hard.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:11.200]   So then another way you can do this is through the modeling of the church leaders themselves.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.800]   It should be evident that their marriage and family is a priority too.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:20.980]   The pastors, the pastoral staff, the elders of the church, and their wives all should
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:27.120]   model this as a priority, that the family is a priority.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:36.360]   That's the reason why in most of our church policy, most of our ministry or church policy
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:42.360]   was if you're an elder, you can only do one or two things besides being an elder.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.560]   If you get yourself in any more ministries than that, then that's an over-commitment
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.520]   and it's going to pull you out of the family way too often.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.040]   Your ministry as an elder is going to be demanding enough, let alone teaching a Sunday school
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:04.720]   class or helping out in Iwana, there's going to be a whole, you're not going to have a
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.280]   whole lot of time with your family.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:14.560]   Or B, how they interact with each other is also important.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.200]   That is, the way in which staff families, elders' families interact, husbands and wives,
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.960]   the way they talk to each other, the way they refer to one another, whether or not they
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.440]   really respect one another and love one another is really critical for modeling for the rest
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.120]   of the church.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:39.040]   And then churches need to make sure that their relationship is not, well, by giving other
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:49.640]   couples and families opportunities to spend time with their families through hospitality.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:57.560]   They're not so busy that they have no time to spend with their spouse or family.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.360]   And that's why I think for church leadership there needs to be some kind of policy that
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:08.240]   you only can be involved in a very limited number of ministries, otherwise it will really
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:15.840]   affect your family.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:22.280]   Which really brings us to our next point, and that is really restricted service involvement.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:29.240]   So churches really need a policy that sets limits on the number of service opportunities
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.320]   that a member can fulfill to keep marriage and family a priority.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:41.000]   For example, if he's an elder and a Sunday school teacher, then he's not permitted to
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.040]   sing in the choir or to work in the children's ministry, he's not permitted to do that.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   If he's an elder or a Sunday school teacher, then he's not permitted to sing in the choir
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:00.680]   or work in the children's ministry, because no matter how dedicated he may be and how
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   faithful he is to the church, it's going to hurt his family.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.680]   Yes, Jenny?
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:13.840]   Wouldn't it be a policy for the whole church, not necessarily just for elders, but for church
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   members?
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:20.960]   Yeah, it can be a policy for everybody in the church, yeah.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.760]   Now, we had some exceptions, though.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.520]   We had single people who didn't have family responsibilities, and they could be involved
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:36.080]   in far more activities than the people who are married.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.860]   And you know, it's very interesting.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:43.320]   I think that the Apostle Paul speaks to that very issue a little sort of indirectly, but
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.360]   nevertheless, it's there.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:52.400]   Let's go over to 1 Corinthians 7.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:07.800]   And 1 Corinthians 7, he says, verse 32, he says, "But I want you to be free from concern.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.480]   One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.620]   Lord.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.080]   But one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.860]   his wife, and his interests are divided.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.860]   The woman who is unmarried and a virgin is concerned about things of the Lord, that she
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.280]   may be holy both in body and spirit.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.400]   But one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.000]   her husband."
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.140]   And then he says, "This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you,
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:42.740]   but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord."
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:51.320]   So the implication here, Jenny, is that single people don't have the responsibilities that
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.900]   married people do.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.200]   And so they can more wholeheartedly give themselves over to the Lord.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:04.620]   So you don't want to make this such a general policy in the church that single people can't
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:12.280]   get more involved than married people.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.780]   That's really critical, I think.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:21.760]   Then in addition to this, there are also spontaneous efforts of fellow Christians.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:29.600]   For example, you've got the passage like Hebrews chapter 3, verses 12 and 13, it says, "Take
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.040]   care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.400]   away from the living God, but encourage one another day after day as long as it is still
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.460]   called the day, so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:49.600]   Now you notice, it is the church's responsibility to look out among itself to make sure there's
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:56.420]   not someone among them that has a sinful or evil, unbelieving heart.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:01.800]   And then later on in Hebrews 10, 24 and 25, he says, "And let us consider how to stimulate
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.500]   one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:13.600]   of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see a day drawing near."
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.920]   That is the day of Christ's return.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:28.320]   So there are these spontaneous efforts of fellow Christians also that can be an encouragement
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:37.480]   and a help to families, to marriages.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.820]   We're dealing with how the church can be an asset with a family.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.900]   That's what we're dealing with.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:49.720]   What type of ministry should that church provide family members?
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.880]   So so far we've said ongoing counsel.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:06.260]   B, there's also special care counseling through structured counseling.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:19.020]   Sometimes this can be in the form of preventative or preparatory nature, special care counseling.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.720]   We can see examples of that.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.620]   The Apostle Paul there with the Ephesian elders in Acts 20, verses 28 through 31, especially
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:32.980]   in verse 31 where the Apostle Paul says, "How I did not cease to admonish you for three
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:39.100]   years night and day with tears," he says.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:45.500]   So he was admonishing them to remain faithful to the word.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:50.660]   And then sometimes your counseling takes on remedial or corrective nature.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:55.220]   This is when a family has gotten into trouble, when a marriage is beginning to fall apart,
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:03.420]   or when a home is breaking down and there's broken relationships and maybe one family
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:11.500]   member has been abusive to other people within the family, physically or sexually.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:17.020]   And then Escalation 6.1 says we're supposed to be called alongside in a restorative type
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:23.500]   of way to help a brother who has fallen into any kind of trespass, or actually the word
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:32.980]   there in the Greek is pro lombano, is overtaken in any kind of a, or I think the English sometimes
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:36.220]   translates it caught in any trespass.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.940]   But the idea is that they've been overtaken in it.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:47.700]   So we're supposed to come along and restore them, fit them back so that they are functioning
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:52.820]   better as a marriage and as a home and as a family.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.600]   That's our responsibility.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:10.100]   And it's up to you as a pastor who desires to have a church with godly families that
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.540]   are interested in glorifying the Lord, it's up to you to make sure that these kinds of
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:19.340]   ministries are going on to supplement that family, especially if the family begins to
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:20.340]   get into trouble.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.580]   What are you going to do?
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.040]   Most pastors choose to punt.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:34.780]   They'll send their hurting families out to some neighborhood psychologist or psychiatrist,
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:40.660]   and even though that psychologist or psychiatrist may mean well, and even though that psychologist
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:45.700]   or psychiatrist may even call themselves a Christian, does not mean that they are going
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.180]   to deal with their problems biblically.
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:53.820]   In fact, given their training and background, nine chances out of ten, they're not going
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:55.740]   to deal with it biblically.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:18:00.340]   In fact, they'll do more harm than good to the marriage and do more harm than good to
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:00.940]   the family.
