[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.400]   Imagine a high school senior who is trying to decide whether to go to college.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.360]   He walks into the office of his school's counselor and asks for help in making up his mind.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:51.040]   The counselor knows that this student's grades are B's and C's, and that his motivation and industriousness are fine, but nothing special.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.440]   He's considering some college majors that sound interesting to him, but he does not have a passion for any of them.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.240]   In fact, as the counselor talks to the student, she discovers that what he really enjoys is working with his hands.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.840]   The idea of sitting in an office does not appeal to him, but his parents have their hearts set on their son's getting a college degree,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.240]   and most of his friends will be going to college next fall.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.080]   What information should the counselor give to the student to help him decide?
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.440]   We know what she is likely to say.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.880]   A survey of high school students revealed that more than 90% of them were encouraged by their high school counselors to go to college.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.760]   But what does this student really need to know?
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.000]   Above all, he needs to know whether he can expect to do well in college if he puts in a serious good faith effort.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.200]   And to know that, the student needs to understand the relationship between his level of intellectual ability and the demands of college courses in the majors he wants to declare.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.560]   The counselor is not likely to give that information to him.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.960]   She is unlikely even to possess it.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:07.840]   Hardly any high school counselor has such information, because publicizing blunt facts about the relationship of intelligence to success in college has been out of bounds for decades.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.280]   In an age when everyone from parents to presidents urges every child to go to college, a simple truth is almost universally ignored.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.240]   Only a small minority of high school graduates have the intelligence to succeed in college.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:39.840]   The refusal to confront the relationship between intelligence and success in college has produced a cascade of harms to many students who try to go to college, to those who do not, to the system of higher education, and to the nation as a whole.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.160]   Academic Ability and Academic Success.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   For 40 years, American leaders have been unwilling to discuss the underlying differences in academic ability that children bring to the classroom.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   Over the same period, federal policy, backed by billions of taxpayer dollars in loans and grants, has aggressively encouraged more and more students to try to obtain a college education.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:18.960]   As a result, about half of all high school graduates now enroll in four-year colleges, despite the ample evidence that just a small minority of American students—about 10 to 15 percent—have the academic ability to do well in college.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.160]   At first, that proposition seems false on its face.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.080]   After all, more than a quarter of American adults have successfully obtained a bachelor's degree—hereafter, B.A.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.320]   But the point is not that only a small minority of young people can survive for four years and get a degree in today's colleges.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.000]   Rather, that only a small minority of them can do well.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.160]   For everyone else, there ought to be better options than spending four years scraping by.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.400]   At best.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.900]   To make that case, it helps to put aside that inflammatory word "intelligence" and substitute
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.200]   the term "academic ability."
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.080]   It's mostly a matter of changing labels, not meaning.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.960]   Academic ability refers primarily to two of Howard Gardner's famous multiple intelligences—linguistic
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.680]   intelligence and logical mathematical intelligence.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.800]   These two, along with some aspects of what Gardner calls "spatial intelligence," are
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.760]   what IQ tests measure as part of their larger effort to determine "G," the general mental
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.100]   factor.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.400]   Academic ability is also well measured by the SAT, ACT, and other tests that bill themselves
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.120]   as indicators of academic preparation for college.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.280]   But labels can make a difference.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   Using "academic ability" instead of "intelligence" emphasizes that the argument does not depend
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.920]   on the heritability of cognitive ability, the relationship of test scores to socioeconomic
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.960]   status, the malleability of mental capacity in toddlers, or the reality of "G."
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.760]   Instead I work from the simple and easily demonstrable proposition that what you see
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   in the academic ability of high school seniors is what you get.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.920]   Things can still change at that age, and so can motivation.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   Such changes can have dramatic effects on academic performance.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   But the underlying level of academic ability is fixed long before the end of high school.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.240]   So how much academic ability is required to do well in college?
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.760]   We can begin by looking at what it takes to graduate from college.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.440]   In 1972, the standard textbook for the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale concluded that "a
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.680]   good working rule of thumb for the mean IQ of college graduates was about 115, which
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   cuts off the 84th percentile."
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.160]   This was just an estimate based on the author's clinical experience and consistent with the
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.200]   research literature on college students of the 1950s and 1960s.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.520]   But we have two excellent sources for checking that estimate more precisely, members of the
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:11.720]   1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, NLSY, who were given a psychometrically
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.440]   sound measure of academic ability, the Armed Forces Qualification Test, AFQT, at baseline.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.240]   I have limited the samples to those who took the test in their high school years so that
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.200]   the measure of academic ability is uncontaminated by any college-level instruction, or lack
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   of it.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.280]   I also limit the sample to non-Latino whites, hereafter just whites, to sidestep complex
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.000]   issues about differential treatment of whites in minorities in colleges, issues that are
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.240]   extraneous to my argument.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.480]   The members of the 1979 cohort who qualified for the analysis were in their college years
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.960]   from 1980 to 1986.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.520]   Expressed in the IQ metric, the white youths who eventually got a bachelor's degree during
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.720]   that era had mean AFQT scores of 115.0.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.400]   The members of the 1997 cohort were in their college years from 1998 to 2006, and the mean
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:22.360]   AFQT of the white youths who had gotten a BA as of 2006 was 114.1.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:29.600]   That "good working rule of thumb" offered in 1972 still seems to be very good indeed.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.280]   About half of the white college graduates had scores lower than 115.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.360]   In the 1997 cohort of the NLSY, for example, a quarter of the BAs were acquired by white
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:49.480]   youths with AFQT scores under 107, and 10% went to youths with scores under 100.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.080]   So if getting a degree constitutes our definition of "doing well," then the proportion of
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.840]   whites who can "do well" is much larger than 10-15%.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   On the other hand, anyone who has taught a college class (unless he has spent his career
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.760]   at a highly selective school) knows that large numbers of students who manage to get a BA
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.400]   do not do well in the classroom.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   They get by, showing in their classroom participation that they do not understand much of the material
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.440]   – writing barely literate term papers and turning in essays on the final exam that aren't
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.600]   quite bad enough to flunk.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.640]   These students aren't necessarily "lazy," they just aren't very good at the kinds
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.600]   of things that constitute competence in college courses.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   Just getting a BA is far too loose a standard for "doing well."
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:46.900]   A better definition may be drawn from Jennifer Cobran's 2007 analysis of college readiness.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.900]   In line with others' definitions, Cobran, a researcher for the College Board, defined
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.840]   college readiness as a 65% chance of getting a 2.7 grade point average in the freshman
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.400]   year of college.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:07.720]   She used a sample of 165,781 freshmen of all ethnicities with SAT scores and freshman grade
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.700]   point averages who had attended 41 different colleges, ranging from unselective state universities
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.780]   to elite schools.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:22.480]   The question she put to her data was this – what is the minimum SAT score, the benchmark
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.380]   score, that is statistically associated with that 65% probability of at least a 2.7 grade
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.380]   point average?
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:37.260]   It doesn't sound like a demanding standard – a B-minus average in an age of grade inflation
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.220]   with no limitations on the courses that qualify.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:46.300]   But demanding or not, the benchmark score for reaching that standard was 1180 for the
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   combined SAT Verbal and SAT Math.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.740]   Was the benchmark inflated by tougher grading in the most selective colleges?
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.740]   No.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:01.060]   The difference between the benchmarks of the unselective institutions and highly selective
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.580]   ones was only 23 points.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.820]   Was it inflated because many small private colleges were part of the sample?
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.820]   No.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.480]   The benchmark was lower for small private colleges than for large state universities.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:21.300]   How many of America's 18-year-olds could get a combined SAT score of 1180 or higher
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.740]   if everybody took the SAT?
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.100]   In my 2008 book Real Education, I used three independent methods of calculating the answer
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.000]   to that question – estimating the distribution of scores of the 18-year-olds who do not take
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.620]   the SAT, using the College Board's norm studies that employed nationally representative
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:45.460]   samples and using the work of Meredith Fry and Douglas Detterman, who compared SAT scores
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.900]   and AFQT scores in the 1979 cohort of the NLSY.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.260]   The three methods each produced a narrow range of plausible answers.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.540]   Somewhere between 9 and 12 percent of the 18-year-old American population could get
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:07.860]   a score of 1180 or higher, with a realistic best guess of about 10 percent.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:14.820]   There is no inconsistency between Cobren's results and a 115 mean IQ among white college
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.100]   graduates.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.220]   The students who make salient points in classroom discussions, who write well-researched term
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.620]   papers and whose final exams demonstrate that they understood the material, are usually
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.740]   well into the upper half of the distribution of academic ability among those who go to
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.940]   college.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.460]   In other words, they are somewhere in the top 15 percent of the population, and usually
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.540]   in the top 10 percent.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.420]   This conclusion is easy to accept when it comes to majors in mathematics and the hard
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.660]   sciences.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.260]   No one can do well in those majors unless he can handle the math, and handling the math
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.220]   usually means being able to pass courses in advanced calculus and statistics.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.700]   Most people are willing to concede from their own experience with mathematics that only
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.980]   a small percentage of people are competent in advanced math, and 10 percent does not
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.420]   sound out of line.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.220]   Yet courses in the humanities and non-quantitative social science would appear to have no equivalently
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.040]   obvious intellectual barrier to entry.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.500]   All you have to be able to do is read and comprehend.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.140]   But in college, what you have to read is often not easy.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:28.860]   In Real Education, I used quotations drawn from page 400 (a randomizing choice) of several
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.140]   college textbooks to remind my readers what college-level reading is like.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:41.260]   Here is one from page 400 of The Western Heritage (1983) by Donald Kagan, Stephen Osment, and
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.100]   Frank Turner.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.820]   The Protestant Reformation could not have occurred without the monumental crises of
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:54.540]   the medieval church during the Exile in Avignon, the Great Schism, the Conciliar Period, and
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.280]   the Renaissance Papacy.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.460]   For increasing numbers of people, the medieval church had ceased also to provide a viable
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.100]   religious piety.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.620]   There was a crisis in the traditional teaching and spiritual practice of the church among
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.580]   its many intellectuals and laity.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.380]   Between the secular pretensions of the papacy and the dry teaching of scholastic theologians,
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.940]   laity and clerics alike began to seek a more heartfelt, idealistic, and, often in the eyes
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.520]   of the pope, increasingly heretical religious piety.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.700]   If you think that more than 10 percent of American 18-year-olds could follow the thread
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:36.220]   of that paragraph, even if you explained what Reformation, Great Schism, and Renaissance
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.080]   meant, you should go to the National Center for Education Statistics website.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.860]   It posts sample questions from the 12th grade reading tests of the National Assessment of
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.940]   Educational Progress along with the percentages of students getting them right.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.080]   The numbers are sobering, as are the overall results.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.100]   Just 5 percent of 12th graders reached the "advanced" level on the National Assessment's
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:07.940]   reading test, and "advanced" is what that passage from the Western Heritage requires.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.100]   Succeeding in social science and humanities courses taught at a genuine college level
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.180]   demands a lot more than just basic literacy and motivation.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.420]   Add in the rigors of courses in the hard sciences, and that estimate of 10 to 15 percent who
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:30.100]   can do well in college seems not just plausible, but generous.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:36.260]   The Costs of Failure If trying for a college degree were cost-free,
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.220]   and if students were unaffected by failure, these numbers would still justify some version
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.060]   of an "everybody should go to college" position.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.700]   If people with average academic ability can sometimes get a BA, why not encourage everyone
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.140]   to attempt it?
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:58.980]   But trying for a BA exacts high costs in both time and money, often burdening students with
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.900]   large loans as they start out in life.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.780]   And teenagers bleed if they are pricked.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.540]   Encouraging young people who can succeed if they try hard to strive for college is one
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.420]   thing, but setting young people up for failure is another.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.660]   The advocates of college, for everyone, seldom mention those who try and fail.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:23.380]   But in fact, the college dropout rate is extremely high.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:29.420]   In a longitudinal study sponsored by the Department of Education, 42% of those who entered college
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.280]   in 1995 had not obtained a degree within 6 years.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:41.160]   That is almost exactly the same as the 41% of white youths in the 1979 NLSY cohort who
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.500]   dropped out of 4-year colleges and never got a BA.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:53.420]   For whites in the 1997 cohort who were at least 24 years old in the 2006 survey, 39%
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.580]   of those who had entered a 4-year college had not yet obtained a degree.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:08.700]   The mean AFQT scores of the dropouts in the 1979 and 1997 cohorts were 104 and 103, respectively,
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.880]   compared to the 115 and 114 of those who graduated.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.780]   Lower academic ability in high school was strongly associated with increased likelihood
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.420]   of failure.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.740]   A statistical analysis lets us be more precise.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.980]   The figure on the following page shows the probability that a person with a given AFQT
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.060]   score who enrolled in a 4-year college dropped out before getting a degree.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.660]   The results from the two cohorts, born 20 years apart, are remarkably similar.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.220]   They will become virtually identical as those in the 1997 cohort who were still enrolled
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:49.740]   in college as of 2006 either give up (disproportionately those at the low end of ability) or get their
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.700]   degrees (disproportionately those at the high end of academic ability).
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.740]   Note that the analysis is based only on those who had the motivation to enter a 4-year college
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.300]   in the first place.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.900]   If the graph were based on everybody, the probability of failing to get a degree would
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.280]   be far higher for those at the lower levels of academic ability.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.940]   But even when restricted to the self-selected group who try for college, the crossover point
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:22.100]   at which a student had a 50/50 chance of getting a BA was an AFQT score of about 105 in both
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.780]   cohorts.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.220]   Now put the information in that graph together with these facts about who tries to go to
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.660]   college.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.500]   About 17 out of every 20 white high school seniors of the 90th percentile of academic
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.060]   ability enter a 4-year college hoping to get a BA.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.020]   20% of them can be expected to fail.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.700]   About 2 out of 3 white high school seniors at the 75th percentile of academic ability
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.740]   enter a 4-year college hoping to get a BA.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.180]   40% of them can be expected to fail.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.900]   About half of white high school seniors at the 60th percentile of academic ability enter
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.620]   a 4-year college hoping to get a BA.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.900]   52% of them can be expected to fail.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.260]   About 2 out of 5 white high school seniors at the 50th percentile of academic ability
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   enter a 4-year college hoping to get a BA.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.860]   60% of them can be expected to fail.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.500]   The reality behind these numbers is even more depressing.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   Those among the academically talented who do not get a degree are likely to be voluntary
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.980]   "failures" – students who easily could have gotten the BA but behaved in ways that
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.380]   prevented them from doing so – spending too much time partying, or running the student
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.740]   newspaper, or as in the case of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, deciding they wanted to do
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.380]   something else.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.060]   The lower we go down the ladder of academic ability, the higher the probability that the
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.820]   failure was genuine – an inability to cope with college-level material, combined with
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.700]   the discouragement and loss of self-confidence that accompany any endeavor in which we try
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.780]   hard and just can't do it.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.060]   Counselor's Conundrum Let us return to the guidance counselor as
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.420]   she considers what to tell the uncertain high school senior.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.100]   Leafing through his folder, she finds a record of his score on an IQ test the school administered
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.980]   when he was in 8th grade.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.780]   It is 105, a number consistent with his performance in high school.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.400]   So now she has something specific she can tell him.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:21.100]   For the last 30 years, white students with AFQT scores of 105 (roughly equivalent to
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:27.500]   IQs of 105) who have gone to college have had only a 50/50 chance of getting a BA.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.340]   If the student takes an undemanding major, he can improve his odds.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.740]   And if he works really hard – much harder than most students do – he can improve his
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.980]   odds.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.200]   But if he is interested in a difficult major, the odds go down.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.980]   Taking any major that requires serious mathematics drives the odds close to zero.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:52.500]   Another reality is that, on average, dropouts spend about two years in college, incurring
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.940]   the high costs that involves before they leave.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.140]   The fact that they dropped out probably meant that they were not getting much out of their
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.340]   courses and had not enjoyed their classroom experiences.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.740]   The high school student should know these things too before he decides to take the plunge.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.020]   But the counselor must also talk to the student about two other realities.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:18.780]   First, having a BA will probably increase the student's future income substantially.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:25.700]   Judging from the 1979 NLSY cohort, someone with this student's academic ability will,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:33.100]   in his early 40s, be making about $29,000 more per year if he gets a BA than if he doesn't.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.940]   That is an extremely large incentive to get the degree.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:43.700]   Second, less concretely but just as real, the BA has become a social gatekeeper.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:49.020]   Having a BA does not confer much prestige anymore unless it comes from an elite school.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:55.380]   But not having a BA is a badge of second-class social status, unless one is in the Bill Gates/Steve
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.700]   Jobs category.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.340]   To be just a high school graduate sounds very bad these days, and it doesn't sound much
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.820]   better to say you have an associate's degree from a community college.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.700]   After the counselor has given all this information to the student, the young man says to her,
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.220]   "What do you think I should do?"
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.340]   It is a daunting question.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:23.540]   What is, in fact, in his best long-term interests, both for maximizing his chances of financial
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.620]   success and for finding him a satisfying vocation?
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.980]   The counselor has no good answer, because the options available to her are inadequate.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.260]   The student should certainly get more education after high school.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.660]   There are courses taught on college campuses that could benefit him.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.260]   But four years?
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.780]   A BA?
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.980]   Why should he have to commit to the BA to get what he needs?
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.380]   The purpose of college has evolved, but the measure of success in college, the bachelor's
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.620]   degree, has not.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.900]   Therein lies the source of the counselor's conundrum.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.460]   Enormous economic and social value comes from a nearly meaningless piece of paper.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.260]   It is nearly meaningless because, except for a handful of majors in the hard sciences,
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.860]   a BA tells an employer next to nothing about what the degree holder has learned.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.380]   The requirements for majors are usually so loose, and the availability of soft courses
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.860]   so great, that an employer has to scrutinize the transcript course by course to have any
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.900]   idea of what an applicant knows.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:30.060]   Nor does the BA signify rigorous training in argumentation, decision-making, and writing.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.860]   Some newly minted graduates have taken courses that inculcated those abilities.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.340]   Many have not.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.260]   Nor does the BA signify that the graduate has obtained a liberal education.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.940]   The core curricula that once ensured a solid grounding in history, philosophy, the natural
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.580]   sciences, great literature, and the arts have all but disappeared from American colleges.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:55.260]   And yet, the BA has become a prerequisite for getting an interview in vast stretches
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.000]   of the job market.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.500]   Not because a BA is necessary for the entry-level tasks that employers need performed, but because
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.040]   it represents a course screen for a certain degree of intelligence and a certain degree
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.780]   of perseverance.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.740]   We are so accustomed to this use of the BA, and let's face it, it fits so comfortably
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.780]   with the interests of upper-middle class parents with smart children, that we need to find
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.060]   ways to step back and see how bizarre the situation has become.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.540]   Try this thought experiment, which I propose in Real Education.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.260]   You have been made a member of a task force to design America's post-secondary education
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.100]   system from scratch.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.220]   One of your colleagues submits this proposal.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.660]   "First, we will set up a single goal to represent educational success, which will
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.500]   take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.220]   We will attach a large economic reward to it that usually has nothing to do with what
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.460]   has been learned.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.380]   We will urge large numbers of people who do not possess adequate ability to try to achieve
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.500]   the goal, wait until they have spent a lot of time and money, and then deny it to them.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.440]   We will stigmatize everyone who doesn't meet the goal.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.220]   We will call the goal a BA."
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.300]   You would conclude that your colleague was cruel, not to say insane, but that's the
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.060]   system we have.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.220]   An alternative.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.380]   Many young people who cannot do well in the four-year residential college program leading
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:25.940]   to a BA could do well in other educational configurations, if such alternatives were
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.500]   available, and if society accorded them more legitimacy.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.020]   In some cases, better configurations could be achieved simply by shortening the amount
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.220]   of time spent in school.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.000]   Get rid of the four-year requirement, and many young people who are eager for careers
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.660]   in business, say, would do just fine in the eight or ten courses in marketing, management,
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.900]   and finance that they are highly motivated to take.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.120]   Other alternatives might require adaptation to different learning styles.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.260]   If the traditional BA is the goal, there is no getting around severe demands on verbal
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.420]   ability in the humanities and mathematical ability in the sciences.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:05.260]   But the skills necessary for many vocations that now require the BA for a job interview
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.540]   could be taught better than they are in the traditional college course.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:15.180]   If these skills were taught in a more hands-on, apprentice-like manner, they, and the vocations
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:20.060]   opened by them, would become more accessible to people whose strengths are not linguistic
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.720]   and logical mathematical.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.980]   Some improvements might just be a matter of eliminating the residential requirement.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.900]   Going to live at that idyllic four-year college is just not feasible for many young people.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.460]   They need alternatives that don't require a residence and a full-time commitment.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.260]   Community colleges and distance learning through the internet provide an abundance of those
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.540]   alternatives.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.740]   But they are always going to be second best as long as the BA is the goal.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.880]   The solution, then, is not a better BA, but no BA.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.060]   In lieu of degrees, substitute certifications.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.180]   The CPA exam for accountants is the model for occupations that lend themselves to paper
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.620]   and pencil tests.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:06.780]   Journeyman examinations in the crafts are the model for occupations in which work samples
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.220]   are important.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.640]   The goal is simple.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.300]   Give young people a way to show prospective employers what they know and what they can
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.260]   do, not where they studied and for how long.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.360]   Certifications will work just as well for graduate and professional schools seeking
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.820]   to evaluate prospective students.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.020]   What do law schools, medical schools, and graduate schools in the arts and sciences
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.820]   really want their applicants to bring to the graduate experience?
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:36.060]   Presumably a liberal education, along with credentials specific to the discipline.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.460]   So let the schools define what that means in terms of content areas and specify accordingly
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.780]   the evidence they want to see.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.220]   There are no technical obstacles to such reforms.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.340]   Certification tests already exist for dozens of occupations, and the model for employing
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.300]   them is easy to follow.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.940]   What is needed is a change in mindset—recognition by employers, parents, students, and educators
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.940]   that it is wrong and punishing to use the BA as the prerequisite for a job interview.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.260]   Employers looking for productive employees, and graduate schools looking for well-prepared
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:14.840]   students, need information, and the piece of paper called a BA does not provide it.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.660]   Nothing in this proposal forces students to treat college as vocational training or as
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.040]   a way station to graduate school.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.660]   On the contrary, I can imagine the development of a certification demonstrating that someone
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.940]   has acquired a liberal education—a real certification of what the BA now falsely purports
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.260]   to show.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.460]   It is even possible that the popularity of rigorous liberal education will grow, because
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.580]   many types of employers will want real evidence of a real liberal education.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.900]   Nothing in this proposal conflicts with the intangible benefits of the college experience.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.500]   The maturation, development of skills and critical thinking, and the broadening of horizons
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.900]   that are virtues of that experience today do not depend on forcing everyone into the
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.420]   BA mold.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:00.500]   On the contrary, insofar as students are taking courses that they want and are motivated to
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.540]   take, the chances that they will benefit from their college experiences are increased.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.580]   Nothing in this proposal suggests that we should follow the German model, sorting students
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.380]   into vocational and academic bins at an early age and limiting their educational opportunities.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.880]   On the contrary, the reason to substitute certifications for the BA is not to reduce
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.100]   options for some, but to create new options for everyone.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:28.140]   It is worth adding, however, that to avoid the German model, the government must stay
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.380]   out of the process.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.780]   Certifications must evolve based on the evidence of learning that employers and graduate schools
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.020]   want, not the evidence that bureaucrats think they should want.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.100]   If certifications come to replace the BA, colleges around the country will still be
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.820]   filled with students—even more students than today.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.380]   The difference will be that far more of them will be there to learn, not to wait out four
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.620]   years.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.200]   And one other difference.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.420]   Today we live in a world with first-class and second-class paths from adolescence to
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.960]   adulthood.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.980]   College is first-class, and everything else is second-class.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:10.100]   When the BA is no longer the universal goal of post-secondary education, it will be easier
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.020]   for everyone to recognize that all students who seek more education after high school
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.900]   are engaged in the same activity—discovering what they love to do, and learning how to
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.380]   do it well.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:26.820]   For some, the things they love to do will involve the stuff of a classic liberal education.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.420]   Others will pursue practical tools for making a living.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.580]   But the quest is the same for all.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:41.020]   Ridding ourselves of the BA is a good way to help everyone recognize that common bond.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:47.940]   The article I have just read you is called "Intelligence in College," written by
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:54.420]   Charles Murray, published in 2009 in National Affairs Magazine.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:01.820]   The bad news is, there hasn't been a ton of progress since 2009 in the direction outlined
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.580]   and proposed by Murray.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:10.340]   The good news is, there has come a lot of progress in the last couple of years, and
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:17.100]   I'm optimistic that the next decade will mark some of those changes called for so long
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.300]   ago by Murray.
