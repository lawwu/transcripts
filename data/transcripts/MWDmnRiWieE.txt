[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.740]   - Eli writes in to ask this,
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.300]   Dear Pastor John, in a message titled,
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.420]   For Men, Augustine's Sin and Sovereign Joy.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.900]   You said this, quote,
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.320]   "The Pleasures of God," your book,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.620]   "is not a book about sex at all,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.060]   "except that everything about God is about sex."
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.980]   End quote.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.100]   Can you provide more clarity on what you meant
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.540]   by everything about God is about sex?
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.340]   What do you mean, Pastor John?
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.300]   - Well, the first thing to clarify
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.980]   is when I say everything about God is about sex,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.380]   that's not a unique statement about sex.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.660]   I would say the same thing about everything.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.060]   Everything about God is about everything,
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.060]   meaning everything about God relates to everything.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.180]   Everything about God shapes the way we think
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.640]   about everything and the way we handle everything
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.820]   and the way we feel about everything
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.740]   and the way we do everything, or it should.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.200]   In other words, nothing in the world,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   absolutely nothing has existence apart from God.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.140]   And therefore, nothing in the world
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.180]   has meaning apart from God.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.660]   God designed everything and created everything
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.460]   and holds everything in being,
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.940]   governs everything for His purposes,
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.380]   and His purposes always include supremely
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.640]   the display of the fullness of His glory,
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.000]   that is, everything about God.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.060]   Therefore, sex exists because God designed it,
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.860]   God created it, God sustains it, God governs it,
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.260]   and it gets its meaning from God,
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.060]   and that meaning is the display of the fullness
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.380]   of the glory of God, and the fullness of the glory of God
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.260]   includes all that God is, or as I said,
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.860]   everything about God.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.860]   Therefore, sex exists to display God in His fullness.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.700]   So let me put a text under all those claims,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.220]   1 Timothy 4, 1 to 5.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180]   Now, the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times,
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.540]   some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.860]   to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.440]   What do those demons teach?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.100]   Through the insincerity of liars
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.180]   whose consciences are seared, who do this,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.180]   forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.420]   that God created to be received with thanksgiving
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   by those who believe and know the truth
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.580]   for everything created by God is good
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.100]   and nothing is to be rejected
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   if it is received with thanksgiving
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.220]   for it is made holy by the word of God in prayer.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220]   The point of that passage is to warn us against those
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.180]   who think that marriage and its sexual relationship
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.180]   are not a proper place for the expression of faith in God
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.460]   and thanks to God based on truth about God.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.940]   That's all from that text.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.700]   But Paul says that marriage and its sexual relation
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   and food are designed precisely for those who believe
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.580]   and who know the truth and who give thanks to God
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.420]   whose glory is displayed precisely in those things.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.620]   Or we could put it this way, whatever you do,
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.860]   whether you eat or drink or have sex,
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.300]   do all to the glory of God.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   That is, recognize the fullness of the glories of God
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.740]   manifest in the design and creation
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.900]   and sustaining and governing of sexual intimacy
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.580]   and turn all of it into a reflection
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.380]   of the fullness of God's glory.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.260]   Now, if a person hears me say,
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.140]   everything about God is about sex,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.820]   he might wonder, well, how is the wrath of God about sex?
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.980]   Or he might pick another one.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.980]   So let's just take that one.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.980]   The answer is that in a world where every human being
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.300]   deserves wrath, this world,
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.000]   and any human being gets the pleasure of sex,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.860]   we should be astonished at the massive contrast
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.260]   between the mercies of God and the wrath of God
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.180]   in that very moment of exquisite pleasure.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.860]   Every person who enjoys the pleasures of sex
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.460]   should be astonished precisely because of that pleasure
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.460]   that they are not at that moment in hell instead,
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.120]   because that's where we all deserve to be
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.500]   at any given moment, and only mercy keeps us out
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.300]   and some of those mercies are poured out
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.940]   precisely through food and sex
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.100]   on the very people who don't even think the giver exists.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.900]   And so, yeah, sex is very much about wrath.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.860]   So I would affirm, reaffirm what I said,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.860]   namely that everything about God is about sex
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.740]   because everything about God is about everything.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.340]   - It doesn't get more comprehensive than that.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.620]   Thank you, Pastor John, and where else will you get
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.420]   this kind of cosmos-embracing, comprehensive worldview
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.580]   like you get on the Ask Pastor John podcast?
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.340]   Thank you for the question, Eli,
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.380]   and thank you for listening.
