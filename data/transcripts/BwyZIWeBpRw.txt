[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.460]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.140]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.000]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180]   Today, we are going to talk about the biology,
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.320]   psychology, and utility of play.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.380]   Play is something that normally we associate
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.700]   with children's games, and indeed with being a child.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.780]   Much of our childhood development centers around play,
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.520]   whether or not it's organized play or spontaneous play.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.280]   But as adults, we also need to play.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.960]   And today I'm going to talk about what I like to refer to
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.240]   as the power of play.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.560]   The power of play resides in play's ability
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.600]   to change our nervous system for the better
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.460]   so that we can perform many activities,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.440]   not just play activities, better.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.840]   Play can also function as a way to explore new ways of being
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.280]   in different scenarios, in work, in relationships,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.440]   in settings of all kind,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560]   and indeed also in the relationship to oneself.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.880]   In fact, we are going to explore
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.160]   how assuming different identities
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.680]   during the same game of play or the same forms of play
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.920]   has been shown to be immensely powerful
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.040]   for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760]   and dynamic thinking and indeed to become better leaders
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.860]   and more effective workers and students and learners
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.840]   and happier people.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760]   I'm also going to cover some data that shows
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.240]   that learning to play properly
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.160]   can enhance one's ability to focus
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.560]   and is an active area of research
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.440]   for treatment of things like ADHD,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.620]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.080]   Just as a little sneak preview of where that's headed,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.920]   children who do not access enough play
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800]   during certain stages of childhood
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.040]   are more prone to develop ADHD.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.580]   The good news is all of us,
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.040]   regardless of whether or not we have a ADHD or not,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.800]   whether or not we had ample access to play
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   during childhood or not,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.240]   can engage and grow the neural circuits
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   that allow for this incredible power of play.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.040]   And this can be done again at any stage of life.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.280]   Today, we're going to talk about the protocols, the science.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.300]   We will review all of that.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.200]   And I promise you'll come away with a lot of knowledge,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.760]   whether or not you're a parent, whether or not you're a child
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.680]   whether or not you're a person of any age,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.360]   you're going to have tools and knowledge
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.640]   that will benefit you.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   Before we begin, I want to share with you the results
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.360]   of what I think to be an extremely exciting
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   and certainly an actionable study that was just published
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.280]   in the journal Scientific Reports.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.200]   This is an excellent journal, Nature Press Journal,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760]   peer reviewed, et cetera.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.400]   And the findings center around what sorts of devices
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.240]   we happen to be reading on and accessing information on
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.880]   and how that's impacting our physiology
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   and our capacity to learn.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.580]   One of the more frequent questions I get
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.720]   is what are all these devices, phones, tablets, computers,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.240]   video games, et cetera, doing to our brains?
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.500]   And finally, there's some good peer reviewed data
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.960]   to look at that and to address it directly.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.960]   This study, first author Honma, H-O-N-M-A, Honma et al.,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   is entitled Reading on a Smartphone Affects PSI Generation,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.760]   that's S-I-G-H, PSI Generation,
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.720]   Brain Activity and Comprehension.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.640]   And to just summarize what they found,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.000]   they ran a study on 34 healthy individuals
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.380]   and had them either read material on a smartphone
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.020]   or on regular printed paper or a book.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.320]   And what they found is that comprehension on devices,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.440]   in particular smartphones, is much poorer,
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.620]   much worse than it is when one reads on actual paper.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.980]   Now, some of you may experience this yourselves.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.560]   Now, they compared smartphones with paper
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.800]   and what they found was that
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.780]   when they looked at people's breathing,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.260]   the normal patterns of breathing
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.480]   that people were engaging in
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.460]   did not differ between people reading on a smartphone
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.700]   or reading from paper.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.040]   However, one particular feature of breathing did differ.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.200]   And that particular feature
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.100]   is what we call physiological size.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.900]   I've talked a lot about physiological size on this podcast
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.920]   and on social media.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.580]   We had a terrific guest, Professor Jack Feldman
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.200]   from University of California, Los Angeles,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   who's a world expert in breathing and respiration
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.820]   and its impacts on the brain
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.400]   and how brain controls breathing and respiration.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200]   And what you can learn from that episode,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.360]   or I'll just tell you again right now,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.680]   is that every five minutes or so,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.140]   whether or not we are asleep or awake,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.860]   we do what's called a physiological sigh,
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.080]   which is a big deep inhale, often a double inhale,
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.300]   followed by a long exhale and go something like this.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.820]   Now you might think, oh, I never breathe like that,
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.980]   but you do.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.620]   Unless there's something severely wrong
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.000]   with your brainstem, every five minutes or so,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.860]   you do one of these physiological sighs,
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.500]   which reopens all the little hundreds of millions of sacks
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.580]   in your lungs called the avioli that bring in more oxygen
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.500]   as a consequence of that big, deep double inhale.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.220]   And then you are able to exhale carbon dioxide,
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.660]   offload carbon dioxide through that long exhale.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.620]   I've also encouraged people
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.780]   to use the physiological sigh deliberately,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.280]   not just spontaneously,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.380]   as a way to reduce their stress quickly.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.600]   And indeed my lab works on physiological sighs,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.100]   and this has been exploring this,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.980]   and they're quite effective in reducing our stress very fast.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.600]   Reading on a smartphone
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.940]   seems to suppress physiological sighing.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.300]   People aren't aware that it's happening, but it's happening.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.220]   Some people have talked about so-called email apnea,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.180]   which is the fact that people hold their breath
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.080]   while they email or while they text,
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.380]   and indeed many people do that.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.460]   This is distinct from email or texting apnea.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.900]   What's happening here is people are reading on the phone,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.240]   and for whatever reason,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.600]   and I'll talk about what the likely reason is,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.620]   but for whatever reason, they're suppressing their sighing.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.980]   And as a consequence, the brain is not getting enough oxygen
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.520]   and is not offloading enough carbon dioxide.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.780]   And another finding in this study
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.440]   was that the prefrontal cortex,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.340]   an area of the brain that's involved in focus
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.460]   and attention and learning,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.840]   becomes hyperactive in a kind of desperate attempt to focus.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.180]   All of this can be summarized by saying,
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.640]   if you happen to read on a device,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.980]   whether or not it's a tablet,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.960]   standard computer screen of any kind,
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.980]   but in particular on a smartphone,
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.260]   regardless of how small or large that smartphone screen is,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.320]   you want to remind yourself to engage
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.360]   in these physiological sighs fairly regularly.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   And it might even be better to just read the most,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.000]   or at least the key issues
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.700]   and things that you're trying to learn
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.660]   about the key information from paper,
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.620]   either books or printed out material of some other sort.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.020]   What's the underlying mechanism here?
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.020]   Well, one of the reasons I like this study so much
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.520]   is that it brings together two of my laboratories
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   and my particular interests in neuroscience,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.480]   which is how does our visual system and the aperture,
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.320]   meaning the size of our visual window,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   relate to our so-called autonomic function
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.020]   or our internal state?
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.540]   And basically what's happening here is,
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.820]   as any of us bring our visual window in more narrowly,
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.320]   as we contract our visual window,
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.580]   which is exactly what happens
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.380]   when we're looking at a little smartphone in front of us,
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.100]   it seems to suppress the breathing apparatus
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.980]   because we know that physiological sighs
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.900]   are controlled by a specific set of neurons
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.700]   in the brainstem called the parafacial nucleus
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.380]   discovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.660]   And so there must be a mechanism whereby
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.480]   when we tighten our visual window,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.660]   we somehow, and we don't know yet how this happens,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.380]   but somehow suppress the activity of these neurons
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.340]   in the parafacial nucleus
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.980]   that generate this physiological sighs.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.940]   So again, you have two choices,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.420]   or I suppose you have many choices,
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.180]   but two main choices to contend with this new information.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.240]   One is that you remind yourself to engage in deep breathing
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.760]   and in particular physiological sighs
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.940]   every five minutes or so
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.060]   while reading anything or texting on your smartphone.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.620]   The other would be, again,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.240]   if there's material that you really need to learn
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.300]   for sake of regurgitation later
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.540]   or for something particularly important,
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.060]   try and read that from either a larger screen
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.940]   or even better would be from printed materials or books.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.380]   Another reason I bring all that up
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.860]   is that it relates to a larger theme,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.300]   which is that I get many, many questions about ADHD
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.580]   and about people's challenges with focus.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.340]   And much of what we're told these days
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.300]   is that we are challenged with focus
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   because of the hundreds of videos
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.900]   that we can see streaming by us in any moment on our phone,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.540]   which probably is true.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.740]   The fact that the information that we're reading
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.540]   on the internet and on our phones
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.700]   is emotionally disturbing or distressing in some way.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.600]   And that probably is true as well in many cases.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.100]   This study really points to the fact that
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.200]   independent of the information that we are looking at
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.660]   or consuming, independent whether or not it's movies
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.740]   or texts or anything of that sort,
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.160]   the mere size of the window, the aperture,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.980]   the screen that we're looking at
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.460]   is also strongly impacting our ability
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.620]   to learn and remember information.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.000]   So broaden that visual window, print things out,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.020]   look at a book.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.460]   I didn't design the system.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.600]   I always say, you know, however our visual system
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.040]   and respiratory system happened to evolve,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.620]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.200]   This is just simply how your brain circuits work.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.840]   So if you want to learn things, widen that visual window
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.940]   and even better print things out,
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.380]   pick up a book or read on a tablet even,
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.580]   but try and make that tablet larger
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.460]   than a smartphone screen size.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.540]   Before we begin our discussion about the power of play,
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.780]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.140]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.240]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.900]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.660]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.740]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.500]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.540]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, also now called AG1.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.420]   I started drinking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.980]   And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.420]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.540]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.860]   The reason I started drinking it in 2012
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.640]   and the reason that I still drink it once or twice a day
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.300]   is that with Athletic Greens,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.400]   I cover all of my basic foundational
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.020]   vitamin mineral probiotic needs.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.160]   It's filled with adaptogens for recovery.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.140]   The probiotics are particularly important
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.820]   because they encourage health of the so-called
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.300]   gut microbiome.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.380]   We're going to be talking a lot about the gut microbiome
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.000]   on this podcast in the weeks and months to come.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But to make a long story short,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.180]   we have a lot of bacteria living in our gut
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.860]   that are healthy bacteria that support things like digestion,
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.720]   immune system, metabolic function, hormone systems.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.360]   And perhaps most interestingly to me,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.620]   the gut microbiome supports brain function,
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.380]   including mood, cognition, and so forth.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.660]   The probiotics and Athletic Greens strongly support
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.380]   the gut microbiome and thereby the other systems
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.900]   of the body, including the gut brain axis,
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.300]   which I just referred to.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.820]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.240]   again, also called AG1,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.520]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.940]   to claim a special offer.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.700]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.700]   and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.600]   Vitamin D3 is extremely important
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.620]   for many biological functions.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.060]   We are told that we can get enough D3 from sun exposure,
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.500]   but many of us who are getting sun exposure
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.420]   and many of us who are not getting enough sun exposure
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.280]   still don't have ample levels of vitamin D3.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.340]   So supplementing with vitamin D3 is necessary
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.460]   for many, many people.
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.140]   And K2 is important for cardiovascular function,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.820]   for proper calcium balance, et cetera.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.580]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.320]   you can get the five free travel packs,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.380]   the year supply vitamin D3K2,
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.340]   and of course your Athletic Greens.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.940]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.740]   Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.960]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.820]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.380]   And one of the many challenges
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.940]   that your visual system has to deal with is, for instance,
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.580]   when you move from a bright environment
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.920]   to a dimmer environment, you have to adapt.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.500]   You have to be able to see things clearly.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.280]   Many sunglasses and eyeglasses don't allow that adaptation
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.620]   to occur seamlessly.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.160]   Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses allow that to occur
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.540]   in concert with your biology
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.340]   and in a way that makes it very seamless.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.460]   You just don't notice the transition at all,
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.380]   which is wonderful.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.300]   I love it 'cause I don't have to constantly be taking off
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.460]   and putting on my sunglasses when I'm outside.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.900]   I happen to wear readers at night, eyeglass readers.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.780]   It's also terrific
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.020]   as the luminance in your environment changes.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.900]   So they work under low luminance, high luminance, et cetera.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.840]   They're very lightweight.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.220]   In fact, you can wear them when running, when cycling.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.560]   They were designed by two All-American swimmers
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.400]   from Stanford.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.580]   And so originally they were designed
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.960]   for the purpose of being worn during exercise,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.460]   but you can wear them anywhere.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.420]   They have a great aesthetic,
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.940]   so you can wear them to dinner, to work, et cetera.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.200]   And while a lot of performance eyeglasses out there,
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.260]   in my opinion, make people look like cyborgs,
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.020]   Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses have just a terrific aesthetic
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.820]   that you can wear truly anywhere.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.260]   If you'd like to try Roka glasses,
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.580]   you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.100]   and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off your first order.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.480]   Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.580]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.500]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.540]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.060]   that are second to none.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.380]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress about a year ago now,
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.580]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.780]   What's unique about Helix mattresses
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.820]   is that they tailor their mattresses to your sleep needs.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.440]   So if you go to their website,
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.060]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz that asks questions
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.900]   like, do you sleep on your stomach or your back
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.740]   or on your side?
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.700]   Maybe you don't know, do you tend to run hot or cold
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.180]   throughout the night, or maybe you don't know?
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.020]   And it matches you to the mattress
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.680]   that's perfect for your sleep needs.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.900]   I matched to the so-called dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.900]   because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.500]   and not too soft, and so I sleep on a dusk mattress.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.260]   You should figure out what mattress would be ideal for you.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.960]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.820]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.380]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.140]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.740]   and you'll get up to $200 off any of your mattress orders
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.720]   and two free pillows.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.680]   Again, that's $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.520]   The pillows are excellent.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.980]   I also use Helix pillows.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.220]   They have a 10-year warranty.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.620]   You get to try out the mattress
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.220]   for up to 100 nights risk-free.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.400]   If you don't like it, they'll come pick it up, take it away.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.820]   But I think you'll love it.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.680]   Again, if interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.880]   There, you can get up to $200 off and the two free pillows.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.940]   Let's talk about play.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.500]   Now, in researching this episode,
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.280]   I thought that I was going to come across a bunch of papers
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.740]   that say this brain area connects to that brain area,
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.660]   which controls play in animals,
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.580]   and there's similar areas in babies and in adults,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.540]   and indeed, that's true,
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.080]   and we will talk about brain circuitry.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.540]   But I think more importantly is to understand
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.580]   what is the utility of play?
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.140]   You know, why do we play when we're younger?
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.580]   Why do we tend to play less as we get older?
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.440]   And what in the world is play for?
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.520]   Some of us would be categorized as more playful.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.260]   I'm sure that you know people like this.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.080]   Maybe you are like this, people that can walk into a room,
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.480]   a social setting of any kind,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.160]   and they seem to already kind of have a playful,
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.020]   maybe even a mischievous quality about them.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.820]   We'll talk about mischief a little bit later.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.980]   But they sort of look at an environment or a social setting
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.220]   as an opportunity for different kinds of novel interactions.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.020]   Other people, and I'd probably put myself
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.840]   into this category, if I walk into a novel environment,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.660]   I tend to be more in the mode of just assessing
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.260]   what that environment is like.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.040]   I'm not a particularly spontaneously playful person,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.380]   although around certain individuals,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.900]   I might be more spontaneously playful.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.940]   We are all on a continuum of this kind of seriousness
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.140]   to playful nature.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.660]   It turns out that all young animals, including humans,
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.900]   have more playfulness and tend to engage
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.380]   in more spontaneous play in their earlier years
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.700]   than in their later years.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.940]   And therein lies a very interesting portal
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.540]   to understanding what the utility,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.580]   what the purpose of play is.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.420]   First of all, I want to lay down a couple of key facts
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.060]   about play that point to the fact
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.640]   that play is not just about games.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.100]   Play is about much, much more.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.220]   And play, and in particular, how we played as a child,
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.540]   and still how we can play as adults,
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.060]   is really how we test and expand our potential roles
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.680]   in all kinds of interactions.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.540]   One of the most important, interesting,
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.660]   and surprising features of play
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.660]   that I'd like everyone to know about
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.580]   is that it is homeostatically regulated.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.620]   Some of you are familiar with the term homeostasis.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.220]   Homeostasis is just this aspect of biological systems
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.020]   to try and remain in balance.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.620]   If you stay awake for a long period of time,
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.620]   you tend to want to sleep for a long period of time.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.220]   If you slept for a long period of time
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.060]   and you're very rested,
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.780]   then you tend to be very energetic the next day.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.740]   And of course, I know people out there will immediately say,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.120]   "Oh, well, if I sleep too long,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.220]   then I'm groggy the next day."
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.580]   Of course, there are exceptions.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.540]   But in general, sleep and wakefulness
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.860]   are in homeostatic balance.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.020]   Thirst and water consumption are in homeostatic balance.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.760]   If you don't drink any fluids for a while,
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.140]   you tend to get more thirsty.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.420]   You drink fluids and your thirst tends to diminish.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.820]   Likewise with food, likewise with most
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.540]   all motivated behaviors.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.320]   Well, one of the most important discoveries
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.740]   of the last century was largely the work
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.660]   of a guy named Jak Pengsep.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.120]   No, it's not Jack, it's Jak Pengsep,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.280]   who really pioneered this understanding
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.660]   of the biology of play and relating that
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.220]   to the psychology of play in animals and humans.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.500]   He's considered a kind of luminary in the field of play.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.820]   And what a great title to have, right?
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.700]   If you could have a title and be a scientific luminary,
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.960]   you might as well be the play guy.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.460]   In fact, he was known,
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.920]   and I'll get into this later as to why,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.140]   but he was known as the rat tickler
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.320]   because he tickled rats.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.420]   And he actually found that rodents and animals of many kind
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.240]   generate laughter in response to tickling.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.780]   And in fact, they don't have the capacity
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.640]   to tickle themselves.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.680]   Something we'll also talk about why that is.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.620]   And he was called the rat tickler,
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.580]   but then he discovered that many species of animals
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.440]   engage in laughter in response to tickling
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.700]   and they tickle each other.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.700]   And the reason you don't hear them laughing,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.300]   no, you can't hear your dog laughing.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.080]   That isn't laughing, it's something else,
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.860]   is that most animals besides humans
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.460]   laugh at kind of ultrasonic levels of auditory output,
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.120]   meaning the frequencies of sound
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.240]   are just too high for you to hear.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.140]   But with the appropriate devices,
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.660]   he was able with his colleagues
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.740]   to isolate the so-called the rat laughter.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.400]   And then it turns out there's kitten laughter
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.520]   and there's puppy laughter.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.300]   And of course there's human laughter.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.060]   So Jak Pengsup was a very interesting
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.260]   and pioneering person in this field.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.900]   And he also discovered that play is homeostatically
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.860]   regulated, meaning if animals, including children,
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.700]   are restricted from playing for a certain amount of time,
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.180]   they will play more when given the opportunity.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.900]   In the same way that if I food restrict you
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.900]   for a long period of time,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.100]   you will eat more when you are finally allowed to eat.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.620]   And this is important because it moves this thing
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.740]   that we call play from the dimension
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.360]   of higher order functions or things that evolved recently,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.420]   that are really kind of at the front edge
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.060]   of human evolution,
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.180]   deeper into the circuitry of the brain,
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.900]   whereby we say the brainstem,
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.860]   the kind of ancient parts of the brain
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.780]   are going to be involved.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.180]   And in fact, that's the case.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.680]   As we're going to learn later in the podcast,
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.620]   play is generated through the connectivity
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.180]   of many brain areas.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.820]   But one of the key brain areas is an area called PAG,
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.100]   periaqueductal gray.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.540]   The periaqueductal gray is a brainstem area.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.460]   So it's pretty far back as the brain kind of transitions
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.620]   into the spinal cord.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.940]   And it's rich with neurons that make endogenous opioids.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.500]   So these are not the kinds of opioids
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.860]   that are causing the opioid crisis.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.780]   These are neurons that you and I all have
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.180]   that release endogenous,
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.580]   meaning self-made or biologically made opioids.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.960]   They go by names like enkephalin and things of that sort.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.580]   Play evokes small amounts of opioid release into the system.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.380]   They kind of dope you up a little bit,
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.180]   not so much as one would see
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.260]   if one were to take exogenous opioids.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.160]   In fact, exogenous opioids, as we now know,
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.860]   are potentially very hazardous,
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.780]   highly high addiction potential, high overdose potential.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.160]   They cause all sorts of problems.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.740]   Yes, there are clinical uses for them,
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.460]   but they're causing a lot of problems nowadays.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.140]   But these endogenous opioids
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.620]   are released in children and adults
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.500]   anytime we engage in play.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.540]   And that turns out to be a very important chemical state
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.860]   because there's something about having an abundance
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.060]   of these endogenous opioids released into the brain
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.680]   that allows other areas of the brain,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.060]   like the prefrontal cortex,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.600]   the area of the front that's responsible
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.080]   for what we call executive function.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.820]   Executive function is the ability to make predictions,
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.880]   to assess contingencies.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.900]   Like if I do this, then that happens.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.580]   If I do that, then that happens.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.520]   Well, prefrontal cortex is often seen
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.820]   as a kind of rigid executive of the whole brain.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.140]   That's one way to view it,
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.580]   but probably a better way to view it
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.340]   is that the prefrontal cortex works in concert
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.020]   with these other more primitive circuitries.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.320]   And when the periaqueductal gray
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.160]   releases these endogenous opioids during play,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.720]   the prefrontal cortex doesn't get stupid.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.220]   It actually gets smarter.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.780]   It develops the ability to take on different roles
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.840]   and explore different contingencies.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.940]   And we're going to talk about role play later
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.980]   in different contexts.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.140]   And what we will find is that so much of play
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.600]   is really about exploring things in a way
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.780]   that feels safe enough to explore, right?
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.940]   This is not what happens when we drive down the street
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.440]   or when we bike down the street.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.780]   When we are headed to work commuting on our bicycle
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.160]   or walking or driving, we tend to be very linear
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.820]   and we tend to be very goal-directed.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.220]   We're not going to just take a new street just because.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.140]   We're not going to be spontaneously
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.260]   riding in the middle of the road
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.120]   and then on the sidewalk and then back and forth.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.180]   Although I can remember as a kid,
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.020]   I was doing some of that.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.620]   I like to jump off curb cuts when I was a kid.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.380]   And then eventually I graduated, sorry to the cyclist,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.800]   but I graduated to skateboarding.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.340]   And then I look on skateboarding,
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.100]   you're always kind of exploring terrain.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.940]   But you know, as I got older,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.860]   actually I find myself becoming much more linear.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.380]   I just don't play with my commute very much.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.580]   It's really just about getting to work and then working.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.860]   When endogenous opioids are in our system,
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.680]   when we were in this mode of play,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.140]   the prefrontal cortex starts seeing and exploring
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.700]   many more possibilities of how we interact
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.740]   with our environment, with others,
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   and the roles that we can assume for ourselves.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.340]   And so we're going to dissect one by one
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.540]   the different aspects of play, role play, social play,
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.620]   individual play, imaginary play, competitive play.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.620]   There are enormous number of dimensions of play.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.660]   And by the end of this episode,
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.140]   we're going to arrive at a very key feature.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.760]   The key feature is one that's called
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.100]   your personal play identity.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.800]   All of us have what we call a personal play identity.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.180]   This personal play identity was laid down during development
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.560]   and it is the identity that you assume in playful scenarios.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.880]   And it is the identity that you adopt
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.040]   in non-playful scenarios.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.780]   The great news is that your personal play identity
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.100]   is plastic throughout your entire lifespan.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.940]   You can adjust your personal play identity
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.800]   in ways that will benefit you in work and relationships
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.400]   and your overall level of happiness.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.960]   We will discuss protocols and ways to do that.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.580]   But I do want to give a nod to the late Jock, Jock, excuse me,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.220]   Jock Pengsep, the rat tickler.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.520]   And I also want to just give a nod to play generally.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.900]   As we move forward in the discussion,
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.360]   what I'd love for everyone to do
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.140]   is to stop thinking about play as just a child activity,
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.060]   not just a sport related activity,
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.600]   but really as an exploration in contingencies.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.260]   Again, it's an exploration of if I do A, what happens?
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.860]   If I do B, what happens?
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.340]   If someone else takes on behavior or attitude C,
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.700]   what am I going to do?
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.180]   And play is really where we can expand our catalog
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.720]   of potential outcomes and it can be enormously enriching.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.680]   And indeed, as we'll talk about the tinkerers of the world,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.400]   the true creatives,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.660]   the people that build incredible technologies and art,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.400]   and also they just have incredibly rich emotional
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.360]   and intellectual and social lives
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.080]   all have a strong element of play.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.520]   And so today I hope to convince you of some protocols
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.520]   that will allow you to expand your various roles in life
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.260]   through the portal of play.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.760]   So we established that play is homeostatic,
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.560]   meaning we all need to do it.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.000]   Many of us, including myself,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.920]   haven't played that much as adults.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.280]   We're all pretty busy.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.320]   Number of us are stressed.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.900]   We got a lot to do in life.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.760]   But as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.880]   And in looking at the way that very young children
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.080]   and especially toddlers play,
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.920]   we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.400]   by which the toddler brain interacts with the world.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.000]   Now, one of the key things about the baby brain
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.760]   is that the baby brain somehow knows
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.560]   that it can't do everything in the world, right?
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.080]   If a baby needs something,
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.840]   it generally will cry or make some sort of vocalization
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.600]   or some sort of facial expression or combination of those.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.160]   And the caretaker, whoever that may be, will provide it.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.340]   This is an ancient hardwired mechanism
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.240]   whereby the so-called autonomic nervous system
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.000]   that generates stress will create this kind of whining
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.880]   and discomfort, maybe arriving,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.120]   maybe the baby gets kind of red in the face,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   and the caretaker delivers something based on a good guess
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.400]   of what that baby needs.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.200]   So maybe it's breast milk, maybe it's bottled milk,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.720]   maybe it's a diaper change,
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.160]   maybe it's to be warmed up if the baby is cold,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.460]   maybe it's to be cooled down if the baby's too warm,
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.560]   maybe if the baby's in this little onesie thing,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.440]   it's feeling restricted and just wants to move
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.760]   and they'll get taken out of their crib or their stroller,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.240]   whatever it is, and allowed to stretch out on the floor.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.440]   Remember, the baby doesn't know exactly what it needs,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.920]   it only knows the state of discomfort.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.480]   And of course, we don't know exactly
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.400]   what babies and toddlers are thinking
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.320]   because they can't express themselves with language yet.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.440]   But what's key to understand is the rule or the contingency
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.240]   that is set up in that scenario.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   In that scenario, the child feels some discomfort,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   expresses that discomfort verbally
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.120]   or through a facial expression or both,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.320]   and then some force,
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.960]   some person from the outside world resolves it.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.720]   And so the very young baby, and indeed many children
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.320]   up to certain ages, and let's confess,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.840]   many adults are not able to meet
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.960]   or adjust their internal states of stress,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.680]   and so they look to things outside of them.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.180]   That's the first rule, the fundamental rule
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.160]   that we all learn when we come into life,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.440]   that when in a state of discomfort,
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.880]   to look outside our immediate biology
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.960]   beyond the confines of our skin and find a solution,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.800]   a sip of water.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.520]   For adults, it might be a sip of alcohol, right?
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   Probably not the best tool to relieve stress,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.000]   but that's one that many people do in fact engage in.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.080]   For the baby that's hungry,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.780]   the bottle milk comes from the outside.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.160]   As we gain more proficiency in moving through life
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.960]   and we can get things for ourselves,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.760]   we still often bring things from the external world in
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.040]   to resolve this, what I'm calling autonomic discomfort
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.780]   or autonomic dysregulation.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.120]   That's not a game, but that's a rule.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.320]   As we advance from infant to toddler,
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.960]   we start to think more in terms of where we are
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.000]   and what we own relative to what's out there in the world.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.700]   And now in the world of child psychology,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.200]   there's a somewhat famous poem that was written
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.760]   by a research child psychologist.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.200]   His name was Burton White.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.900]   And he wrote a poem called the toddler's creed.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.540]   The toddler's creed defines well what the rules
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.720]   and contingencies of play are in very young children.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.540]   And it reveals to us just how narrow
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.080]   and limited their worldview is
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.880]   and how self-centered their world is.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.800]   So the toddler's creed read quickly,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.240]   'cause I don't want to take up too much time with this,
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.700]   is if I want it, it's mine.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.860]   If I give it to you and change my mind later, it's mine.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.180]   For anyone that's played with a toddler,
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.760]   you can imagine this in your mind.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.440]   If I can take it away from you, it's mine.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.420]   If I had a little while ago, it's mine.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.340]   If we are building something together,
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.060]   all the pieces are mine.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.700]   If it looks just like mine, it's mine.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.100]   If it's mine, it will never belong to anyone else,
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.900]   no matter what.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.400]   And of course, as we hear this,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.700]   it sounds quite awful, right?
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.740]   And yet this is actually a reflection
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.860]   of what a healthy toddler would think about the world,
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.260]   that the objects and things,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.160]   and even the people in the world are theirs,
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.520]   that they are actually possessions that belong to them.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.900]   And of course, some people never actually transitioned
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.300]   beyond this stage of moral and social development.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.680]   And there are indeed some adults
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.100]   that fit the toddler's creed.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.460]   And you're welcome to share this with them
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.280]   if ever you think that it might be of benefit
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.160]   to their self-reflection.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.660]   But in all seriousness, Burton White's toddler's creed
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.400]   is really grounded in this transition
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.480]   from when we are infants
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.720]   and we have to have things delivered to us,
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.400]   to the point where we are toddlers
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.480]   and we can access things in the world,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.800]   but we tend to assume that they are all ours.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.920]   And then the next stage is the really key stage
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.840]   as it relates to play.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.440]   Because in the next stage of development
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.740]   is where young children start to interact
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.000]   with other children, and there's an exchange
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.760]   and a possession and then a letting go of certain things.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.080]   Learning that not everything is yours
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.160]   and that the entire world is not about you
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.960]   is one of the key contingencies
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.640]   that is established during play.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.160]   It's one of the key ways in which children go
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.960]   from being very self-centered
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.120]   and basically unable to engage with other kids for very long
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.040]   without some sort of eruption of crying
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.280]   and some sort of battle of kind of push-pull over an object
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.520]   to things like sharing and things like cooperative play.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.680]   So as we transition from forms of play
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.100]   that are all about the self,
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.800]   that are all me, me, me, me, me, the toddler's creed,
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.200]   to forms of play that involve some discomfort
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.240]   in assuming roles that maybe we don't want
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.420]   and not getting what we want,
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.940]   it's really an opportunity for the brain
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.320]   to start to explore different roles that people take,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.620]   how they work as individuals and as pairs
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.200]   and in larger groups,
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.280]   and to do that in a low stakes environment.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.360]   You wouldn't want this to be worked out on the battlefield
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.860]   or when searching for food
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.840]   or in some high stakes environment
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.120]   where the survival of the species was important.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.880]   It appears that these circuitries for play evolved
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.420]   so that rules and contingencies around who's most important,
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.800]   whether or not the group is important,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.840]   whether or not individuals are going to be leaders
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.200]   or followers, et cetera,
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.720]   that can be explored in a low stakes environment.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.800]   Now, there are hundreds of different types of play
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.560]   and hundreds of different types of contingency testing,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.380]   but the key theme here is that play allows children
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.780]   and adults for that matter to explore different outcomes
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.520]   in a kind of low stakes environment.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.680]   If you're playing a board game or a card game,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.320]   you might get really into that game,
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.520]   but unless there's a lot of money on the table, so to speak,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.600]   or you're really playing for something important,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.080]   or unless your ego is swollen
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.160]   way out of proportion to reality,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.440]   if you lose, you might not feel good about it,
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.040]   but it's truly not the end of the world.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.420]   And if you win, you might feel really good about it,
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.200]   but you're not really incredible.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.040]   You were just incredible in that particular situation
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.200]   for that particular moment.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.840]   It doesn't really transform the rest of your life
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.880]   unless that game is of a particular type,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.520]   for sport, for instance, and we'll talk about sport later.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.700]   So the key theme here is that play is contingency testing.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.540]   Play is contingency testing under conditions
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.420]   where the stakes are sufficiently low
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.500]   that individuals should feel comfortable
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.620]   assuming different roles,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.800]   even roles that they're not entirely comfortable with
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.540]   in their outside life.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.860]   And that all relates again to the release
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.240]   of these endogenous opioids in this brain center,
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.440]   periaqueductal gray,
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.940]   and the way that it allows the prefrontal cortex
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.780]   in a very direct way.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.700]   I mean, truly, it allows it in a biological way
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.600]   to expand the number of operations that it can run
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.500]   and start thinking about, oh, well, okay,
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.900]   normally I'm kind of a loner and I like to read and work
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.100]   and hang out alone, maybe even play alone,
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.200]   but, oh, okay, I'll play a board game or a game of tennis
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.040]   where I have a partner
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   and we're going to play as partners against two other people.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.780]   Okay, that's a little uncomfortable, but I'll do it.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.960]   And in doing that, you discover certain ways
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.220]   in which you are proficient
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.540]   and certain ways in which you are less proficient.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.060]   You discover that the other person
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.980]   actually tends to cheat a little bit
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.100]   or the other person is extremely rigid about the rules,
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.580]   or maybe it is extremely rigid
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.100]   about the way they organize their pieces on the board,
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.240]   or you're crossing the line
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.720]   into your side of the tennis court.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.500]   There are all sorts of things that we learn
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.660]   in these rather low stakes scenarios.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.300]   That's the key theme here.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.480]   So before I continue,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.620]   I just want to point to a tool that anyone can use,
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.840]   but in particular, the less playful of the group.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.360]   And I would put myself into this category.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.000]   Again, I'm not somebody who really engages
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.460]   in spontaneous play.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.580]   I enjoy sports, I enjoy exercise,
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.960]   but that is distinct from play
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.020]   because the sports and exercise that I engage in,
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.100]   I take pretty seriously.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.260]   They're not low stakes for me.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.940]   Actually, I put a lot of importance on them.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.780]   Actually, as I'm saying all this,
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.500]   I probably should put a little less importance on them
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.220]   and have a little more fun with those.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.820]   And yet, what I'm about to tell you is that anyone
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.340]   and everyone can benefit from engaging
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.500]   in a bit more of this playful mindset.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.300]   The playful mindset is not necessarily about smiling
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.900]   and jumping around or being silly.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.740]   That's not it at all.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.380]   It's not the Tigger character from Winnie the Pooh.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.340]   Necessarily, it could be,
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.880]   but it's really about allowing yourself
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.060]   to expand the number of outcomes
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.420]   that you're willing to entertain
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.540]   and to think about how you relate
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.900]   to those different outcomes.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.660]   So what this means is putting yourself into scenarios
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.980]   where you might not be the top performer, right?
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.100]   Playing a game that you're not really that good at.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.960]   I had this experience recently.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.160]   Friends that like to play cards,
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.940]   they like to do some low stakes gambling.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.380]   This is not an illegal gambling ring.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.180]   They play for trivial things.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.180]   And I generally don't buy into the game.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.580]   I generally don't play.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.200]   Mostly because they end up winning
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.660]   and taking whatever it is that I have.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.180]   But in the mode of assuming a more playful spirit,
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.480]   the idea would be, well, if the stakes are low enough,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.780]   then to play simply for the sake of playing,
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.260]   because there's something to learn there
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.260]   about the other people in the group and about oneself
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.620]   and how one reacts to things
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.420]   like someone who's clearly trying to take everybody's money
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.840]   or somebody who is clearly trying to cheat
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.460]   or somebody who's clearly very, very rigid
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.700]   about every last detail,
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.520]   including how the cards are dealt and shuffled, right?
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.820]   There is learning in this exploration.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.640]   And that is at a biological level,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.300]   the prefrontal cortex starting
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.380]   to entertain different possibilities,
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.020]   starting to entertain different outcomes
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.260]   in this low stakes way.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.660]   And if you think about it,
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.840]   that's not something that we allow ourselves
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.720]   to do very often.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.660]   Even if we listen to new forms of music
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.300]   or we go see new art or new movies,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.500]   those are new experiences,
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.820]   but that's not us making new predictions
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.220]   about what's going to happen next.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.020]   It's not the brain working to figure out new possibilities.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:49.100]   And so you can immediately see how just a small increase
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.580]   in your willingness to put yourself into conditions
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.460]   where you don't understand all the rules, perhaps,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.300]   or you're not super proficient at something,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.340]   but you enter it because it is low stakes.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.740]   And because there is information
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.260]   to learn about yourself and others
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.260]   could start to open up these prefrontal cortex circuits.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.500]   And when I say open up,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.780]   I don't mean that literally there's an opening in your skull.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.980]   What I mean is that your prefrontal cortex
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.520]   can work in very rigid ways.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.180]   Meaning if A, then B, if I go down this street,
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.620]   turn left and go that way to work, it is fast.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.100]   If I go down the other street, it's slow.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.320]   If there's a traffic jam there, I'm going to go there,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.600]   but it's starting to explore different possibilities.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.300]   And there are very, very few opportunities in life
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.280]   to explore contingencies in this low stakes way,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.260]   such that it engages neuroplasticity
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.740]   of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.900]   So play is powerful at making your prefrontal cortex
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.240]   more plastic, more able to change in response to experience,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.020]   but not just during the period of play,
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.860]   but in all scenarios, because you get one prefrontal cortex.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.100]   You don't get a prefrontal cortex just for play.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.300]   You get a prefrontal cortex that engages in everything.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.140]   So going forward,
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.180]   I will layer on some more concrete aspects of tools.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.440]   But for now, if you're somebody
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.760]   that doesn't consider yourself particularly playful,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.420]   consider and maybe even engage
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.940]   in just a little bit of play in some way
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.860]   that is of discomfort to you with the understanding
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.520]   that is increasing your prefrontal cortical plasticity.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.960]   Another really interesting and important aspect of play
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.200]   is so-called play postures.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.380]   These are seen in animals and these are seen in humans.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.440]   And for those of you that are watching this podcast
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.400]   on YouTube, I'll do my best to adopt them here.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.380]   For those of you that are listening,
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.120]   you'll just have to imagine them in your mind's eye.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.000]   But Jak Pengsepp and indeed Darwin himself
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.380]   studied these play postures that all animals engage in.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:44.320]   Perhaps the most familiar one is seen in dogs and in wolves
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.360]   where they will lower their head to the ground
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.960]   and they'll put their paws out in front of them
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.780]   and they will make eye contact
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.040]   with another typically dog or wolf
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.320]   to so-called call the play.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   Now, when they do this posture,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.040]   it's obvious that they're lowering themselves.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.640]   They're not in an aggressive stance
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.220]   because they're lowering their head.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.160]   And this is universally known among canines as play posture.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.400]   There's some famous videos online.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.240]   You can look these up of dogs actually doing this
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.300]   with bears that they're confronted with.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.520]   And the bears, at least in these videos,
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.680]   in exchange also lowering their head
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.840]   and there you see bear dog playful interactions.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.760]   Now, you always have to be cautious with bears in general.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   I would say you have to be cautious with bears.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.960]   But this speaks to the universality of this bowing,
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.140]   this sort of what some people call the puppy bow
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.120]   or the play bow that dogs do.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.880]   It turns out that humans do this as well,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.160]   although in a different form,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.400]   I'm sure there are some that go into
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.100]   the down dog play posture,
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.200]   but more typically when humans want to play,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.920]   they will do a subtle or not so subtle head tilt.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.480]   The head tilt with eyes open is considered
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.640]   the universal head and facial expression posture
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.960]   of play in humans.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.680]   So when two people see one another,
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.380]   if they are aggressive towards one another,
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.000]   they will assume certain facial expressions and postures.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.860]   But if they're feeling playful towards one another,
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.460]   oftentimes they'll tip their head to the side
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.200]   just a little bit and they'll open their eyes.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.480]   They might even raise their eyebrows briefly.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.680]   This has been seen again and again and again.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.600]   Another hardwired feature of so-called play postures
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.680]   is what's called soft eyes.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.060]   When animals are aggressive or when they're sad,
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.880]   they tend to reduce the size of their eye openings
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.700]   by basically making their eyelids closer together somewhat,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.640]   but keeping their eyes together
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.760]   in particular for aggression,
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.920]   they'll bring their eyes towards
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.320]   what we call a vergence eye movement,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.440]   bringing it towards the center
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.240]   that actually narrows the aperture of the visual field.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.280]   When people or animals want to engage in play,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.620]   they tend to open their eyelids somewhat
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.840]   and they tend to purse their lips just a little bit.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.040]   So it's not like throwing your lips like this,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.220]   it's pursing their lips,
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.260]   they'll open their eyes a little bit
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.860]   and they'll often do the head tilt as well,
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.660]   sometimes with a little bit of a smile.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.160]   These are reflexive, these are not trained up.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.440]   Children do this, adults do this, dogs, wolves do this,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.420]   even certain birds will do this.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.080]   Most birds have eyes on the side of their heads,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.660]   but they do a sort of form of this soft eyes approach.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.160]   And certainly in raptors, you see a softening of the eyes
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.620]   and indeed raptors like hawks and eagles,
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.600]   they actually do have a certain form of play,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.020]   but only early in life.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.800]   The other thing that we see during play
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.700]   are what are called partial postures.
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.460]   Partial postures are a kind of play enactment
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.140]   of postures that would otherwise be threatening.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.780]   So a partial posture that we see during play
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.900]   in animals and humans that relates to aggressive play,
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.220]   so things like wrestling or things like rough
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.780]   and tumble play, which is very common in animals and kids
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.420]   and some adults, is that because there's going
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.140]   to be a physical interaction in animals,
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.500]   what will happen is they will march toward one another,
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.300]   often very slowly, but rather than having their hair up,
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.100]   which we call pyloerection,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.180]   which is when the hair goes up,
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.800]   animals do this to make themselves look bigger.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.140]   Think about the cat that's trying to look bigger
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.340]   or an animal that's being aggressive,
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.340]   trying to look bigger in the presence of a foe,
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.460]   a different animal that they're either going to try
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.060]   and kill or fight in some way,
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.060]   even if it's to defend themselves.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.920]   Partial postures occur when animals will approach
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.500]   one another, but they'll keep their fur down.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.960]   Humans will do this too.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.060]   They were approached during play,
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.100]   but unless it's highly competitive play,
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.840]   like a football game or a boxing match,
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.340]   they will actually shrink their body size somewhat.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.140]   We have hair on our bodies, some of us more than others,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.240]   and that hair is capable of pyloerection.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.080]   It can stand up.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.920]   That's the hair standing up on end phenomenon,
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.600]   but most of us don't have enough hair on our bodies
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.700]   that we can actually use that to make ourselves larger.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.040]   So what you see with people who are about to engage in play
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.660]   is they tend to make their body a little bit smaller
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.580]   unless they are highly competitive
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.440]   and highly competitive play is its own distinct form of play
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.420]   that we'll talk about later,
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.940]   such as during sport when the stakes are high.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.840]   A Super Bowl football game,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.940]   I'm revealing my ignorance about sports here.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.700]   The Super Bowl as it's typically called
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.020]   is a very high stakes game, right?
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.180]   Salaries depend on it.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.500]   Sponsorships depend on it.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.180]   It's on television.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.340]   Reputations depend on it.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.580]   So that's not really playing a game.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.540]   That's playing a very high stakes game
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.180]   and there you're not going to see these partial postures.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.060]   You're not going to see soft eyes and tilting of the head,
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.300]   at least not between the opposing players on the team.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.840]   You're going to see quite the opposite.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.340]   Grunting, screaming, shouldering, people not blinking,
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.940]   lowering their eyes or rather shrinking their eyes down
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.340]   to appear more aggressive, these kinds of things,
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.260]   staring right through the other person,
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.460]   verbal threats, et cetera.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.080]   So that's not really play,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.260]   even though we say they're playing a game of football,
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.640]   it's very high stakes play.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.780]   What I'm referring to here is when it's fairly low stakes
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.620]   and we see this again in animals and in humans.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.460]   So there are many, many of these partial postures.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.660]   Again, they happen spontaneously.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.060]   So if someone ever looks at you
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.300]   and they tilt their head a little bit
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.540]   and they raise their eyebrows
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.900]   and they maybe smile a little bit,
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.600]   they're looking at you playfully.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.820]   That's the universal human exchange of I want to play.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.020]   Do you want to play?
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.780]   There's another play expression
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.340]   that is considered the most extreme of the,
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.980]   come on, let's play expressions and postures.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.860]   And this is one that's seen in a lot of primates
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.740]   and indeed in some humans as well.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.860]   And that's the eyes wide open
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.700]   and believe it or not, tongue out.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.940]   It's that kind of silly thing.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.860]   I don't think that I've ever done that before.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.780]   Just that kind of thing
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.700]   is basically what primate species of all kinds,
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.700]   and indeed we are old world primates as well,
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.420]   do when they want to say, I'm definitely here to play
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.380]   and that's why I'm here.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.880]   It has this kind of silly look or connotation,
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.840]   but if you watch chimpanzees
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.760]   or you look at bonobos
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.880]   or even in the so-called new world monkeys,
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.840]   which tend to be the smaller monkeys,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.440]   old world monkeys tend to be the ones
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.680]   that in general see the world as we do.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.720]   They have what we call trichromacy.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.820]   They're the ones that often can look very human-like.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.840]   The new world monkeys tend to be the little ones.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.640]   In general, I'll give you a little trick here,
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.000]   a little tool based on primatology.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.980]   If you see a monkey and it's making very slow movements
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.120]   or you see an ape of any kinds making very slow movements,
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.760]   very likely to be an old world primate.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.480]   If you see a monkey and it's making very quick movements,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.680]   like it's doing this kind of thing,
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.280]   like it could be a squirrel monkey,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.000]   could be a marmoset, likely to be a new world monkey.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.920]   And they don't see the world the same way we do.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.220]   They see the world more like a dog.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.280]   They don't really see reds.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.620]   They see reds as orange, et cetera.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.040]   Okay, that's not a hard and fast rule
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.760]   and I'm sure the primatologists are going to come after me
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.640]   with whatever primatologist come after you
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.200]   with monkey biscuits or something like that.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.280]   But in general, it's a good rule if you're at the zoo
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.640]   and you see a slow moving monkey with slow deliberate
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.120]   gestures kind of moves its eyes,
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.720]   makes eye contact every once in a while,
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.060]   those tend to be the old world primates.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.000]   Those kind of jittery ones that look like they're really
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.040]   nervous, wrapping their tail and kind of hiding there
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.920]   in a little bundle, those tend to be the new world monkeys.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.520]   Okay, again, not a black and white type division,
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.520]   but that'll get you most of the way.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.320]   So the whole purpose of these partial postures
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   or the tongue out thing is to limit power in deliberate ways
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.020]   to really take bodily expressions that could be portrayed
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:21.020]   or could be interpreted as aggressive or as threatening
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.020]   or as wanting to mate or as wanting to do anything
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.040]   for that matter and to limit the power
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.360]   with which they are expressed in very deliberate ways.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.380]   So that's the putting the hair down
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.460]   despite getting into a fighting stance.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.520]   That's saying let's fight,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.160]   but I'm not really here to fight fight.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.540]   It's low stakes fighting.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.680]   Like if I pin you, then I'll let you go.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.940]   Or if you pin me, then you ought to let me go.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.220]   And so immediately you can start to see how play
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:51.000]   starts to call into action, social dynamics
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.980]   in which both parties have to make some sort of agreement
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.300]   about how high the stakes are.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.680]   Now, the failures to do this are also very informative
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.760]   in how we develop in social groups.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.940]   And this also can inform why some people really play well
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.320]   with others and other people don't.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.200]   And some people seem to get along well with groups
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   and can handle other people.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.800]   And some people are very rigid.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.120]   In fact, I have an anecdote about this.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.200]   When I was a kid, we used to play this game.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.180]   It's not a game I suggest,
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.720]   but we used to do what were called dirt clod wars.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.680]   So a friend of mine, his parents were generally not home
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.640]   in the afternoon.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.520]   So we must've been somewhere around 10 or 11 years old.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.700]   And we would set up these two big dirt mounds.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.100]   We would shovel them to big dirt mounds
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.400]   on two sides of the yard.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.620]   And then we would just take dirt clods
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.960]   and we throw them at one another
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.180]   and just have dirt clod wars.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.240]   Again, not suggesting this.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.660]   I'm not responsible for what happens if you do,
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.920]   but there were rules.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.560]   And the rules were, for instance,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.720]   you couldn't pack rocks into the dirt clods
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.120]   and you could run across to the other side
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.480]   and you could jump on the other person's mountain.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.680]   You could throw dirt clods in there.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.800]   I guess this is the stuff that we thought was entertaining.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.440]   But if someone got hit in the head,
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.720]   generally there was an unspoken rule
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.600]   that you kind of stop and see whether or not
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.480]   they were damaged or not before you'd continue.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.880]   You couldn't continue pelting them.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.240]   And of course people broke this rule.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.800]   In fact, I remember one kid, I'm not going to name him
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.840]   because actually he's grown into a very prominent
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.100]   and functional adult, but he got hit once in the head.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.040]   And then I think someone had thrown a dirt clod
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.400]   shortly thereafter.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.020]   And all of a sudden he just went into a rage,
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.920]   picking up rocks and sticks and attacking another kid.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.080]   And so clearly that was a case in which the rules
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.000]   of the game were now being violated,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.660]   but it served a very important purpose.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.980]   There was the typical thing that there were some tears,
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.960]   I think, as I recall from one kid or the other,
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.440]   there was like snot coming out of the nose
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.640]   and turning bright red.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.280]   A kid went home, it was a mess.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.880]   The parents had to say something,
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.080]   or maybe there was a phone call.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   I don't quite recall how it got resolved.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.880]   But the idea is that there's an agreed upon set of rules
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.360]   about how high the stakes are
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.640]   and what we're all going to do.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.760]   And this is separate from sport
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.520]   where there are clearly defined rules
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.080]   about what's out of bounds, what's in bounds,
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.880]   what sorts of behaviors will get you a yellow card
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.260]   or a red card, for instance, on the soccer field.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.000]   All animals, including humans,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.880]   are doing this low stakes contingency testing
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.360]   and all animals, including humans, you will find,
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.340]   start to up the stakes.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.660]   And inevitably in group play,
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.320]   one member of the group will kind of break rules.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.320]   You see this also in puppies.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.680]   So for instance, puppies will bite one another
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   with those sharp little needle-like puppy teeth.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.000]   I remember when Costello had those teeth,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.920]   those things were so darn sharp.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.720]   And puppies will yelp
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.960]   when one of their litter mates bites them.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.440]   That yelp actually serves
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.800]   a very important inhibitory function,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   this is well-defined, to tell the other one,
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.620]   that's too tough.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.440]   And this is how animals learn soft bite, okay?
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.320]   If they don't get that feedback from other litter mates,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.560]   they never actually learn what's too hard and what's soft.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.620]   And so humans do this as well.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.960]   Now you can look at your adult counterparts,
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.520]   and indeed we should probably look at ourselves and ask,
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.220]   did we learn proper play contingency when we were younger?
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.840]   Do we tend to take things too seriously?
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.080]   Do we tend to overreact aggressively
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.440]   when other people are clearly engaging in playful jabbing
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.240]   or sarcasm or things of that sort?
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.000]   So each of you will have a different experience of this,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.220]   but the point is that play serves many functions.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.420]   It's not just about the self,
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.740]   it's also about interactions between multiple people.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.140]   It's about rule testing and low stakes contingency.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.300]   Rule breaking also serves an important role,
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.100]   as is with the example of the dirt-clawed war,
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.460]   puppies biting other puppies, et cetera.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.160]   And last but not least,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.420]   there are different forms of play
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.940]   that help us establish who we will become as adults.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.940]   One of the more powerful of these is role play.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.500]   When children and sometimes adults
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.400]   will take on different roles
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.540]   that are distinct from their natural world roles
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.620]   in order to, for instance, establish hierarchies.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.880]   So someone's going to be the leader
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.120]   and someone's going to be the follower.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.500]   Someone will be dominant and someone will be submissive.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.640]   Someone will work alone, other people will work in a group.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.340]   These kinds of role-playing are, again,
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.140]   ways in which the prefrontal cortex
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.180]   has to expand the number of operations.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.680]   In neuroscience, we call these algorithms
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.480]   that it has to run in order to make predictions.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.060]   You have to take in a lot of information
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.520]   about your environment all the time and make predictions.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.440]   But if you are suddenly cast into a new role,
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.880]   well, then you definitely have to make even more predictions
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.180]   from a different standpoint.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.160]   So these are very powerful
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.560]   for teaching the brain how to function.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.540]   I had a sister growing up,
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.220]   I still have a sister, fortunately,
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.100]   and she and her friends largely played
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.600]   with dolls and doll houses in the room next door,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.620]   and they would take on different roles.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.060]   In fact, some kids, if they play alone,
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.520]   will start to take on the role of leader
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.920]   by taking on an imaginary or creating an imaginary friend.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.320]   And my apologies to my sibling, but for a long time,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.240]   she had an imaginary friend.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.960]   Eventually, that imaginary friend disappeared.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.120]   I don't know the science around imaginary friends
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.000]   and what makes them disappear or not
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.560]   at what stage of development,
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.320]   but imaginary friends are pretty common.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.880]   And that's just another way of being able
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.200]   to boss somebody around, if that's your thing,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.940]   or to engage in cooperative play.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.240]   So we can look at this stage of development
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.720]   we call childhood, and we can look at each stage of it,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.880]   and we can say, wow,
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.780]   there are all these different dimensions of play
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.020]   that really are about testing out
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.400]   how we feel, comfortable or uncomfortable,
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.300]   how we react, good or bad,
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.800]   how we react with stress or with glee
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.920]   when others behave in certain ways.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.160]   And so what I'm hoping is coming through
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.040]   is that play is not just about having fun.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.240]   Play is about testing.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.480]   It's about experimenting,
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.040]   and it's about expanding your brain's capacity.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.400]   And that's true early in development,
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.120]   and it's true throughout the lifespan.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.560]   So at this point in the discussion,
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.240]   I want to take a step back,
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.780]   look at the biology and neurochemistry of play
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.160]   just a little bit, and in doing that,
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.720]   really define what is effective play.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.860]   If the goal of play is to explore different contingencies
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.680]   in low stakes environments,
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.840]   and to expand the function of our prefrontal cortex
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.660]   so that we can see new possibilities
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.080]   and new ways of being become more flexible,
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:06.520]   more creative, more effective outside of the games of play,
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.840]   or the arenas of play, I should say,
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.340]   well, then we should be asking,
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.600]   how do I know if I'm playing?
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   How do I know if I'm playing correctly?
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.340]   Turns out there's an answer to that.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.420]   Earlier, I referred to this brain area,
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.520]   the periaqueductal gray,
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.100]   that releases opioids, endogenous opioids,
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.040]   into our brain and body,
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.380]   and tends to relax us a bit.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.500]   It actually is what leads to these things
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.920]   like soft eyes and head tilts and puppies making,
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.440]   you know, puppy postures and things of that sort,
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:41.240]   and how that opens up the number of different functions
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.400]   or algorithms that the prefrontal cortex can run.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.880]   But there's another piece of the puzzle,
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.260]   which is for something to genuinely be play and playful,
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.600]   and for it to have this effect of expanding our brain
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.360]   and engaging neuroplasticity,
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   of really changing our brain so that we can see
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.560]   and engage in more possible behaviors
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.120]   and thoughts, et cetera.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:06.560]   We also have to have low amounts of adrenaline,
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.360]   so-called epinephrine, in our brain and body.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.700]   Now, the background science for this is quite extensive,
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.260]   but for those of you that are interested
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.120]   in papers and manuscripts,
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.460]   perhaps the best one is a review published
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.820]   in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.460]   by the very Jak Pengsep,
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.760]   although he has a co-author,
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.560]   which is Steven Siviy, S-I-V-I-Y.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.440]   I'll provide a link to this in the caption show notes.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.080]   And the title of this paper is
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.100]   In Search of the Neurobiological Substrates
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.160]   for Social Playfulness in Mammalian Brains.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.040]   And it's a quite extensive review,
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.460]   but it basically boils down to some key findings
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:47.460]   whereby any sorts of drugs or behaviors or scenarios
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:51.640]   that increase levels of adrenaline too much
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.840]   will tend to inhibit play.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.680]   And drugs and scenarios, and I'm not suggesting recreational
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.960]   drugs here, but these were experiments that were done
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.640]   in the laboratory setting,
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.120]   that increase the endogenous opioid output
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.160]   will tend to increase playfulness.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.360]   And so really the state of mind that one needs to adopt
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.960]   when playing is, first of all,
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   you have to engage in the play, whatever it happens to be,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.600]   with some degree of focus and seriousness.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.320]   And focus and seriousness in the neurobiological context
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.600]   generally means epinephrine, being able to focus
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.160]   is largely reliant on things like adrenaline, epinephrine,
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.080]   but also the presence of dopamine,
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.840]   which is a molecule that generates motivation and focus
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.780]   in concert with epinephrine,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.220]   but also that these endogenous opioids be liberated.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.800]   And it's really the low stakes feature of play
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.680]   that allows those endogenous opioids to be liberated.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.520]   What do I mean by that?
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.240]   Well, if you are very, very concerned about the outcome,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.260]   like you've put a lot of money on the table
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.120]   in a given game, or you're a football player
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.160]   in the Super Bowl, or you're playing a game
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.160]   for which defeating the other person
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:03.260]   or your team winning is absolutely crucial to you,
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.520]   well, then that's not really going to engage
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.640]   the play circuitry.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:11.560]   On the contrary, if you're engaging in those same behaviors
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.840]   or any other behavior in a way
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.100]   that you're simply there to explore,
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.280]   but you don't have high levels of adrenaline in your system,
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.700]   you're not stressed about the potential outcome,
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.240]   well, then that constitutes play.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.520]   Now that's somewhat obvious on the one hand,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.280]   that you take seriously what you take seriously,
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.540]   and you can be more playful about things
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.220]   that you don't take so seriously.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.600]   But what is absolutely not obvious
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.740]   is that the state of playfulness
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.240]   is actually what allows you to perform best,
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.500]   because the state of playfulness offers you the opportunity
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.560]   to engage in novel types of behaviors and interactions
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.280]   that you would not otherwise be able to access
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.320]   if you are so focused on the outcome, okay?
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.920]   So a state of playfulness is absolutely critical,
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.520]   not just during play,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.260]   but during competitive scenarios of any kind.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.240]   I actually started to cultivate a practice
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.200]   related to this when I was in college.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.000]   I had this general practice
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.280]   of when I wanted to learn something,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.080]   I would tell myself
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.400]   that it was the most important information in the world
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.560]   and that I was very, very interested in it.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.240]   I would kind of lie to myself and say,
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.640]   oh, I'm super interested in, I won't name the topics,
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.960]   but super interested in this or super interested in that.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.720]   And I could sort of delude myself
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.500]   into being hyper-focused on whatever it is
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.040]   that I was learning in ways that surprised me.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.240]   However, when we are hyper-focused on something
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.940]   and we are rigidly attached to the outcome,
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.420]   we can't engage in flexible thinking.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.340]   So it's a great tool to be hyper-focused on something
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.340]   and take it very, very seriously
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.920]   when we're simply trying to learn things
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.180]   by kind of rote memory, learn things and regurgitate,
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.480]   learn and regurgitate of the sort that,
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.800]   frankly, a lot of schooling involves.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.400]   But if we are trying to get better at something,
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.480]   we sort of hit a wall in athletic performance
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.240]   or in cognitive performance where we're not creative enough
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.720]   or we're finding, let's just use a sports example
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.620]   that we only have a certain number of moves
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.800]   that we can deploy or a certain number of swings
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.560]   of the racket that we can deploy.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.280]   The way to actually expand your practice
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.180]   is to engage in this kind of low stakes thinking,
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.240]   the idea that, well, I'm just going to kind of play
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.700]   and tinker, I'm going to explore in a way
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:20.660]   that it doesn't really matter
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.140]   if the ball goes back over the net.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.840]   It doesn't really matter if the ball goes in the hole.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.900]   And it's counterintuitive because you think,
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.400]   no, the thing that we need to do
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.840]   is drill and drill and drill and drill.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.520]   And indeed there's a place for that.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.740]   But this mode of play with modest levels
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:37.200]   of endogenous opioids being released in our system,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.320]   plus low levels of adrenaline, epinephrine,
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.640]   low levels of epinephrine and adrenaline
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.480]   are possible only when the stakes are low enough
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.180]   that we're not stressed.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.180]   Well, that combination really allows the prefrontal cortex
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.500]   to explore different possibilities in ways
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.940]   that can truly expand our capabilities over time.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.440]   Now, this has been seen again and again,
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.620]   also in the business sector,
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.280]   some of the more challenging
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.820]   or I should say competitive companies to get jobs at
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.580]   are very interested in hiring people
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.980]   that as children were so-called tinkerers.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.040]   And actually NASA was first famous for this,
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.160]   that many of the people that achieved great success
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.740]   in engineering at NASA,
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:19.960]   when they looked back into their childhood histories,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.540]   those people tended to be tinkerers.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.340]   They were people that would kind of play with things
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.820]   in a way that wasn't about rigidly following a recipe
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.100]   or an instruction manual.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:31.580]   Great cooks discover new forms of food,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.740]   indeed created entire genres of food
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.820]   by way of being tinkerers, okay?
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.820]   Musicians do this.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.820]   I grew up playing various sports,
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.200]   but skateboarding was one that
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.240]   I was particularly involved in for a long time.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.820]   One of the greatest skateboarders of all time is,
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:48.080]   some of you may recognize his name
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.640]   is the great Rodney Mullen.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:54.140]   And Rodney was kind of famous for evolving the sport
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.220]   and continuing to evolve the sport
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:56.560]   in ways that no one could predict,
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.520]   using skateboards and all sorts of ways
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.260]   that no one had thought of previously.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.460]   And of course there are other skateboarders
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.600]   that did that as well,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.660]   but he's particularly well known for that.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:08.540]   And his process is his own, I can't speak to it too much,
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.700]   but he was also known as a kind of a tinkerer
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.540]   as somebody who would spend a lot of time
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.940]   just kind of flipping the board
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.620]   and just flipping it in the air
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.200]   and watching the ways in which it flipped
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.860]   and kind of studying the physics of it really
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.820]   and expanding on his existing understanding
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.760]   of what could happen on a skateboard
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.180]   by way of just playing.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.940]   Now he took it very seriously,
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.060]   but it's this kind of razor's edge
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.740]   between taking something very seriously,
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.180]   but also tinkering and playing and exploring
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.940]   and just seeing what happens and kind of like,
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.980]   well, let's just see what happens if we did this.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.720]   That mindset is extremely powerful to export
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.340]   from this thing that we call play
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.720]   into what we could call more serious endeavors
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.800]   of one's occupation or sport,
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.100]   whether or not it's behind a desk
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.620]   or whether or not it's running around on a field
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.700]   or engineering, any endeavor.
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:58.700]   And so the whole purpose of this episode on play is yes,
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.180]   on the one hand to illustrate
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.500]   the incredible evolutionary utility of play
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.840]   for setting up the self and relation of the self to others,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.780]   indeed for setting up cultures entirely
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.840]   'cause cultures will watch sport together
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.580]   or they'll celebrate their team winning.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.920]   I mean, World Cup, I've never been a big soccer fan,
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:18.100]   even though my dad is Argentine, but it's incredible.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.460]   I mean, the entire world kind of lights up
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.620]   and gets engaged around whether or not their team,
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.700]   their country is going to win.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.780]   The Olympics also being another example.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:28.660]   But play and sport are not quite the same
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.980]   as I've pointed out before.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.000]   And for all of us who are thinking about tools
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.600]   and things that we can extract from science
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.060]   to enrich our lives, I would say,
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.960]   for those of you that are already playing on a regular basis
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.680]   in one form or another, terrific.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.000]   Start to expand other forms of play,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.200]   in particular forms of play
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.060]   that involve new groups of individuals.
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.520]   So if you're somebody that typically plays one-on-one
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.020]   with somebody, try to expand into playing as teams.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.000]   If you're somebody who only plays alone,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.620]   then try to expand into playing in perhaps one-on-one first
[00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.460]   and in groups.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.600]   This is the way that your brain learns and evolves
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.280]   and changes and gets better.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.120]   And I raise this because another one of the top 10 questions
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.420]   I get is how can I keep my brain young?
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.960]   How can I continue to learn?
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.420]   How can I get better in school, in sport, in life,
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.040]   in relationships, et cetera, emotionally, cognitively,
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.320]   and on and on and on.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.340]   And yes, there are supplements
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.980]   that can support neuroplasticity.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.980]   Yes, there are brain games and apps
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.780]   that can support neuroplasticity.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.480]   But if you really want to engage in neuroplasticity
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.120]   at any age, what you need to do is return
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.580]   to the same sorts of practices and tools
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.360]   that your nervous system naturally used
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.300]   throughout development.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.860]   And that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.480]   to trigger this thing that we call neuroplasticity.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.580]   And the reason this is so important is because it starts
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.800]   to move us away from what some people called hacks.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.680]   I define hacks as using one thing for a different purpose
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.620]   to kind of get a shortcut.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.580]   I don't really like the term frankly,
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.180]   and I don't like it because it's not grounded
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.040]   in any biological mechanism.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.300]   But when we look at play, we can say play
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.220]   is the portal to plasticity.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.320]   Play at every stage of life is the way
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.340]   in which we learned the rules for that stage of life.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.440]   And play is the way in which we were able
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.740]   to test how we might function in the real world context.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.560]   So play is powerful.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.540]   And we could even say that play is the most powerful portal
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.460]   to plasticity.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.460]   The reason for that is that yes, this high opioid,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:31.220]   low epinephrine or adrenaline state is what opens up play.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.900]   But then inside of the arena of play,
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.380]   when the prefrontal cortex is running
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.960]   all these different possibilities in this low stakes way,
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.320]   but with some degree of focus,
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.960]   there are a number of other chemicals that are deployed.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.080]   Things like brain derived and trophic factor
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.480]   and other growth factors that actually trigger
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.720]   the rewiring of brain circuits that allow for it to expand.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.520]   And indeed that's what is neuroplasticity.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.980]   If you're interested in those chemicals
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.100]   and the kind of arena of things that happen
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.080]   when one engages in neuroplasticity,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.020]   there's a vast literature out there.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.180]   But one of the more popular books
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.220]   that I think is quite good is from my friend
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.300]   and colleague, John Rady,
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.260]   who's a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.860]   That's R-A-T-E-Y.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.020]   He wrote the book "Spark" a few years back.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.500]   And I think it's still very relevant.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.940]   And John talks about the important role
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.680]   that play exerts in the neuroplasticity process
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.340]   and points to a number of different protocols
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.600]   that one can engage in.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.800]   He also points to the importance
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   of navigating new environments
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.700]   to not just go on the same hike every week
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.640]   or take the same walk,
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.820]   but actually get into new novel environments.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.120]   So you're starting to sense a theme here.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.980]   There's novelty, exploring contingencies,
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.140]   keeping the stakes relatively low, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.700]   But these really are the gates to this holy grail
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.560]   that we call neuroplasticity.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.360]   Neuroplasticity, as I've talked about in the podcast before,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.640]   is a two-step process.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.360]   It involves focusing very intensely
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.100]   or at least focusing somewhat
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.000]   on whatever it is that one is trying to learn,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.920]   and then engaging in deep rest, ideally deep sleep,
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.960]   in the following nights.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.560]   And I've also talked about the benefits
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.300]   of things like naps and yoga nidra,
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.840]   so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.540]   for enhancing or accelerating plasticity.
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.900]   You can check out the episodes on focus at hubermanlab.com
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.240]   or the episodes on how to learn faster,
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.180]   the detail, all of those.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.180]   We had a newsletter that lists out all the tools
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.160]   for neuroplasticity, enhancing neuroplasticity.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.260]   All that is available, zero cost to you
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.660]   at hubermanlab.com, et cetera.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.120]   You can just download that information.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.520]   But John's book, that newsletter, those episodes,
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.220]   they really point to this two-step process
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.440]   where it's focus and then rest, focus and then rest.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.200]   And play is its own unique form of focused and then rest,
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.040]   focus and rest.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.000]   It's not the same as learning something for sake of school
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.640]   or critically trying to learn a motor behavior
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.880]   for sake of sport.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.520]   It's really about expanding the number of things
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.900]   that you could learn down the line, okay?
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.300]   So said once again,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.880]   so I just want to make sure it's abundantly clear,
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.000]   play is about establishing a broader framework
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.960]   within which you can learn new things.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.320]   It's not about learning some specific thing.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.920]   It's not about the game you happen to be playing.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.600]   It's not about the dollhouse that the kids are playing with
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.920]   so that they can become amazing dollhouse players
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.160]   when they grow up, right?
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.600]   The dirt-clawed war that I referred to earlier,
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.000]   for better or for worse,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.080]   was not about becoming the best dirt-clawed thrower
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.240]   or winning the trophy for dirt-clods in the neighborhood,
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.560]   although we actually had a trophy
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.720]   for the best dirt-clawed team.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.960]   Alas, it was not my team that year.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.680]   But the point is that you're learning rules
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.080]   and establishing a broader foundation of practices
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.800]   that then you can learn more things within that context.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.300]   Thus far, I've tried to convince you
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.460]   through a combination of data and anecdote
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.720]   and explanation that adopting a stance of playfulness
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.040]   and indeed engaging in play on a somewhat regular basis
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.140]   could be beneficial to you
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.540]   regardless of circumstances or goals.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.160]   If I haven't done that already,
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.840]   what I'm about to tell you hopefully
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.360]   will push you over the line.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.000]   It turns out that when you look across
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.240]   the kingdom of all animals,
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.120]   what you find is that animals that engage
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.000]   in playful behaviors for the longest period of time
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   are also the animals that have the greatest degree
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.800]   of neuroplasticity, the brain and nervous system's ability
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   to change in response to experience.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.920]   Put differently, animals that only play
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.340]   for a very small fraction of their entire life
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.820]   have very rigid brains that don't learn new things,
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.240]   whereas animals that play for a long period
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.880]   throughout their life have very plastic brains.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.960]   And there's even some evidence
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.920]   that's at this point largely anecdotal,
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.160]   but there's some data starting to emerge
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.500]   that adults that maintain a playful stance,
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:59.500]   that engage in things, again, that are low stakes,
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:04.600]   contingency exploring, important enough that people focus
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.760]   and that people pay attention to what they're doing,
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.880]   but that they are not filled with adrenaline,
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.680]   freaked out about the outcome being A or B.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.280]   They're not super, super competitive,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.640]   maybe just a little bit competitive
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.420]   or not competitive at all.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.800]   That allows for more ongoing plasticity.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.240]   And one of the people that comes to mind
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.820]   in thinking about this is, of course, the physicist,
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.800]   and I should say the great physicist, Richard Feynman,
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.720]   Nobel Prize winner, professor at Caltech,
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.400]   was involved in the Manhattan Project,
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:38.120]   but was also known for being a lifelong tinkerer, right?
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.840]   He also was a mischievous tinkerer.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.920]   If you read any of the books about Feynman or by Feynman,
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.400]   surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman,
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.080]   or what do you care what other people think?
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.280]   These are wonderful short stories,
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.600]   mostly about Feynman doing things like picking all the locks
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.900]   at the Los Alamos laboratory
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.520]   and putting all the top secret documents
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.880]   out on the floor of the office
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.200]   so that when people came in in the morning,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.560]   they were all out there.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.140]   Obviously, they weren't released to the general public.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.080]   He didn't want to threaten national security,
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.920]   but playing pranks like that.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.800]   And actually Caltech, I don't know if this is still the case,
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.160]   but Caltech, where he was employed,
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.860]   was always known for doing very technologically
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.800]   challenging pranks.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.280]   They're not known for their athletic prowess at Caltech,
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.480]   sorry, Caltech, but they were known, for example,
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.720]   disrupting the scoreboard at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.400]   for instance, and things of that sort
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.200]   through technological feats that at least at the time
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.220]   required a lot of playfulness and technological prowess.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.840]   So if you look in science or you look in art
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.260]   or you look in medicine or you look in any domain,
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.400]   what you find is the people that continue
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.400]   to evolve new practices tend to be people
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.660]   that were tinkerers, people that are very creative,
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.640]   tend to be people that are unafraid of exploring things
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.080]   in this low stakes way.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.320]   They're not so rigidly attached to the outcome
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.480]   that they have to do everything perfectly all the time.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.120]   Now, they might cloak these playful behaviors
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.720]   so that their final works always look perfect
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.060]   or always look incredible,
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.960]   but they have this kind of playful nature about them.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.120]   I would venture even to say that the street artist Banksy,
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.080]   for instance, obviously an incredible artist
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.480]   puts a ton of thought and preparation into their work,
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.880]   but there's a kind of playfulness to the whole thing too
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.860]   of using two-dimensional paintings in concert
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:25.040]   with three-dimensional city dwellings in ways that,
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.920]   you know, I think that most people hadn't previously.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.220]   There were other people like Christo
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.380]   and artists of that sort that did that.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.820]   But I think Banksy is kind of recognized
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.920]   as the modern rendition of that kind of playfulness
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.160]   using cities in ways that most people don't use cities,
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.480]   using art in ways that most people don't use art,
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.720]   for instance.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.000]   So to go back to the example of Feynman,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.840]   Feynman was somebody who learned to paint
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.160]   and draw quite well into his 60s.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.720]   He was somewhat famous or infamous, I should say,
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.260]   for bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.260]   I say infamous because he was known also
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.460]   for doing that naked,
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:02.540]   something that is certainly not in concert
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.700]   with the ethical standards and behaviors
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.960]   of universities today.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.200]   But Feynman had this playful spirit as a child,
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.860]   he had that playful spirit as a teenager,
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:14.400]   and he had that playful spirit as an adult.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.800]   And that's one of the hallmarks of Feynman
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.000]   was that he wasn't just a rigid physicist
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.240]   who could explain things clearly to the general public.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.880]   He always carried through this playful spirit.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.240]   And in some of his writings,
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.160]   he pointed to the fact that that playful spirit
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.080]   was something that he worked very hard
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.320]   to continue to cultivate in himself
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.320]   because it was the way in which he could see
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.880]   the world differently and to indeed make great discoveries
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.920]   in the field of physics,
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.240]   but also to kind of evolve his relationship
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.200]   to life more generally.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.840]   And so he comes to mind as a prominent example
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.660]   of somebody who did this.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.140]   And if I could achieve anything with this episode,
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.800]   besides teaching you something about the biology of play
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.520]   would be to teach you about the utility of play.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.140]   Again, I don't consider myself
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.880]   a particularly playful person by nature,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.660]   but I've tried over the years to adopt this stance
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.240]   of exploring things that are very focused
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.240]   on contingencies of different kinds,
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.720]   but keep the stakes low enough
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.360]   that I can have some fun doing them.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.960]   And I like to think that it's benefited me somewhat.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.400]   Now I'd like to drill a little bit further
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.000]   into this thing that we call neuroplasticity.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.960]   Again, neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous systems
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.360]   ability to change in response to experience.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.400]   And I should just say that throughout the entire lifespan,
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.440]   the nervous system can change very quickly
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.900]   in response to negative experiences.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.920]   We can almost all engage in what's called
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.280]   one trial learning where if something really terrible
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.860]   or traumatic happens to us,
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.880]   our nervous system will rewire almost immediately,
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.440]   at least within a few days,
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.160]   such that we tend to want to avoid the experience
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.560]   that led to that trauma.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.420]   Now the whole business of why people return to things
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.480]   that are traumatic to them is a whole other issue.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.600]   There are books about things like trauma bonding.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.380]   There's the so-called repetition compulsion
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.840]   from psychoanalysis that people go back into trauma
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.900]   to retest and gain new opportunities
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.920]   to overcome the trauma, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.960]   But in general, what I'm referring to here is,
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.140]   you know, you have a bad experience at the swimming pool
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.520]   when you're a kid where someone holds your head
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.360]   under water too long,
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.020]   and then you just don't want to get back in the water.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.660]   That's one trial learning of sorts.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.460]   That of course can be overcome
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.520]   through proper exposure therapy
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.640]   or someone that you trust taking you there,
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.960]   or any number of behaviors that allow you to overcome
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.860]   that particular scenario and experience something new
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.900]   in that same context.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.580]   But across the lifespan, the learning of new things,
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.920]   new contingencies, new possibilities occurs very differently
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.440]   from about age zero when we're born
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.980]   until about age 25 and thereafter.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:47.080]   So from about, I want to emphasize approximately age 25
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.680]   onward, neuroplasticity occurs through the process
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.080]   that is exactly as I described before.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.440]   Focus, rest, focus, rest.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.760]   We focus very intensely.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.800]   We can't do the thing.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.960]   We can't do the new movement.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.180]   We can't do the golf swing.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.160]   We can't learn the math.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.620]   We try, we try, we try, we try.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.720]   We sleep a few nights,
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.020]   and then all of a sudden we can do it, right?
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.560]   Because the rewiring actually occurs during deep rest
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.880]   or naps, but mostly during deep sleep.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.300]   From birth till about age 25, however,
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.760]   we can learn things, new things and new contingencies,
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.940]   not just negative things and traumatic things
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.480]   through somewhat passive exposure to those things, right?
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.460]   I will never forget the first time
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.900]   that we went on a family trip to Washington, DC,
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.120]   and we went to the Smithsonian.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.020]   I got to see the old fighter planes.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.460]   And I think, I think the Kitty Hawk
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.400]   or the first one of the first planes was there.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.700]   Anyway, obviously my recollection isn't terrific.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.500]   My hippocampus is flailing on that one,
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:44.780]   but I'll never forget the trip
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.940]   and I'll never forget who went.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:48.660]   And I think it was probably eight or nine years old.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.540]   It's embedded somewhere in my memory.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.020]   And so just through passive experience
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.420]   and my focusing on the things that excited me
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.220]   about that trip, I have a recollection of that experience.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.380]   I didn't have to deliberately focus.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.940]   I wasn't telling myself, focus,
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.560]   you're going to need to remember this trip someday
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.340]   and you're going to be podcasting about this
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.900]   in 39 years or whenever.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.560]   Again, I forget exactly how old I was.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.840]   But the key feature here is that the developing brain
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.780]   is able to learn through passive experience
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.840]   because the neurons, the nerve cells in the developing brain
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.740]   are much more over-connected
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.740]   than they will be later in life.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:28.980]   The way to think about this is sort of,
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.500]   if you use Google Maps as I do too often, I think,
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.500]   when I drive, there are a number of roads and pathways
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.400]   that would get you from point A to point B.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.500]   We could imagine those as neural circuits,
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.240]   or we can imagine neural circuits as those roads.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.880]   Early in development,
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.020]   the nerve connections are much more extensive.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.320]   It's like having a Google Maps
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.960]   where everything is connected to everything
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.240]   through tiny little cross streets
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.540]   and the whole thing is just a complete mess.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.440]   But then by taking particular routes of behavior,
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.940]   of thought, of emotion,
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.220]   certain routes become well-established
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.260]   and the other routes that are not taken simply disappear.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.680]   Now, in the biological context, in the brain,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.760]   we call that process pruning.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.360]   And the simple way to envision this is early in development,
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.380]   you have many, many more neurons than you will have
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.420]   as an adult.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:24.100]   Those neurons are extensively interconnected
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:27.460]   and approximately 40% of those interconnections
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.000]   will disappear by time you're 25 years old.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.200]   They are gone.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.860]   They are actively removed through processes
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.520]   that involve things like glial cells that come in
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.080]   and literally sneak their little processes
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.280]   in between neurons at the synapse,
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.440]   which are the points of contact
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.600]   and communication between neurons,
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.280]   and push those apart, even eat neurons, right?
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.320]   There's some incredible work from, for instance,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.400]   Beth Stevens' lab at Harvard Medical School
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.680]   showing that glial cells go in and eat synapses
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.340]   that are not functional for that particular circuit.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.800]   Now, what this tells us is that much of our learning
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.160]   during development is the removal of incorrect connections,
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.840]   but it also involves the strengthening of connections
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.640]   that are going to serve certain emotions, certain functions,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.940]   motor functions, cognitive functions, et cetera.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.940]   The process of play is largely a process
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.100]   of engaging pruning of neural connections
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.980]   and strengthening of the remaining connections.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.500]   I'm sure that many of you have heard the term
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.720]   fire together, wire together.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.420]   That phrase is often incorrectly attributed
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.740]   to the great Donald Hebb, who indeed was great,
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.060]   did incredible work, a psychologist from Canada
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:42.780]   who established a lot of the basic cellular learning rules
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.340]   for learning and memory,
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:48.180]   but it was the also great Dr. Carla Schatz,
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:51.380]   who is now at Stanford and was at Berkeley
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.860]   and Harvard as well, but who is at Stanford Medical School
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.160]   who coined this term fire together, wire together.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.980]   Indeed, that's what happens.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:02.740]   When children play, when adolescents play,
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.620]   and when young adults play,
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.900]   whether or not it's social play or play with an object,
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.780]   whether or not it's a sport or a play of any kind,
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.080]   imaginary play, imaginary friend play,
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.440]   there is a strengthening of certain neural connections
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.400]   and a pruning away of up to 40%, perhaps even more,
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.460]   of connections that are not necessary
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:28.160]   for certain types of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.320]   What this means is that it is through the process of play
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.740]   that we become who we are as adults.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.820]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.740]   it is through the process of play
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:41.600]   that we are able to adjust who we are as adults.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.340]   Now, there are bounds on this process.
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.220]   As far as I know,
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:48.500]   there's never been a reported case of an individual
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.700]   who had a hyperplastic, or I should say a brain
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:57.500]   that was as plastic in adulthood as it was in childhood.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:01.340]   But what this tells us is that what we do
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.540]   in the process of play as children
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.000]   is really how we set up the rules
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.120]   for how we behave as adults in almost all domains,
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.480]   which is really incredible.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.220]   And of course, the reassuring thing is that
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.160]   playing as an adult will allow you to expand
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.060]   on those neural circuits.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.960]   You can literally grow new connections.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.660]   Some of you may be saying, does it create new neurons?
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.720]   For better or for worse,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.420]   it does not seem that many new neurons
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.300]   are added to your brain in adulthood.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.920]   There are some papers that report a few neurons
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.540]   in certain brain areas, isolated brain areas,
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.380]   but by and large,
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.060]   most of the rewiring of neural connections
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.980]   is the removal of certain connections,
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:37.640]   this process we're calling pruning,
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.460]   and the strengthening of the remaining connections
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.300]   that make those kind of Google maps roads
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.820]   in the analogy I laid out before,
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.100]   thicker and more robust.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.140]   Think of that as taking little trails
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.220]   and turning them into roads,
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.380]   then paving those roads,
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.960]   then turning those roads into highways,
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.700]   then putting up more lanes on those highways
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.300]   and eliminating all the small little back country roads
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.660]   that one could take.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:01.140]   And again, this is an analogy for what is happening
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.980]   at the level of neural circuitry.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:05.540]   Now, one of the key findings
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.180]   that has emerged from the literature
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:13.180]   is that children that have been subjected to trauma
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.980]   or immense amounts of stress of any kind
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.660]   have a harder time, both engaging in play,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.260]   but also a harder time accessing neuroplasticity
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.700]   later in life.
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.220]   The good news is this is not a permanent effect.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:27.300]   And we'll talk about some of the ways
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.540]   to overcome that in a moment,
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.060]   but this should make sense to you
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.180]   because earlier we talked about
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.780]   how a high level of adrenaline epinephrine
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.460]   in the brain and body actually inhibits,
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.180]   blocks the circuits in the brain and body
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.380]   that generate play behavior.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:47.900]   And when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way,
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:49.940]   that epinephrine and adrenaline
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.640]   can actually suppress the sorts of circuitry
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.340]   that can lead to things like soft eyes or tongue out
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:00.460]   or the head tilt or what we called partial postures
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:04.460]   of being able to engage in a rough and tumble play,
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.840]   but not take that to the point of outright aggression
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.200]   in damaging the other person or them damaging you.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.120]   So when I say that trauma and stress
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.640]   can inhibit neuroplasticity by way of inhibiting play
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.540]   at a deeper neurobiological level,
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.520]   what I'm really saying is that the high levels of adrenaline
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.420]   that are generated from trauma and stress
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.640]   actually shut down the circuits
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.600]   that allow a child or a young adult
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.580]   to enter the game of play or engage in the game of play
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.380]   in the same way that a child or young adult
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:39.140]   who didn't have high levels of adrenaline in their system
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.000]   could possibly engage in.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.560]   Now, the good news is
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.740]   that many of the existing trauma therapies
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:45.580]   that are out there now,
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.260]   including things like EMDR, exposure therapy,
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.580]   cognitive behavioral therapy, and on and on,
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:55.180]   including some of the therapies that are more neurochemical,
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:59.160]   things like ketamine or are more engineering-based,
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.100]   things like transcranial magnetic stimulation, for instance,
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.540]   many of those are paired with forms of talk therapy
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.380]   that are really about the same thing that play is about,
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.580]   which is exploring different contingencies.
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.500]   It's about exploring different types
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.260]   of emotional experiences as they relate
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:19.380]   to the same sort of scenario that created the trauma.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.900]   And we did an entire episode on fear and trauma,
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.740]   and I recommend you check out that episode.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.860]   It's easy to find, again, at hubermanlab.com.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.060]   It's on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:28.940]   Very easy to find.
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.360]   And there, I talk all about trauma treatments
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.260]   and the various kinds of trauma treatments
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.140]   that are out there, their efficacy in different scenarios
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:37.960]   and traumas and so on.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.660]   But the point I'd like to make now is that the reason
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.380]   why children who experience a lot of trauma and stress
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.180]   have limited plasticity later on
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.920]   is because of the neurochemical substrates
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.400]   that are created from trauma and stress,
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.660]   because after all, stress is epinephrine
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.880]   and epinephrine is stress.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.640]   Those are inseparable.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.380]   And the way in which it more or less shuts down
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:02.100]   or at least inhibits, suppresses those play circuits.
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.360]   And again, the reassuring thing is that by engaging in play
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.420]   as adults, we can reactivate some of those circuits
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.140]   and reopen the plasticity.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:14.680]   In fact, one very prominent trauma treatment now,
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.220]   especially for people that have been subjected
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.360]   to very severe traumas in the ongoing sense,
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.200]   meaning traumas that went on for many, many years,
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.540]   is to get them to engage in play, in things like dance,
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.820]   in basically getting them to engage their bodily movements
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.620]   in ways that they would otherwise
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.460]   not feel comfortable to engage in.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.640]   And I find this area so interesting
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.500]   because on the face of it, you could say,
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.100]   oh, that's kind of, is that really biomedical treatment?
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.260]   You're taking people who are traumatized
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:43.420]   and having them dance.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.460]   I mean, it seems kind of silly on the one hand,
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:50.460]   depending on your particular orientation.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:54.520]   But on the other hand, it's actually quite profound
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.560]   and quite grounded in the mechanisms
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.420]   by which the brain circuits change.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.340]   So again, back to this original principle,
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:05.660]   which is that play isn't just one portal to plasticity,
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.820]   play is the fundamental portal to plasticity.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.820]   And that play and dance and exploration of novel movements,
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.400]   exploration of novel athletic movements are the route
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.900]   by which we access new ways of thinking, new contingencies.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:24.160]   And I find it wonderful that the trauma release
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.080]   and the psychiatric and psychology community
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.940]   are exploring things like play and dance
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.260]   and other forms of reopening these circuits
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.820]   because indeed we would all love for there to be
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:40.300]   a magic pill by which trauma could be erased
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.860]   and new memories could be laid down
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.520]   or a device that could do that.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.740]   But frankly, if you ask me or a number of my colleagues
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   whether or not that's likely to happen anytime soon
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.900]   in an effective way,
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.860]   I think the short answer is going to be no,
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.340]   that there are going to be chemicals
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:57.200]   and things that can augment and support that process,
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.980]   but that there's not going to be just a magic pill
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.040]   that will suddenly reverse trauma altogether,
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.880]   that it's always going to be a case
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.520]   whereby shifts in neurochemical states
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.760]   are going to have to be combined
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.820]   with new ways of thinking and new behaviors.
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:11.860]   And I find it wonderful and reassuring
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.540]   that people are looking at play and play behavior
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.620]   as a not just one tiny shard of possibility there,
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.000]   but that it might actually be the main driver
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.960]   and a highly productive lever by which
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   to rewire the traumatized brain.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.420]   So if you're like me, you might be thinking,
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.200]   okay, I'm willing to be more playful.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.940]   I'm willing to explore play as a portal to plasticity.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:39.240]   And that all makes good sense, but what should I play?
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.520]   What should I do?
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.980]   Well, we've already established
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:44.620]   that you want to keep your adrenaline low.
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.640]   You have to keep the stakes low enough
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.560]   that you're not going to get totally consumed
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.060]   by the outcome.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.340]   Now, for some people who are highly competitive,
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.640]   that's going to be challenging.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.360]   And yet I don't want to make it seem
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.680]   as if you can't be competitive during play.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.940]   There are many forms of competitive play
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.360]   that because you are a competitive person,
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.180]   allow you to derive great joy from that competitive play.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:10.060]   I have a friend who's particularly good at horseshoes.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.500]   I'm not particularly good at horseshoes,
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.940]   but whenever we play horseshoes,
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:17.540]   I can tell he's out there to crush me on horseshoes.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.940]   And it's just one of these things where I can tell
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.400]   he derives great pleasure from crushing me
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.980]   at a game of horseshoes.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:27.140]   I can't say because I haven't actually done the micro-dialysis
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.380]   which is a way of extracting chemistry
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.100]   from the brain in real time,
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.380]   nor have I recorded from his brain or imaged it in a scanner
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.660]   whether or not he has high levels of epinephrine
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:39.020]   or low levels of epinephrine during those games of horseshoes
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:40.980]   I suspect is low levels of epinephrine
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:43.700]   and high levels of dopamine, especially when he wins.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.700]   And yes, he wins every time.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:49.300]   But the point is that you can be competitive during play
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.260]   provided that you were enjoying yourself, okay?
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:53.380]   You can be competitive
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.020]   provided that you were enjoying yourself.
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.500]   There are particular forms of play
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.860]   that lend themselves best to neuroplasticity.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:04.600]   And those particular forms of play, again,
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.820]   are not designed to necessarily just engage the plasticity
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.980]   that allows you to perform that behavior,
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.220]   but rather to expand the number of possibilities
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:16.540]   for your brain to change in general throughout life.
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.020]   And the two major forms of those
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.260]   for which there's good peer-reviewed research
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:24.660]   is to engage in novel forms of movement
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:27.140]   including different speeds of movement.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.900]   So let's say for instance, you're somebody who runs.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:30.860]   I happen to like running.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.120]   I try and run three times a week.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.440]   And generally when I run, I run forward.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.040]   I don't run backward although recently
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.540]   because I've become very excited
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.300]   about the work of so-called knees over toes guy.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.980]   His name is Ben Parker,
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.700]   but he goes by knees over toes guy on Instagram.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.540]   I've never met him,
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:49.140]   but we've exchanged a few messages back and forth.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:53.180]   And some of his practices involve walking backwards
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.540]   or doing sled pulls backwards.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.800]   I found these to be very beneficial for my back
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.260]   and for my anterior tibialis
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.740]   and some things that have really helped
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.960]   with my posture and so forth.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.580]   But in general, when I run, I run forward.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.340]   I don't tend to run backward that much.
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.140]   And I might do that for a few minutes at the end,
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.620]   but not so much throughout the entire run.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.580]   Running doesn't lend itself to a lot of novel forms
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:17.180]   of movement, lateral movements.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.780]   So for you nerds out there,
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:22.540]   the movement in the sagittal plane or angled movements,
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.740]   but it does appear that things like dance or sports,
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.140]   where you end up generating a lot of dynamic movements,
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.100]   where there's jumping,
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.060]   where there's movement at different angles,
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.340]   where there's ducking, where there's leaping,
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.920]   that basically involve a lot of dynamic movement
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.100]   and aren't just strictly linear.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:42.640]   Those seem to open the portals for plasticity.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.400]   And that's because they mimic a lot of the brain circuitry
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.520]   that is associated with play.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.940]   And the reason for that is the way
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.480]   in which those dynamic movements
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.360]   and movements of different speeds
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.960]   engage the vestibular system, the balance system.
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   The vestibular system is in the inner ear,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.740]   relates to the cerebellum, which translate to mini brain.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.560]   You got a little mini brain in the back of your brain.
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.240]   It brings together visual information in a very direct way.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.160]   I talked a lot about this in the episode
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.580]   on how to learn faster.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.080]   So if you want to go in depth on how vestibular
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.400]   and different types of motor movements can open plasticity,
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.240]   I talk a little bit more, I should say a lot more there,
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.980]   but suffice to say that engaging in play
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.340]   that has a lot of dynamic movement
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.500]   or movements of different speeds, things like dance,
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.800]   things like sports, like soccer,
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.960]   where you're moving in different dimensions,
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.980]   that tends to be very conducive
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.320]   to what we would call play-related circuitry,
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.560]   provided you don't take it too seriously.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.920]   You don't get those high levels of epinephrine.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.500]   Now, for those of you that are also interested
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.580]   in non-physical or non-athletic forms of play
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:46.060]   that can really expand plasticity,
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.500]   there's some very interesting research
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.260]   about the game of chess.
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.800]   I don't play the game of chess.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.900]   I've played a few times.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.900]   I confess I don't know how to move all the pieces,
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.740]   so I'm not going to try and describe that here,
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.980]   but I've always wanted to learn chess.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.340]   And I think after reading some of the peer reviewed research
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.400]   about chess and play in neuroplasticity,
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.880]   now I understand why.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.500]   There's a really nice paper that was published
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.140]   in the International Journal of Research
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.860]   and Education and Science in 2017.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.100]   And the title of this paper is,
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.980]   is chess just a game or is it a mirror
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.280]   that reflects a child's inner world?
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.620]   That's a very intense title for a biologist like me.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.780]   But this paper is so interesting
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.480]   because what it really points to is the fact
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.540]   that in a single game chess,
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.460]   you have, at least as I understand, two players,
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:36.380]   and those two players are moving pieces on the chess board
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.400]   for which each piece can do different things, right?
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.520]   Can move in different ways under different scenarios,
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.260]   but there are different rules for different pieces.
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.580]   And so each player actually has to assume
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.700]   multiple identities during the same game.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.140]   And each of those identities has different rules
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.520]   and ways of interacting.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.340]   So in a way we can think of chess as one game,
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:00.460]   but actually chess is a kind of a substrate
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.780]   for exploring multiple roles for different characters.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:06.020]   And this is quite a bit different than, for instance,
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:08.420]   video games where somebody has their favorite
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.860]   video game player, or they have an avatar,
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.300]   and they're always in the same role.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.620]   It's also quite a bit different
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.460]   for when you engage in any kind of play
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:18.620]   where you are yourself, you're just being you in that game.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.760]   And so now I'm highly incentivized to explore chess.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.500]   You see quotes out there, for instance,
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.060]   things like chess is life or jujitsu is life.
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.500]   I always assumed that that meant
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.500]   that someone's entire life was chess
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.020]   or their entire life was jujitsu, for instance.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:40.900]   But in reading over the research about chess in particular,
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.740]   but also certain forms of martial arts,
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.240]   also certain forms of dance,
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.500]   what one finds is that indeed those games are life
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:52.900]   in the sense that they involve adopting multiple roles
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:55.660]   and exploring contingencies in a number of different ways.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.500]   So there are some games that allow you to explore
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:02.540]   a much vaster landscape of movements or of mental roles
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:05.580]   or of ways of engaging in strategic movement
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.300]   as is the case with chess.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:11.460]   And so when you hear that activity blank is life,
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.020]   it often reflects the passion for that activity,
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:15.500]   but I think looked at differently,
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.620]   it also reflects the fact that that activity
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.460]   is a portal through which you can explore life
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:24.140]   through many, many different lenses.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:26.820]   And I think that that's especially powerful
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.300]   in terms of thinking about how play
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.940]   can be leveraged for plasticity.
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.060]   So for those of you that are interested
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.040]   in leveraging play for neuroplasticity
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.680]   and expanding your mind, if you will,
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.180]   I highly recommend picking an activity
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:42.800]   that will allow you to adopt different roles
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.640]   within that activity, where it's not rigidly linear.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.080]   This is actually a way in which I start to depart
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:53.820]   from this modern and important, but somewhat narrow idea
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.420]   that exercise is the only route to plasticity.
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.380]   Yes, it's true.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.660]   I have Nobel prize winning colleagues
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.660]   that swim for two miles a day
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.040]   and have done that for a long time.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:04.900]   And they will tell you,
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.060]   I always think more clearly after my swimming.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:09.660]   And I certainly, in my experience,
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.240]   after a good run or a good workout,
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.620]   my mind seems to work best,
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.780]   unless of course that workout was very, very intense.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.820]   I've talked about this before.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.140]   If you do work out very, very hard
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.300]   in whether or not it's aerobic or resistance training
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.320]   or sport of any kind,
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.380]   your brain won't function as well afterwards,
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.540]   mostly because of the diversion of oxygen
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:29.860]   to tissues away from your brain.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.840]   You actually are getting less oxygen to your brain.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:32.980]   But in general, most of us feel
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:36.100]   that if we exercise regularly, our brain functions better.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:39.900]   But there are activities that extend beyond linear exercise,
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:43.020]   beyond just generating the same sets of movements
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.380]   over and over again, whether or not it's exercise or not.
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.340]   And that's really what play is.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:50.220]   Play is about dynamically exploring
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.200]   different kinds of movements,
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.560]   dynamically exploring different kinds of thoughts,
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.760]   dynamically exploring different kinds of roles
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.400]   that one could adopt.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.560]   And that is the way that the brain learns new things.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.580]   So I encourage you to explore chess.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.940]   I intend to learn chess this year.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.320]   I'm very excited to do that.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.160]   Now, if you already play chess
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.040]   and you are an expert chess player,
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.820]   you actually will derive less benefit
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.940]   in terms of this play-induced neuroplasticity
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:18.160]   than you would, for instance,
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.100]   if you went out and, I don't know,
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.520]   played a game of soccer or did something
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.600]   that was very novel for your nervous system,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.860]   because in that novelty and in that exploration
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:29.740]   of new behaviors and new ways of thinking,
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.980]   you are opening the portal to plasticity.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.140]   Whereas in doing what you already know how to do
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.100]   and trying just to perform better and better at it,
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.740]   you will get better at chess.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.760]   But again, that's just chess.
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:42.780]   You are not expanding the realms
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.960]   in which you can become more plastic,
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.420]   that you are able to learn new things in relationship,
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.000]   in life, in finance, in friendship, et cetera.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.500]   In researching this episode,
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.240]   one of the most interesting areas I discovered
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.440]   was this notion of personal play identity.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.020]   Personal play identity is a term that,
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:02.980]   at least to my knowledge,
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.920]   was coined by a Turkish researcher by the name,
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.020]   and forgive me, I'm going to mispronounce this,
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:14.020]   is Gokhan Gunes, G-O-K-H-A-N,
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.500]   last name, G-U-N-E-S.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.000]   And forgive me, Gokhan,
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.380]   and if we have any Turkish-speaking members of the audience,
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:26.220]   please put the correction in the comment section on YouTube
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.980]   and make it phonetic so I can understand what it is.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:30.320]   Please, I'd love to correct it,
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.460]   and apologies, or who knows?
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.700]   If I got it right, then it was pure luck.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:39.660]   Gokhan Gunes has coined this term personal play identity,
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:44.660]   and the key role that personal play identity establishes
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:48.380]   in who we see ourselves as being,
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:50.540]   and not just in the context of play.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:54.460]   Personal play identity has four well-defined dimensions.
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.780]   And I should say that if you're interested
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:56.840]   in learning more about this,
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.540]   the paper that I found particularly informative
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.180]   is published in Current Psychology,
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.100]   and the title is Personal Play Identity
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:09.260]   and the Fundamental Elements in its Developmental Process.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.060]   And the author, of course, is Gokhan Gunes,
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.740]   G-U-N-E-S, last name.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:15.080]   This is from 2021, so recent review.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.100]   There are four components to personal play identity.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:23.700]   How you play, your personality,
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:27.680]   socioculture and environment,
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.220]   so that's the third one that's together,
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.600]   socioculture and environment,
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.840]   and economics and technology.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.460]   Now, that sounds somewhat complex,
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:35.920]   and this paper is somewhat complex,
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.980]   but basically what it says is that
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:42.380]   we bring together certain aspects of ourselves
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.180]   and how we react to different play scenarios
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.020]   when we're younger,
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.380]   and we bring that forward into the world
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:50.680]   in all contexts as adults.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.720]   To illustrate this, I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.000]   When you were a child, let's say 10 years old,
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.320]   would you have considered yourself competitive?
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.800]   Would you have considered yourself
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.020]   somebody who's cooperative and realize, of course,
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.960]   that those are not mutually exclusive?
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.980]   You could be competitive and cooperative.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.600]   Would you consider yourself somebody
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.580]   that preferred to play alone
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:15.640]   or preferred to play with one or two close friends?
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.860]   Or were you somebody that really enjoyed
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.360]   playing in large groups?
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.560]   Here's a key one.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.080]   Were you somebody that enjoyed
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.060]   playing the leader in one moment
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:29.540]   and was equally okay with being a follower
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.980]   at a later moment?
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:33.340]   Were you okay with having your role switched
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.180]   midway through a game?
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:38.540]   Would you get upset or be delighted
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.180]   or not care at all about having to switch teams
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.020]   during the middle of a game
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:45.580]   because your team was winning to even things out?
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.700]   You can imagine how that would play out internally.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.020]   You would immediately register
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.380]   that you must be a valuable player
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:53.080]   because you're being moved off the winning team
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.280]   toward the losing team.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.960]   But then again, you're now being forced
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.160]   to join the losing team.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.240]   How did you feel about that?
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.960]   Were you somebody that was comfortable
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.420]   with other people breaking rules
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:09.100]   or perhaps even yourself breaking rules or bending rules?
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.640]   Kind of be able to find term.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.080]   Or were you somebody that really needed
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.040]   to know all the rules
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.400]   and if everyone didn't rigidly adhere to those rules
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.540]   was quite disturbed by that?
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.740]   The number of questions goes on and on and on.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.340]   And I will provide a link to a paper
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:26.580]   that asks a number of questions
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.900]   that helps you arrive at a sort of score of sorts
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:33.060]   or an index of what Gunes and others
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.620]   have referred to as personal play identity.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:39.500]   The point is that if we look back to our early adolescence,
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.500]   somewhere between 10 and 14 years old,
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.180]   a peak time for social development,
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:48.180]   a peak time for play of various kinds,
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:50.660]   a peak time for motor development,
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:54.060]   a peak time of psychosocial development,
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:56.320]   where we learn where we fit into hierarchies
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.760]   as we relate to members of the same sex,
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.360]   of the opposite sex, et cetera,
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.100]   we can start to get a portal into how and why we show up
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.860]   to various activities in work and relationship,
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.920]   et cetera, as adults.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.220]   In fact, I'll venture to say
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:14.620]   that if we go into that process for ourselves
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:15.860]   for five or 10 minutes,
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.060]   you start to see some remarkable parallels
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.380]   between the way you were at that stage
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:24.080]   and your tendencies and your preferences as adults.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.820]   We tend to look at our early childhood experiences
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.420]   and our families, and to some degree, our friends,
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:32.840]   in terms of how we become who we become.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.820]   I've talked about the incredible work of Alan Shore
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.760]   on previous episodes of the podcast.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.100]   Alan Shore is a psychiatrist and has done extensive work
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.460]   on how parent-child interactions,
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:49.440]   in particular baby and mother, but also baby and father,
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.400]   shape the brain and the brain and emotional system's ability
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.160]   to go from states of elation and excitement,
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.720]   the so-called dopamine epinephrine type circuitry,
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.000]   to the more warm, soothing types of calm interactions
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.280]   that in broad terms could be described as more serotonin,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.180]   oxytocin, and things of that sort.
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.640]   That work really points to the key roles
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.460]   that the caregiver and the child, you,
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.300]   engaged in in early life.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.880]   And that is incredible work.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:23.140]   I do hope to host Dr. Shore on the podcast
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:25.980]   at some point in the not too distant future.
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:28.120]   But equally important, of course,
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.360]   are the interactions that we export
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.940]   from that early laying down of biological circuitry
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:38.320]   and psychological circuitry to the way we play by ourselves
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.020]   and the way we play with others,
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:43.240]   in small numbers or in great numbers.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.680]   And of course it would be the case
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:48.560]   that how we played as a 10 or 12-year-old
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.040]   would impact how we behave as a 16-year-old
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.240]   and as a 20-year-old and as a 30-year-old
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:55.440]   and so on and so on.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.220]   One of my favorite things about developmental biology
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:00.940]   and developmental psychology is that it is grounded
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:03.040]   in the fact that we don't just have a childhood
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.380]   and an adulthood.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:07.080]   There isn't just our child self and our adult self.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.820]   And even though there are transitions around the mechanisms
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.360]   that underlie neuroplasticity at approximately age 25,
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.420]   it is simply the case that development
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:19.000]   is our entire lifespan,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.540]   that our lifespan is one long developmental arc.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.860]   How long depends on our genetics, our lifestyle,
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.680]   accidents, injury, and disease, of course,
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.560]   but it is one long developmental arc.
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.280]   And so it shouldn't surprise us at all
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.100]   that how we learn to play as a 10-year-old or 12-year-old
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:39.040]   would impact how we play and interact with people
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.360]   as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.680]   And that play is the place in which we explore
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.060]   and which we learn.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.860]   Play is the substrate by which our nervous system
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:55.540]   changes us from this hyper-connected batch of neurons
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:58.900]   where everything is connected to everything, more or less,
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:03.400]   to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.400]   work with immense proficiency
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.800]   and others are less accessible to us.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.120]   But again, the wonderful thing about the human nervous system
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.120]   is that because it is plastic for the entire lifespan,
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:19.300]   and because these two elements of focus and rest
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.960]   can be deployed again and again and again,
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.960]   just because neural circuits didn't form
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.960]   does not mean that they can't form later in life.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.000]   And today we've been focusing on how play itself,
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.340]   the same substrate that we use during development
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.940]   to become who we are,
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.500]   is the portal by which we can change who we are
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.520]   for the better.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.440]   So I hope I've convinced you that play is an extremely
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:45.200]   important fundamental homeostatically regulated aspect
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.360]   of our nervous system,
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.060]   which is just a mouthful of nerd speak to say,
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.560]   play can change your brain for the better.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.240]   And that is true for every stage of life.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.060]   The recommendation that I make,
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.720]   and certainly the one that I'm going to direct it myself
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:04.300]   as well, is to try and engage in at least one hour
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.600]   of pure play per week.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.960]   Now I came to that recommendation because of the literature
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.680]   that says, well,
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.360]   you need to engage in something pretty repetitively.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.560]   It should be novel.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.700]   So this wouldn't be something that you are exceptionally
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.400]   good at already.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.900]   If you insist on doing something that you're already
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:23.080]   exceptionally good at,
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.860]   then you want to really do some free form,
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.560]   low stakes tinkering.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.760]   So make it safe, but make it free form.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.760]   So really explore things with that.
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.480]   Some people call this beginner's mind.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.060]   Although I find that a little abstract.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:37.420]   I like the notion of beginner's mind,
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.260]   but it's sort of like,
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.660]   how do you know if you're in beginner's mind?
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.960]   I think beginner's mind is sort of the expectation
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.240]   that you're not going to do it well yet,
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.120]   but play extends beyond beginner's mind.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.240]   Play is really about not even worrying
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.120]   if you're going to get good at it or really proficient at it.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.720]   It's really about exploring contingencies
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.240]   with truly low stakes.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.960]   That's what will allow you to access
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.000]   these neurochemical combinations
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.160]   of elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera,
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.560]   that will open up neuroplasticity.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.360]   For those of you that need a little more guidance
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:10.080]   on how to play, there's a book out there.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.560]   I actually learned about this from Tim Ferriss' blog.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.780]   It's called "Play It Away, A Workaholic's Cure for Anxiety."
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:17.140]   So that's more focused on anxiety.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:22.140]   The author is Charlie Hone, last name H-O-E-H-N.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:24.280]   We'll provide a link for it in the show notes and caption.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:27.620]   "Play It Away, A Workaholic's Cure for Anxiety."
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:30.920]   But books and other resources aside,
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.820]   I think one hour of play per week
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:34.960]   is a reasonable amount of time
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.760]   to engage in dedicated play behavior
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.860]   for the purpose of opening up
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:42.440]   these neural circuits for plasticity.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.540]   The key feature, of course,
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:47.200]   is to not have immense proficiency in that given activity,
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.040]   or at least not the way you perform it.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:52.280]   And if you do gain proficiency in that activity,
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.600]   well, then it becomes something else.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.600]   It's no longer about play, it's about performance.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.520]   So in that case,
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.700]   you would then want to adopt a new play behavior.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.320]   You'll notice that I largely avoided
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.040]   using the word fun throughout this episode.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.880]   Fun is a somewhat abstract term,
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.120]   and like many emotions
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.440]   and many verbal descriptions of experience,
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.760]   it falls short in the context
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.880]   of a neurobiological discussion about play.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.640]   If you have fun, terrific.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.260]   Some people might find, however,
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:23.740]   that engaging in play is kind of uncomfortable.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:24.800]   Well, there your goal then
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.920]   should be to lower your level of discomfort
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.960]   by focusing less on the outcomes
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:31.020]   and just simply engaging in the behavior
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:34.040]   because, well, I'm telling you that it's good for you,
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.500]   but hopefully you will tell yourself
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:36.340]   that it's good for you
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:39.620]   and that you will experience that it's good for you.
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:41.700]   The literature certainly points to that,
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:44.360]   and the literature certainly points to the fact
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.760]   that play is the way that we are built.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.620]   We are built to play.
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:51.780]   We have brain circuits from back to front
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.160]   and within our body that are there for play,
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.280]   and they don't disappear.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:57.180]   They do not get pruned away
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.200]   as we go from development to adulthood.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.040]   So if ever you needed a neurobiological explanation
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:05.880]   for why play is important throughout the lifespan, it's that.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:08.700]   It's that biology does not waste resources.
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:10.280]   It's extremely efficient.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.060]   And were the circuits for play
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.800]   not to be important in adulthood,
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.080]   they would have been pruned away,
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.660]   but I guarantee you they are there
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.720]   in your brain and nervous system now.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.720]   They will be there tomorrow,
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.320]   and they will be there going forward.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:25.940]   So my suggestion is that you use them one hour per week.
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:28.480]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.660]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.100]   We also have a Patreon.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:02.200]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.820]   and there you can support the podcast
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:05.820]   at any level that you like.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.460]   If you're not already following us on Twitter and Instagram,
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:09.880]   we are @hubermanlab on Twitter
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:12.680]   and also @hubermanlab on Instagram.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.360]   On Instagram, I do short posts
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.940]   that are related to topics covered on the podcast,
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.600]   but also some additional topics.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.840]   So these would include science-based tools
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.960]   for things like focus, for sleep, for learning,
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.840]   and many other topics as well.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.520]   In previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.380]   we often refer to supplements.
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.520]   Now, supplements aren't necessary or correct for everybody,
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:36.100]   but many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:39.040]   for things like sleep and focus and so on.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.100]   We've partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-I-N-E,
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.900]   because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.580]   in terms of the ingredients they use
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.740]   and the specificity of the amounts of the ingredients
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.020]   that are listed on the bottle
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.380]   are actually what is in those bottles,
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:56.240]   which is not the case for many supplement brands out there.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.220]   If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:02.000]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000]   So that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.680]   And those supplements you can purchase at 20% off.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:13.060]   And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.920]   through that URL portal,
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.600]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   that Thorne makes.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.120]   Thank you once again for joining me for this discussion
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:23.700]   about the incredible biology and psychology
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:26.620]   and power of this thing that we call play.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.860]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:30.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:33.200]   [upbeat music]
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.800]   (upbeat music)
