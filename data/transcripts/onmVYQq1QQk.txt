[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020]   We open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with one big huge or love you bet a queen of Kinwam
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.520]   I
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.680]   Cannot believe what Jake has pulled off here
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   We are witnessing our first Theranos moment. I got great news. I took all the money I put in Luna
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.180]   From an undisclosed location. Mr. Elon Musk
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.700]   People actually fucking listen to us talking over Zoom. This is like way more work than I thought I was signing up for
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.300]   I
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.880]   Want to talk about a lot of stuff that's broken right now that we know how to fix but we aren't
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.240]   Bad customer service and health care the defense industry in America is fundamentally broken
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.480]   There's no doubt that it's a left-wing monoculture that's suppressing ideas and someone needs to fix that that these
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.600]   Prestige outlets like the New York Times have so much credibility in our culture
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.620]   They have the power to destroy people's careers what went wrong that this would happen
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000]   Journalism has adjusted. We've gone from being
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.460]   people whose primary job is to be curious about why things happen to being
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.920]   Advocates a government shouldn't be running a hundred billion dollar surplus. It's not a for-profit organization. No
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.380]   That means something is wrong. The obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed more money than it had
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.080]   Because so many people just want a yes-or-no answer. They want to say this is the future this isn't they don't want to think
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.580]   About a distribution of outcomes, which is really the way the world works. Let me just start by saying that investing is really fucking hard
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580]   [Applause]
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:59.780]   So we get to approach these problems but often the solution is east meets west
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.060]   For women to believe in themselves
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.180]   We make amazing founders people who are true
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.400]   Entrepreneurs and think at scale and think and think very very big
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.340]   We're very much into freedom here in Miami and we try to facilitate people's growth and success. That's it
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.340]   That's all we do. I think sometimes
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.580]   We have to think very deeply about
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.300]   The suffering people have had especially when it's different than the suffering that you and I have had
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.540]   Yeah, if you remember your physics velocity has a direction and sometimes going really really fast is actually negative velocity because you're going the wrong way
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.180]   I mean I get trashed by the media all the time. It's fine
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.580]   I don't care but it's indicative of the fact that even though I have like a lot of resources
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.220]   I do not actually have the ability to stop the media from trashing me and that's actually a good thing
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.500]   Well, you just broke the fucking internet with Elon. He was in a great mood. Yeah, I was
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.980]   He likes hanging with his besties like say when does prestige matter most?
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.460]   It's when someone you don't like saying something you don't like what drives the country forward
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.420]   This is what drives knowledge forward is people able to disagree. Russia isn't aggressive because it's surrounded by NATO
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.980]   It's surrounded by NATO because it's aggressive but to sacrifice Ukraine in pursuit of this broader geopolitical for him
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.300]   It was a game. It was his show and for me, of course, I'm a jerk. I'm not a coward
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.560]   You're gonna take me on straight up as a man. I appreciate it
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.060]   You just kind of have to say like fuck you and move on with your life
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.780]   If you're sitting on excess liquidity right now and want to invest for a long
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.740]   Was that a transition from war 3 -
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:38.300]   The best way to protect yourself against the downside is to enjoy every last bit of the upside and now we have inflation
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.220]   But we also have lots of business formation and we have a new ways of doing work
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.540]   The trends that existed for 20 years
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.500]   Still exist that inflation will roll over so I'm willing to underwrite to that
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.260]   There is going to be a big beautiful bull market in real stuff and it is just beginning
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.900]   Best entrepreneurs are incredible storytellers as a way of attracting the best talent and then as a way of attracting customers
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:19.340]   And I don't want to die without having used whatever influence I have to proselytize for ideas
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.240]   I believe it you need strong leadership companies are there to make products that people and organizations want to need not
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.740]   Necessarily to fight over political ideals the world's never gonna run out of new ideas for business software
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.340]   And there will always be an opportunity there for new companies
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.100]   But we cannot debate is how important it is that the United States win and that democracy wins and that freedom comes to all
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.100]   these countries
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.100]   You
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.100]   You
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.260]   Thank you
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   You
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260]   (audience applauds)
