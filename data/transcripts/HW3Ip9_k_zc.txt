[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   Well, Megyn Kelly looks to be parting ways with NBC.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.240]   Her show is now canceled.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.580]   - Megyn Kelly just landed a new gig.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.120]   - Why was she given a platform in the first place?
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.080]   - We're doing this program because we believe
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.960]   there's an urgent need for independent voices
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.420]   in the media landscape.
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.260]   - I know the audience you have.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.880]   I can reasonably guess it.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.840]   It's enormous.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.340]   Podcasts, Rumble, YouTube, Twitter with Elon,
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.600]   that's the problem.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.320]   A lot of people in cable news, Megyn,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.320]   are fighting yesterday's war.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.240]   They're not the problem now, you're the problem.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.860]   - Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Megyn Kelly.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160]   (audience applause)
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.360]   Good, great to see you.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.400]   Thank you for coming.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.280]   Hi, thanks for being here.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.360]   - All right.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.320]   - Hi Megyn, how are you?
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.440]   Nice to see you.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.700]   - Hey Megyn, how are you?
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.120]   - Did you get to hear Peter Thiel, Megyn?
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.280]   - I did, just the tail end, just a bit.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.820]   - What do you think of Peter?
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.900]   - He's brilliant.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.740]   - Yeah?
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.580]   - Yeah, I mean, thank God for him, right?
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.780]   It's like there's a few guys in tech with a lot of money
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.360]   keeping Republican candidates alive
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   and we need every single one of them.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.080]   (audience laughter)
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   - Okay, thank God we're starting early.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.200]   - I think all of them were here today.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   (audience laughter)
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.080]   - You seem incredibly happy as an independent broadcaster
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.660]   and running your own show.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.660]   Maybe, number one, am I right that you're
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.620]   just absolutely engaged and excited again
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.500]   about broadcasting because it seemed like
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.320]   the tail end of your working for the machine
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.740]   was particularly challenging?
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.580]   - Oh yeah.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.420]   - Tell us.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.320]   - That's a polite way of saying it.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.160]   - I'm just trying to be polite, yeah.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.240]   - No, it's fine.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.080]   You are?
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.920]   - Well, the last time it kind of blew up on us.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   - Remember when you called him a prick on TV?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   - I do, I do.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.880]   (laughter)
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.380]   It was good natured.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.800]   - It was good natured, yes.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.780]   - Yeah, no, I'm so much happier.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.320]   And it's really changed my whole view on cancel culture.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.160]   I really, I'm a believer in cancel culture now.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.040]   I think it separates individuals from companies
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.820]   where they do not belong, where the values are not aligned.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.820]   And I really can't imagine being right now at NBC,
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.840]   or frankly at Fox News, in this environment
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.920]   and having to comport with their rules
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.120]   on how we talk about these very dicey issues
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   that are all over the news today.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.160]   I could not do it.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.540]   It was just a matter of time before I was canceled.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.800]   - Yeah, talk about producing a show now
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.380]   that is the largest, you're now the largest broadcaster
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.680]   in the news category on YouTube, crushing everybody else.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.260]   CNN, Fox, their YouTube channels now bow down before you,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.640]   and you are an independent company
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.680]   with, I understand, six people.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.140]   - Yeah, six producers.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.740]   - Six producers.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.900]   So that is, how many people at the peak, NBC, Fox,
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.060]   did you have working in your group?
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.320]   - Well, I probably had about 15 producers,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.400]   but Fox was always lean.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.600]   CNN, Anderson Cooper Show, which was across from us
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.560]   for a while, minus one hour,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.440]   had something like 100 staffers.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.280]   So think about it.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.620]   So we did not, in July, we did not beat CNN,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.880]   but we had 2/3 of CNN's YouTube audience, 2/3.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.320]   Every single dollar in the multibillion-dollar CNN audience
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.860]   went into, obviously, their live broadcasts, which we crush.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.840]   We crush their numbers, dollar to dollar,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.880]   in terms of the podcasts and so on.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.600]   But let's just look at YouTube.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.800]   So all those resources go into their YouTube feed as well,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.320]   and it's got every show on CNN, every single talent.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.680]   And our one show, with my six producers,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.720]   crushed, well, came close to crushing them all,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   and did crush CBS and NBC,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.220]   which was a particularly nice piece of news.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.960]   (audience laughs and applauds)
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.280]   - When you left, my understanding of these deals,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.940]   when Tucker left on Lemon,
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.560]   and you leave those broadcast ones,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.640]   it's kind of like they're paying you to not compete.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.840]   You can't go work for another network.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.200]   So was that the case with you, if you can say it,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.800]   and then you were kind of forced
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.720]   to become an independent broadcaster?
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.740]   - I wasn't forced.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.760]   I was only forced to have my show end at NBC.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.640]   And beyond that, I don't think I'm at liberty
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   to speak of the specifics. - Got it.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.100]   - But I was free to get another job.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.600]   I just wasn't sure I would.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.220]   There was a couple of years there
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.100]   that were dark and depressing,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.720]   and my industry is incredibly disgusting and toxic
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.800]   and awful.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.040]   Perhaps you've watched the news and you know.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.640]   And I just sat on the couch thinking,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   why would I go back into that?
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.840]   That was terrible.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.080]   And it makes you a bad person and unhappy.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.400]   And all they do is stimulate outrage all the time
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   and then get rich off of it.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.760]   And you have to push somebody else's agenda.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.880]   And I don't wanna do any of that.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.280]   And it wasn't until first the pandemic hit,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.000]   and then we started to lose our minds on all the mandates,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.800]   and then George Floyd, and then we really lost our minds.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   And seeing those people in the streets
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.240]   trying to make people put down their burgers
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.920]   and say Black Lives Matter is when I got up off my couch
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.080]   and said, now it's on.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520]   Like, I can't stand when people make me do things.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.560]   I really, I can't stand bullies.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.880]   And it's in my DNA to stand up against them.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.000]   And so I had to get back on the air.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I said to my therapist, who is really underpaid,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.920]   (both laughing)
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.320]   what if nobody watches?
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.960]   You know, what if nobody listens?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.480]   It was just a podcast at the time, no visual.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   And he's from South Africa, and he said, well, I'll listen.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.920]   I said, okay, great.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.160]   And Doug will listen, my husband.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.040]   I'm like, well, I've got two.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.640]   And that was four years ago, and now it's going great.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.560]   - How has your approach changed, if at all,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.000]   in terms of what you want to produce
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.320]   and what conversations you want to have?
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.920]   Because you no longer have to think,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.280]   well, what does Roger Ailes think,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.640]   or this NBC person, or everybody in between.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   You actually, the buck stops at your desk,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.320]   at your microphone, you're the decider now.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.080]   So what is your framework for deciding what to put on air?
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.640]   Because you do also now suffer from,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.560]   hey, you're in YouTube.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.120]   If it bleeds, it leads.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.640]   If it has rage associated with it,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   it's gonna get more clicks.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.160]   So how do you mitigate that?
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.800]   - Well, I love my producers,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.720]   and a few of them have been with me for over 10 years,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.960]   15 years plus, from Fox News,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.280]   from the earliest show I ever did in 2007 to now.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.200]   So they know me very well,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.680]   and they know what lights my fire.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.640]   And if I feel that fire in the belly,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.960]   it's usually not outrage,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.080]   it's just fire in the belly over the news,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.760]   then it's a good story for me.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.440]   And that differs host to host.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.880]   You know, what drives you nuts?
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.120]   What do you need to have your say on?
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.480]   And so for me, speaking of therapists,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.120]   it's like therapy to go out there on the set
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.160]   and say what I know is true, right?
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.760]   Just say what's true about the news.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.680]   And then we can argue about the meaning
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.440]   and our opinions on what's true,
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.080]   but what's true should not be so up for debate.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.120]   But yeah, I have a few through lines
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.920]   that my team always knows will get me excited.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.120]   And since the beginning, free speech has been one of them.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.440]   And the thing about the cops,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   it's not coincidental that that's what got me up,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.960]   because I've been at Fox, you know, 14 years I was there,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   and I have a brother who's a police officer,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.600]   he's a retired lieutenant,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.960]   and one of the most honorable men
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.880]   you'll ever meet in your life.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.520]   And I am just so sick and have been so sick
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.600]   of the lies that have been told about cops.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   - It's brutal.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.240]   We have law enforcement in my family as well,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.080]   and it's really hard to watch this, yeah.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.400]   - Yes, it's so egregious.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.160]   This is not to excuse the few bad apples
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.000]   that you see on the news,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.680]   but they are so not representative
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.040]   of your average police officer.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.880]   - Absolutely not.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.040]   - And it's, these guys make no money.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.000]   You know, they don't get a lot of glory.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.840]   - They risk their lives.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.720]   - They risk their lives every day for us, right?
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.280]   And now on top of all that,
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.000]   they're treated like absolute shit by everyone.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.800]   The news media, absolutely no qualms
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.600]   about ruining these guys' lives before any due process.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.200]   And that's what the media's been doing
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.000]   with everyone in the past five years.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.480]   No due process.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.600]   You are, you're accused of anything, you're guilty.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.760]   And there's really no Jones
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.920]   to figure out whether it's fair.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.640]   And so, you know, given my legal background,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.360]   'cause I practiced law for a decade,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   that's another piece of it that always gets me fired up,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.920]   somebody being unfairly railroaded.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   - I think the topic you've been most on fire,
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.300]   and I think it's very brave,
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.400]   is the issues around trans issues, trans rights,
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.440]   and maybe young children.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.680]   You're not a bigot, but you're being framed as that
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.040]   when this discussion comes up.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.240]   Maybe you could explain just what is your position
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   on biological men in locker rooms, you know,
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.720]   and maybe kids receiving hormones
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.840]   or having their bodies mutilated
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.040]   because they maybe feel like they're the opposite gender.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.380]   I don't wanna lead the witness here,
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.480]   but I think we're more in sync on this issue
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.320]   than maybe most.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.720]   - Yeah, I don't care what they call me.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.360]   They can call me a bigot, a TERF, a trans misogynist,
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.640]   which is not a thing, I will speak truth.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.320]   Men cannot become women, period.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.400]   Women can't become men either.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.000]   And men and boys do not belong in women's spaces,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   whether it's a bathroom, a locker room,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.880]   or a sports event.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   They don't.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.200]   And good men do not wish to access those places.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.720]   And by the way, even if you have some empathy
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.280]   for someone who's genuinely struggling,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.160]   the problem is the camel's nose,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.680]   because as soon as you allow one person
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.720]   who may be genuinely struggling with this issue
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.180]   into your 17-year-old girl's locker room,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.500]   that opportunity will be exploited by openly bad actors.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.700]   And when girls start getting hurt in these private spaces,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.820]   as they already have been,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.380]   listen to Riley Gaines's testimonial
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.140]   about what happened to her with Leah Thomas,
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.940]   about how he was in there, he was looking at her,
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.580]   she was naked, she had no idea an intact male
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.300]   was entering her locker room, the humiliation she felt.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.380]   That counts as injury, but we could go well beyond that
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.540]   because it's crossed over to actual physical.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.740]   So I am willing to fight to my dying day against that
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.300]   without judging trans people themselves.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.900]   What you do in the privacy of your own home
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.860]   or your own life is your business, not mine,
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.620]   unless you make it my business.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.700]   And then you will hear from me.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.980]   And if you make it my child's business, times 10.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.980]   - And in your answer is empathy for somebody
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.820]   who is suffering from gender dysmorphia
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.940]   and who's struggling with that issue,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.460]   and you don't have a problem with those individuals,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.100]   as you've said two or three times in that one answer.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.740]   Yet you could give that disclaimer,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.540]   you could say you have empathy or sympathy for them,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.100]   and the only thing they're gonna hear
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.860]   is something they project into it.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.780]   - So it got a lot easier for me on the name calling
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.940]   in response to this issue once I realized
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.460]   the vast majority of people who wanna call me a bigot
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.260]   or a TERF are men, they are men posing as women.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.220]   So these are men trying to shame me
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.540]   out of standing up for my daughter and myself
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.420]   and my fellow women on our safe spaces.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.380]   That's the end of it.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.860]   They can take a seat.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.380]   Because these men don't know the first thing,
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.700]   they're showing up for mammograms.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.540]   You ladies know what it's like, the older ones like me,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.820]   sitting in the mammogram office
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.100]   where you're out there waiting to go in
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.980]   and you're in your little robe and you're worried,
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.540]   you're nervous, you gotta do it when you hit a certain age.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.180]   But you know what you're there for,
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.060]   you guys have it on the other end.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.540]   You're like, I hope I don't have cancer,
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.660]   they say I need to go here, I gotta find it early.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.140]   You're sitting looking at other women
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.940]   and now we're having men.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.380]   Men sneak in there, not because they're actually worried
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.860]   'cause a very, very small percentage can get,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.900]   but because they wanna feel like women.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.820]   Same thing at the OBGYN, get out.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.340]   Get out of our spaces, I'm sick of this bullshit.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.740]   Now what I have empathy for is us, women and girls.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.300]   Somebody else can worry about the feelings
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.780]   of the men who wanna access.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.540]   (audience applauding)
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.380]   - Can I?
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.460]   Do you think that there are individuals
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.900]   who have been historically repressed
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.020]   and have now felt the freedom to come out
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.980]   and say that they are a different gender?
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.580]   Or do you think that there's something else
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.980]   socially going on?
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.300]   What's going on and why do you think
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.700]   that this has become such a prominent issue
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.460]   of late in the last couple of years?
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.620]   - Yes, 100% it has exploded as a social contagion.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.820]   And that's been documented by many people
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.500]   from a very smart woman at Brown to Abigail Shrier
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.940]   in her must-read book "Irreversible Damage" and beyond.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.500]   But this is a social contagion.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.260]   This is not populating in the way that it is
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.740]   just because we're more accepting now.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.660]   And if that were true, you would see it everywhere.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.460]   But what you're seeing is more concentrated
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.020]   in more leftist states, cities, regions.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.900]   And that's because the more of it kids are exposed to,
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.700]   the more they gravitate toward it.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.380]   And in that way, it is like anorexia.
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.860]   I just had Kelly J. Keane in a pre-taped show today.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.940]   She's airing tomorrow.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.740]   She's an activist on this issue.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.260]   And she was saying, if you go on YouTube
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.820]   and you Google anorexia or bulimia,
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.300]   they won't show you the videos.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.740]   But if you Google top surgery,
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.180]   which is the super sweet way of saying a double mastectomy,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.820]   usually for 15 or 14-year-old girls,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.460]   you can see all you want all day long.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.980]   And what's happening more and more is autistic children
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.380]   or children someplace on the spectrum stumble onto this
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.380]   and in many cases have obsessive thinking to begin with
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.100]   and go down a rabbit hole that takes them hours on end
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.140]   down Reddit or one of these other websites.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.140]   And it does become an obsessive thought
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.660]   and then obsessive behavior.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.620]   And then you have a medical community
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.540]   that has submitted to a firm.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.480]   The standard is a firm.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.460]   Not, are your parents going through a divorce?
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.040]   Did you have really bad grades?
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.660]   Was there a sexual assault in your past,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.860]   which is so often the case
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.060]   for a lot of the young girls in particular.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.800]   No, you're not even allowed to go there
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.700]   or you're considered engaging in conversion therapy.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.380]   It's crossover.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.220]   That's it.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.060]   Puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.420]   Those two things alone in that order,
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.380]   high, high likelihood you are sterile.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.820]   You are sterilizing yourself
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.100]   and your parents are allowing it.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.060]   Just puberty blockers into cross-sex hormones.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.900]   That's it.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.380]   Nevermind chopping off body parts.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.500]   And then they'll go to school
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   and they'll say, "I'm no longer a girl."
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.180]   And the school will hide it
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.980]   from the people who love that child most, their parents.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.720]   If the parents aren't on the affirm board,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.140]   in New York City, where I fled with my children
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.020]   'cause they were trying to do this
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.100]   to our schools and our classes,
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.580]   that's the policy, private and public.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.040]   You do not tell the parents.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.580]   It's a secret.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.300]   What kind of country are we getting to be
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.560]   where we allow secrets between grown teachers and minors
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.780]   that the parents aren't allowed to know?
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.020]   That's what we used to call grooming, right?
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.980]   It opens up a very dangerous door.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.180]   (audience applauding)
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.080]   - And why has this become politicized?
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.280]   And how has it become politicized?
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.980]   - That I don't understand.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.680]   I don't understand how, frankly,
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.640]   anyone can vote Democrat right now.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.160]   I just don't get it.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.680]   I know that there's a priority of issues, right?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.220]   And for some people, it's-
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.680]   Oh, David's here.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.520]   He just woke up.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.680]   For some people, I get it.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.920]   - Sachs or Democrat, what?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.460]   - It's abortion or it's, you know,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.540]   I can't think of the issues
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.600]   that would make you vote Democrat,
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.860]   even though I used to vote Democrat.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.220]   I'm a registered independent.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.820]   I voted in eight presidential elections.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.500]   I voted Democrat four times and Republican four.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.260]   I'm about as independent as you can get.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.740]   - Let me, can we, let's shift gears to the election then.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.580]   So- (audience laughing)
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.660]   - Yeah, you've piqued his interest.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.020]   - I didn't think that was gonna be funny, but.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.660]   So Megan, I mean, in addition to being a great broadcaster,
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.340]   you actually are a great political pundit,
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.020]   I would say, and prognosticator.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.580]   I remember being on your show
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.540]   at the beginning of the Republican primary
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.020]   when DeSantis was riding high,
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.900]   making the case for DeSantis.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.420]   Obviously that was totally wrong.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.080]   And you're like, no, you know, like, it's gonna be Trump.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.900]   You know, the Republican party is not done with Trump,
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.360]   and you were exactly right.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.380]   What's your take on where things are at right now?
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.840]   And do you have a take on who's gonna win?
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.160]   - I mean, of course we all wanna know that, right?
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.260]   That's why we follow these polls religiously,
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.900]   'cause we wanna peek into what's gonna happen.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.380]   I mean, I think Trump right now is better positioned to win
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.400]   than he's ever been in any election before.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.580]   If you look at where he is,
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.540]   let's take the New York Times-Siena poll that just dropped.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.460]   That's the gold standard.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.940]   That's the best poll, if you ask most pollsters.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.340]   Huge sample, and likely voters,
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.340]   and it's got Trump up one, which is basically a tie, up one.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.420]   This time, four years ago, Biden was up nine over Trump,
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.900]   and that election was this tight, and it had Biden up nine.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.660]   - It said the statistical probability
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.720]   of an electoral college for Trump was 99.7%.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.900]   - Yeah, if you look at the swing states,
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.740]   he's got a 63%. - Nate Silver's
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.220]   interpretation of that poll.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.340]   - Yeah. - That came out, yeah.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.700]   - And Nate, now the left is turning on Nate,
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.540]   inexplicably, really, I mean, other than his data.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.220]   But they loved Nate, and they created Nate,
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.020]   but now that Nate's numbers aren't going their way,
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.220]   they're like, "Who's Nate connected to?
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.180]   "Who's he working for?"
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.020]   Nate, like most prognosticators, wants to be right.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.780]   But look, I'll say this, and by the way, in '16,
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.300]   it showed Hillary up two at this point.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.660]   So, and Trump won that election.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.500]   The general wisdom is that the Democrat has to be up
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.080]   some four points or better in the national polling,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.780]   given the fact that they usually win the popular vote,
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.420]   just given how blue the urban centers are,
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.060]   in order to win, in order to cross over
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.660]   in those swing states, and right now, she's not.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.940]   I mean, that New York Times poll shows her down more.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.740]   - You were in the middle of the 2016 election.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.500]   I find this comparison very interesting,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.260]   so I'm curious your take.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.620]   Contrast and compare Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton,
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.620]   what day is it today, September 9th of that election,
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.180]   and Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, September 9th, now.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.960]   - Trump had some advantages back then
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.940]   that he doesn't have now,
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.260]   including his genuine outsider status.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.660]   It was very attractive to a lot of voters
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.300]   who had never voted before,
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.020]   speaking of getting up off your couch.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.860]   That really worked for him.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.860]   And Trump was incredibly vibrant, feisty, fiery, fun,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:22.060]   you know, provocative, obviously controversial,
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:22.900]   and new.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.000]   You know, we all knew Trump,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.300]   but we knew him as this crazy New York businessman
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.260]   with a lot of color,
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260]   and suddenly he morphed onto the political field
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.980]   like unlike anything we'd ever seen.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.360]   I mean, there was a reference to penis size
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.700]   in a presidential debate, yeah.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.540]   I was there.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.660]   So that happened.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.940]   This time around, people are a little bit more used
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.420]   to Trump's bits, right, his routine.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.340]   He's obviously a little older, but still vibrant.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.060]   I mean, could any of you have stood
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.200]   on that presidential stage
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.500]   and given a nearly two-hour address
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.580]   a week after someone shot you in the ear?
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.860]   Like, I was falling asleep, and I was seated and fine,
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.420]   you know, I'm like, I didn't need.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.700]   So he's got a lot of energy,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.060]   but he's not an outsider exactly anymore.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.900]   He is still one.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.660]   He's not taking like all the money of these fat cats
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.500]   and ready to kiss their bottoms necessarily,
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.420]   but he's lost that.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.040]   What he's gained is a record.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.020]   You know, now Trump can go on this debate stage
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.620]   tomorrow night with some real ammo,
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.500]   you know, were you better off four years than you are today,
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.980]   and really point to his policies.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.660]   One of the great tragedies of the Trump era has been
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.220]   his policies have been incredibly good for America.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.220]   It's just his rhetoric is so interesting.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.780]   - Toxic?
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.020]   - Depends on who you ask, right?
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.020]   Depends on who you ask.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.220]   That he--
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.060]   - Activating.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.340]   - That the majority of Americans dislike him.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.220]   - And then what about Hillary versus Kamala?
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.820]   - Oh God.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.920]   Well, Hillary was smart.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.620]   - They didn't hide Hillary.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.100]   Hillary did interviews, right?
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.900]   I had this conversation just this morning.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.500]   You can say what you want about Hillary Clinton,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.900]   but she is incredibly competent.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.740]   - Yeah.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.700]   - Incredibly competent.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.940]   - She's competent, and she could have done the job.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.140]   How she did it and with what level of honesty and corruption
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.100]   would be a different story.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.940]   But I really think the problem for Kamala Harris is
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.780]   she's not smart.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.460]   She's not a deep thinker.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.220]   She's very surface level.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.180]   Yes, she's giggling just like that.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.340]   The whole time. (audience laughing)
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.180]   - Spicy.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.860]   - Megan, tell us how you feel.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.780]   Really, be honest.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.820]   - And it's a cover.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.540]   It's an obvious cover, right?
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.980]   It's like she gets to the point
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.020]   where she doesn't know what she's saying.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.460]   Even she doesn't know what she's saying,
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.300]   and it's like, ah!
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.180]   And so you feel uncomfortable watching her,
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.420]   and then she gave her first interview to CNN,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.740]   and suddenly, if that's drunk Kamala,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.940]   suddenly we're dealing with hungover Kamala.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.860]   - My values haven't changed.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.660]   Clearly somebody had told her,
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.020]   you cackle, we're out of here.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.540]   - Yeah. (audience laughing)
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.420]   What did you think about her
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.340]   bringing her emotional support white guy?
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.260]   - Exactly.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.500]   Her emotional support governor?
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.940]   He was her big white blankie.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.780]   Like I used to have as a toddler.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.780]   - I mean, it made no sense.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.860]   It seemed like a terrible strategic decision.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.460]   Like who's making the decision to do that?
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.300]   - I agree.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.140]   I objected to the whole thing.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.420]   I think he was there for two purposes.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.780]   One was, yes, in case she got in real trouble,
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.340]   he could step in.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.180]   And the other was to suck up some of the air time
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.100]   so she had a couple of fewer questions to answer.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.940]   - What did you think of the job
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.460]   just broadcasted or broadcaster Dana Bash did?
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.100]   'Cause she did ask some tough questions.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.180]   She did probe a little bit.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.220]   - No, no. - Not enough?
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.180]   - She did terribly.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.300]   - Okay. (audience laughing)
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.940]   I mean, I don't think it was particularly hard, but--
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.540]   - But that was not a good job.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.380]   - Okay, explain why.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.820]   What would you have done differently?
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.660]   - So many things.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.300]   Go back and listen to my podcast the day after,
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.060]   'cause I just took it apart forensically bit by bit.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.300]   - I mean, give us the top three here.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.660]   - Where were the follow-up questions?
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.220]   Where were the hard-hitting follow-ups
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.940]   when she said her nonsense?
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.900]   Like, specifically how?
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.900]   What exactly caused you to change your mind?
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.620]   Walk me through the process.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.860]   And hit her with all of them, not just a couple.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.980]   And Tim Walz, grammar?
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.220]   The grammar excuse?
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.420]   That's why he said he carried a weapon into war?
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.900]   It was his grammar?
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.740]   What kind of BS was that?
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.820]   - And no follow-up, yeah.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.340]   - Yes, and honestly, all it would have taken was,
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.660]   do you really want our audience to believe
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.340]   you said you took weapons into war as a soldier?
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.300]   Okay, because every actual service personnel knows
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.140]   you don't exaggerate something like that.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.500]   That's hallowed ground.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.140]   You don't say you went into war when you didn't.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.220]   And he's already on the hot seat for having said,
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   you know, he was a command sergeant major
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.100]   and he didn't retire as such and so on.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.380]   Anyway, all it would have taken was,
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.740]   do you really want this audience to believe
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.580]   that was a grammatical error?
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.100]   Is that your story?
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.860]   No, none of that was done.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.380]   And it was just irritating because there's so much
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.660]   for Kamala Harris to be cross-examined on.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.060]   She just, she went to sleep, she was meek.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.140]   - And the follow-up question is just,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.580]   such an easy thing to do.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.300]   You don't even have to say it as aggressively as you did.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.140]   You just say, okay, so to be clear,
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.260]   let me repeat back to you.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.260]   Grammar is the reason you said this.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.100]   - But let me tell you something.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.940]   Let me tell you something.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.420]   Some aggression was warranted.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.260]   This is the problem.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.940]   Her timidity is part of the problem
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.980]   because I challenge anybody, go back and look.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.100]   I did an interview with Trump in September.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.420]   We've been through a lot, he and I.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.860]   - Well, yeah.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.260]   That's an interesting relationship.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.740]   - It's a very interesting relationship.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.220]   And I saw him at a Turning Point event the previous August
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.300]   and I said, I'd love to sit down with you.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.620]   He said, great, I'll do it.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.340]   So we sat down in September of last year.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.300]   It was a great interview.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.620]   It was challenging.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.980]   He was not in love with it.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.820]   Good.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.820]   - Which part?
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.500]   - Where I hammered him on the legal stuff.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.940]   It had a crescendo and a decrescendo
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.220]   like every good interview should.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.860]   You know, we started off with some stuff
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.780]   that he would like.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.020]   Joe Biden's old, how about that?
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.100]   And then you built.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.780]   - You warmed him up to classic strategy, right.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.260]   - So on the legal, on the law fair.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.900]   So Judge Mershon just moved the sentencing date
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.540]   from, I guess it was supposed to be a few days ago,
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.100]   to November 18th.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.700]   That occurs to me that's two weeks after the election.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.780]   So if Mershon wants to send Trump to prison
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.620]   but is afraid to do it now
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.060]   because it'd be a huge backlash for the election,
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.740]   seems to me that's kind of what you do.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.740]   You'd set the date two weeks after.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.380]   I mean, what's your take on that?
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.220]   Do you think--
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.060]   - If he gets elected--
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.900]   - If Trump loses the election,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.860]   do you think he's going to Rikers?
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.780]   - No, I don't.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.620]   - You don't think so?
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.580]   - I think there's a possibility Mershon will sentence him
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.900]   because this whole case,
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.940]   which was about him writing down something in a book
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.100]   no one ever saw.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.180]   It was in a book that stayed on the shelf at Trump Tower.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.620]   Didn't have the right thing.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.620]   It didn't say hush money to Stormy Daniels.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.580]   It said legal services.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.980]   No one ever saw that.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.060]   Just someone came knocking
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.100]   'cause they wanted to mess with Trump,
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.620]   found it and said this isn't recorded accurately.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.980]   It's a fraud and he got prosecuted.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.980]   And I think Judge Mershon has allowed Alvin Bragg
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.500]   to turn it into you tried to steal the election
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.340]   because now guys, I'm sorry to tell you,
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.580]   but if you ever want to run for office,
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.740]   you have an ethical obligation
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.660]   to let any woman accusing you of any bad stuff
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.700]   come forward and say it to everyone.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.660]   And if she says I won't hurt you publicly,
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.140]   whether it's true or not,
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.540]   if you just give me $130,000,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.740]   you may not pay her or you're gonna go to jail.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.660]   So you must let yourself be blackmailed.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.220]   Let someone say this stuff about you, true or not,
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.820]   or you're going to prison.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.540]   That's how that case was tried.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.660]   That is now the position
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.340]   that every politician is in, theoretically.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.140]   - I mean, the case made sense as a misdemeanor,
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:44.980]   but not as a felony.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.300]   I think you would agree. - No, it made no sense.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.540]   As a misdemeanor, the statute of limitations has expired.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.380]   - Sure, but I mean, it clearly was escalated to a point,
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.260]   but I wonder how you think, as with family members,
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.620]   you know, in the, you know, that are cops,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.860]   how you look at the other cases,
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.500]   and if you think there's any validity to them.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.100]   'Cause there are five cases we're talking about.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.540]   He's guilty of the first three so far out of three.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.420]   Some of them feel trumped up.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.580]   But what about the last two?
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.860]   You know, the documents and the January 6th one,
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.100]   do you think there's any validity to them?
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.380]   - No, no validity.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.860]   - Zero. - The only thing
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.580]   that Trump was potentially in trouble on,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.180]   and the thing I hit him on when we interviewed,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.980]   was not turning over the documents once he had a subpoena.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.220]   - Which would have been so easy to do.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.540]   - Yes, but-- - Which was dumb,
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.380]   but he's Trump.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.620]   - He should have turned them over.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.860]   - He always does self-destructive stuff.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.220]   - But that one's gone away now, too,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.860]   because of Jack Smith not being properly appointed
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.820]   down there, but in answer to your question on Judge Michon,
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.300]   I think he almost is in a position
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.660]   where he might have to sentence him to jail,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.140]   given how big they've tried to make it.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.460]   You stole an election.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.580]   You stole, but it would be at a suspended sentence.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.540]   It would be immediately appealed.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.300]   And I think Trump, on appeal, will win.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.380]   There are so many holes in that case,
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.820]   so I don't think Trump will ever do one single day in jail.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.580]   - So, Megan, if we look at the five cases,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.260]   you know, six months from now or a year from now,
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.620]   let's assume all five of them go to trial.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.300]   He's guilty of three so far.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.260]   - Wait, what do you mean he's guilty of three so far?
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.100]   What are you talking about? - Well, he's been convicted
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.940]   of three, sorry. - What do you mean?
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.420]   No, he hasn't.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.460]   - I love his-- - The, no,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.420]   E. Jean Carroll was guilty.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.500]   - That was not a conviction.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.780]   That was a civil case.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.060]   - Well, yeah, so that's what I'm talking about.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.900]   So that one-- - Okay, but there's
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.060]   a big difference. (audience laughing)
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.300]   - It's still he was convicted, he was guilty of that.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.500]   You got a sentiment.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.140]   In the, yeah, in the Trump organization,
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.980]   they're guilty there.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.460]   - Again, with civil, liable, liable.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.340]   - Yes, of course, but these are the cases
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.380]   we're talking about, and in the third one--
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.340]   - You don't see the lawyer, right?
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.540]   - Yeah, of course, and in the third one,
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.860]   I'm just talking about the five cases.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.260]   Yes, some are civil, obviously,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.500]   and some are not, some are criminal.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.340]   But if we look at all five cases--
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.260]   - You said three convictions.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.420]   Now you're walking it back.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.260]   - I'm not walking it back.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.100]   - Get it straight. - There's three
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.620]   in which he was-- - You should walk it back.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.460]   - Okay, guys, take it easy. - I'm so glad
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.740]   Megan is here to dispel this. - Of the five,
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.260]   three of them, he's either guilty or--
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.420]   - He got a bad result.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.860]   - Yeah, got a bad result.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.860]   There are two more.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.260]   If he is found guilty of those two more, Megan,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.740]   and five of five, he had a bad result,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.140]   way to frame it. (audience laughing)
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.460]   Will you chalk all five up, in your mind,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.020]   to five different jurisdictions,
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.740]   five different prosecutors,
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.820]   five different juries and/or judges,
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.460]   all conspiring to get him?
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.940]   - 100%, yes. - Okay, great.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.900]   That's all I wanted to hear your answer to.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.060]   Five of five, five different jurisdictions,
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.900]   you think it's all lawfare. - Yeah, I mean,
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.420]   E. Jean Carroll, they changed the law
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.180]   so that she could bring a civil lawsuit against him,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.020]   and she did.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.220]   New York went 87% for Joe Biden.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.620]   That fix was in right from the start.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.940]   The fraud trial that Letitia James brought against him
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.020]   has never been brought.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.860]   There's no victims.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.700]   The banks who were involved said, "We didn't lose a penny.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.540]   "What are we doing here?
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.580]   "We weren't damaged."
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.380]   Nobody was complaining except Tish James,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.420]   who ran for office saying, "I will get him."
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.540]   Then you have Alvin Bragg,
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.260]   who's a George Soros-funded prosecutor
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.260]   who doesn't like to prosecute any crime in New York City
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.620]   where I lived for 17 years,
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.300]   except if your name is Donald Trump.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.340]   Let's go down to Georgia,
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.780]   where Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.740]   couldn't keep their libidos in check long enough
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.980]   to actually bring this case against Donald Trump.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.740]   It's a repeat of what was happening in January 6th,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.620]   up in the case with Judge Chutkin,
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.100]   who loathes Trump and has sentenced
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.060]   almost every J6 defendant to way more jail time
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.500]   than their counterparts would get.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.740]   Those are falling apart because of presidential immunity,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.140]   which was handed down by the Supreme Court,
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.580]   who said, "You cannot bring a criminal case
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.260]   "against a sitting president for any official act."
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.780]   Those cases have been gutted,
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.940]   also a Supreme Court ruling saying the same
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.740]   on January 6th defendants in general.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.220]   And that leaves us with Florida and the documents.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.180]   And Trump has torn that apart
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.900]   because Jack Smith wasn't properly appointed
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.460]   and isn't the right counsel,
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.260]   but there are other issues they haven't even gotten
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.900]   to presidential immunity there,
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.660]   and so that one's going nowhere as well.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.020]   And by the way, they're gonna peel it up
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.860]   to the 11th Circuit.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.780]   She just threw it out.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.020]   The 11th Circuit is conservative,
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.980]   and thank God so is the current Supreme Court.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.300]   They're not gonna tolerate that nonsense.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.140]   - Let me ask you about--
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.220]   - I think--
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.980]   - Let me just ask you--
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.740]   - I think Jay Cowell just lost his right
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.420]   to ever bring up lawfare again.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.540]   - No, we're here to--
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.500]   - We're done with your bullshit, it's over.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.340]   - I didn't give--
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.660]   We're not here to hear my opinion.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.700]   I didn't give my opinion.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.540]   I wanted my--
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.980]   - Let's talk about the Democratic Party
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.980]   and the Republican Party 2028, post all of this, okay?
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.700]   I suspect because of your influence,
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.860]   so tell me if this is not even true,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.140]   but up-and-coming folks are probably trying
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.980]   to meet you all the time
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.300]   because they wanna build a relationship,
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.780]   build a rapport so that when it's time
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.660]   for them to get interviewed or whatever,
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.820]   there's a, so you must see a lot of people.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.700]   Just give us a state of politicians
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.100]   post this current batch.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.420]   What is the same, what's different?
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.700]   - I don't feel very optimistic.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.700]   - Okay, is it getting worse?
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.700]   - Yeah, it's getting worse because of Instagram and AOC,
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.620]   that kind of person.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.980]   Yes, her specifically, but not just her.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.540]   - Say more.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.500]   - These are congressional Kardashians.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.420]   Can I tell you something?
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.900]   My experience in the news business,
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.540]   dealing with politicians leads me to believe
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.060]   that the people in this room and on this stage
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.140]   over your two-day conference
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.500]   are the people we need to be looking to
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.700]   for our future leaders and ideas and to save the country.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.540]   (audience applauding)
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.940]   It's not Washington, D.C.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.940]   All the incentives to be a good person are gone.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.620]   It's not that there aren't any good ones.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.500]   There definitely are, and there's some true patriots
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.020]   who are still trying to serve and even--
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.460]   - Who are two people, just on either side
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.100]   that you would just tell us to look out for,
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.020]   or even they are already doing the job
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.620]   where you say these two people are like good people?
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.380]   (laughing)
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.140]   - You should play the little "Jeopardy" music right now.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.500]   No one's coming to mind off the top of my head,
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.640]   but I know that there are some.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.520]   Look, I like Rand Paul.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.540]   I think Rand Paul's a good and honest man.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.980]   - Don't run a giant deficit.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.820]   It's not a bad boy.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.180]   - I mean, all of them lie,
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.060]   so I'm not trying to excuse all of that.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.580]   They all do.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.060]   But if you watch people long enough,
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.420]   you find the ones that stand up for the right issues
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.780]   and seem to have some integrity,
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.260]   that's one that comes to mind.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.620]   There used to be a day where they would reach
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.140]   across the aisle, and they actually weren't just there
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.980]   for clicks or to make themselves famous.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.460]   And those days are few and far between now.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.740]   I just think with, look, I supported
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.460]   the Supreme Court's decision in Citizen United,
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.900]   and I think big money in politics was always gonna happen,
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.660]   but it's corrupted the system in a way that,
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.500]   you know, most politicians only have to answer
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.740]   to their one group of big donors
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.100]   or their one small constituency
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.340]   and their one very red or very blue town.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.580]   And there's no more incentive to compromise.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.540]   There's only incentive to get reelected,
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.860]   which is one of the frustrations we have.
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.460]   And we watch Washington, nothing gets done,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.500]   or a size of relief in this Congress
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.460]   where we watch Washington and nothing gets done, right?
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.100]   Right now, I'm all about going back
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.180]   to the original founding version of this country
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.260]   where government was as small as possible,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.500]   the presidency was as small as possible,
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.220]   and these people do as little as humanly possible
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.060]   while they're in office.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.700]   - I feel, Megan, I feel like someone should do
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.940]   like a modern-day recap of the Federalist Papers,
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.340]   like an understanding of the basis
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.740]   of the foundation of the republic,
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.260]   like what were the founding philosophies,
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.500]   and then understanding how far astray we've gone.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.500]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.300]   What constitutional amendments would you pass
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.740]   to fix the incentive problems?
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.020]   If you could have your druthers
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.820]   pass any constitutional amendment or two,
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.580]   what would they be to address the incentive issue
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.540]   that's causing a lot of the integrity and misalignment?
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.300]   - I don't think it starts like that.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.540]   I think it is, just like Kamala Harris's choice
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.500]   as Biden's replacement, it's bottom-up, it's bottom-up.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.860]   That's the lie, remember they told us,
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.020]   Chuck Schumer, it's bottom-up, the people chose her.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.540]   Literally nobody's voted for her to be the nominee.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.380]   I think this one does have to be bottom-up.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.300]   Like if we're gonna change the way we elect politicians
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.980]   and the way we govern ourselves,
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.860]   it's so much more complex
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.540]   than just what laws are written down.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.060]   And tech has a lot to do with it.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.340]   How divided we are, how disconnected we are,
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.420]   how lonely we are.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.700]   I mean, right now the latest strain
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.700]   of the argument is interesting,
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.660]   which is all the processed foods are making us weird
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:28.340]   and unhealthy and dying and dividing people further
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.500]   because it's driving our hormones nuts
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.700]   and our behavior is getting weirder.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.540]   - And obese.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.860]   - Yeah, and obesity.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.780]   So I mean, there's just a lot we need to reconsider
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.420]   about the way we're living.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.660]   And I do think one of the main things
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.100]   is we need to see each other again.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.060]   We need to like look at each other in the eye
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.780]   across the table.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.100]   We need to ban our kids from playing on the devices
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.220]   when they get together for playdates.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.860]   We must insist that they play outside without any devices
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.140]   and actually connect with nature.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.300]   We must make sure that they do the same.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.940]   We must get out of the coastal cities
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.140]   and go to fly over country and go to a rodeo in Montana.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.980]   Something like that.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.460]   (audience applauding)
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.360]   We have to start loving our country again.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.860]   That's a huge piece of it.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.580]   And that again is community.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.220]   Speaking of rodeo in Montana, we go out there.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.580]   We have a little ski cabin there, which we love.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.300]   And we went in the summer, brought our kids to a rodeo.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.580]   They started playing the national anthem.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.020]   And my little guy at the time was like five.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.060]   And he was a little slow to get up, right?
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.700]   Like he knows to get up, but he was like five.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.420]   And there's this old cowboy sitting right behind us
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.700]   with the big hat and the jeans and the belt.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.740]   And he goes, "Boy, you better get on your feet."
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.620]   And my son was like, "Oh shit, yes sir."
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.660]   That was me.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.700]   But I was like right on.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.540]   - That's great.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.820]   - Right on, that's what we need, right?
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.900]   Like more of that and more of looking out for one another,
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.500]   not with forced taxes and through the eyeballs
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   and all that nonsense.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.420]   But like your neighbor's sick, go make him a casserole.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.660]   Your older neighbor is housebound, go mow her lawn.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.140]   That is the stuff that used to make us us.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.020]   And as we just retreat into our devices
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.460]   and our television screens and all of it,
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.260]   we lose that and we lose us.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.660]   - All right, well said.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, Megyn Kelly.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.900]   - Thank you.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.820]   - Whoa, standing out.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.980]   That was awesome.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.320]   - Really awesome.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.060]   (audience applauding)
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.700]   you
