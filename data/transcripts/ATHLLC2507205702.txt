[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.120]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.080]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.080]   and today, in honor of it being the season of giving,
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.000]   I wanna share one of the most interesting
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400]   and inspiring stories I've ever heard
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.480]   and talk a bit about water
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.560]   and how helping the one in 10 people
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.780]   who don't have access to clean water
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.620]   might be one of the greatest hacks
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.620]   we'll ever discuss on this show.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.460]   Why?
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.720]   Well, when it comes to health,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.680]   diseases from dirty water kill more people every year
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.360]   than all forms of violence, including war.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.060]   And every day, women and girls
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.460]   who happen to be responsible for water collection
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.980]   in eight of 10 households around the world
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.980]   spend an estimated 200 million hours
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.860]   collecting water each day.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.900]   That's time taken away from education,
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.820]   work, community development, and family.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.340]   Providing clean water is more than a solution
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.580]   to just drinking water.
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.900]   It is a key to unlocking potential
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.380]   and fighting poverty around the world.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.400]   But don't take that lesson just from me.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.740]   Listen to this conversation with my friend, Scott Harrison,
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.460]   the founder of Charity Water,
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.560]   who after a decade of indulging
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.620]   in the darkest vices as a nightclub promoter
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.020]   turned everything about his life around
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.420]   and has since raised almost a billion dollars
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.840]   and helped over 17 million people
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.980]   get access to clean water in 29 countries around the world.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.700]   He'll not only share that story,
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.820]   but we'll talk about evaluating charities
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.060]   the power of storytelling, setting personal goals,
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.220]   gratitude, and a lot more.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.020]   This may not be a typical All The Hacks episode,
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.360]   but I promise it's one you'll remember.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.060]   In fact, even though I've known Scott
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.620]   and Charity Water for years,
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.860]   this conversation was so impactful
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.460]   that Amy and I decided we wanted
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.100]   to get more involved this year.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.500]   So we're running a campaign through Daffy
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.540]   to raise $10,000, which is what it takes
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.220]   to fund a water project in one community.
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.460]   And Amy and I are personally gonna match
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780]   the first $5,000 we raise to help get to our $10,000 goal.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.620]   Or maybe we can go past that goal
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.380]   and do two, three, or even more projects.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.220]   Who knows, but we are excited to see what's possible.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.760]   So if you wanna consider giving to the campaign,
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.420]   you can go to allthehacks.com/water.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.800]   And like I said, we're doing this whole campaign
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.280]   through our partner Daffy,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.020]   which is the platform Amy and I have been using for years
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.020]   to do all our charitable giving more efficiently.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.460]   They do that by helping you set up
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.300]   a special tax-advantaged account
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.380]   called a Donor Advised Fund, or DAF,
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.480]   which works whether you're giving a few hundred dollars
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.540]   to charity each year, or even hundreds of thousands.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.360]   Now, to participate in this fundraiser,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.320]   you don't need to set up a Donor Advised Fund at Daffy.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.940]   You can contribute directly.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.700]   But if you wanna set up a Donor Advised Fund
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.740]   with Daffy first, you can get an extra $25
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.120]   to donate to this or any other cause
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.300]   once you make your first contribution
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.380]   at allthehacks.com/daffy, D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.540]   And once you're all set up,
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.460]   you can head back to our campaign
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.220]   at allthehacks.com/water to contribute and get your match.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.060]   Both those links are in the show notes.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.040]   Thank you so much for your support.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.580]   Let's jump into the episode right after this.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.020]   Our sponsor today, Trade Coffee,

[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.540]   - Scott, thank you so much for being here.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.040]   - Hey, it's good to be here, Chris.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.980]   I've been looking forward to this, it's gonna be fun.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.540]   - Yes, for so many people, they've seen you,
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.240]   they know Charity Water, but they don't know the story.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.340]   And I think there's a lot of things I wanna dive into
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.260]   that mean going back to the beginning
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.620]   and understanding where you came from
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620]   because it's not the same story
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.100]   that most people go through.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.620]   - Well, I think act one is a pretty bizarre childhood.
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.180]   When I was four, I was born in Philadelphia,
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.700]   middle-class family, dad was a business guy,
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.900]   my mom was a writer,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.700]   and we moved into this really ugly gray house
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.060]   at the end of a cul-de-sac in the dead of winter.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.620]   My parents were gonna have a big family there
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.380]   and it was close to my dad's job,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.620]   so we had a small commute.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.980]   These were all the concerns at the time.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.060]   And the house was advertised as energy efficient,
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.900]   which was great,
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.000]   except the house came with a carbon monoxide gas leak.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.460]   So we move in and we all start getting headaches.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.940]   And on New Year's Day, 1980,
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.540]   my mom walks across the bedroom and she collapses
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.300]   and she crumples to the floor.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.740]   So she's the canary in the coal mine,
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.480]   which leads to a series of blood tests,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.100]   which leads to the discovery of carbon monoxide
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.380]   in her bloodstream, which then leads to the leak,
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.400]   which was in the basement
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.580]   and it was this faulty heat exchanger.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.540]   And I remember my dad ripped it out with an HVAC guy
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.300]   and he threw it on the sidewalk,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.940]   but unfortunately the damage was just done
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.900]   specifically for my mom and she just never recovered.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.760]   She never bounced back from that.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.460]   My dad and I bounced back from our symptoms,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.580]   but what happened to her was her immune system
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.640]   was irreparably destroyed
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.260]   and her body was no longer able to process chemicals,
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.100]   process anything toxic.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.340]   So I think the best way to describe it from this point on,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.900]   she just lived in a bubble.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.820]   She lived in one room, isolated.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.420]   She wore a 3M mask, like an N95,
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.300]   really for the rest of her life.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.500]   And family planning stopped.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.540]   So I grew up this only child,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.460]   very quickly now in a caregiver role,
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.280]   helping to cook for mom, helping to clean,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.380]   helping try to make her as comfortable as possible.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.840]   And maybe just to give everybody one story
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.040]   that I remember as a kid.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.400]   I remember mom, she was a writer,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.880]   so she loved to read and she was so frustrated
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.600]   that now the ink from books would make her sick.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.640]   So as a kid, I would either bake her books in the oven
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.280]   to try to get that smell of new print out,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.360]   or I would put them out in the backyard
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.100]   and flip the pages throughout the day
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.480]   so that the sun would kind of bake them.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.720]   And then I would walk up to the second floor
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.600]   and she was living in a bathroom
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   that was covered with aluminum foil.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.960]   She slept on a cot that had been washed
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.960]   in baking soda 20 times.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.280]   And I remember she would open the door
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.880]   kind of with this crinkle sound,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.560]   and she would be wearing her mask and her glasses.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.720]   She'd be wearing cotton gloves.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.440]   She would take the book from me
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.140]   and she would put it inside a cellophane bag,
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.560]   shut the door, and then she was able to read.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.580]   So just weird, Chris.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.180]   My parents were devout Christians,
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.700]   kind of non-denominational Christians,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.540]   so they had a really authentic faith
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.300]   that they would certainly attribute
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.880]   as the only way that they stayed married
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.700]   and kept the family together.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.780]   And I was actually actively raised in the church,
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.900]   so I would go on Sundays and I would play piano
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.940]   in Sunday school.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.400]   And I was just a good kid growing up.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.380]   I didn't smoke, I didn't drink, I didn't sleep around.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.260]   I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.420]   and I was gonna cure mom and other people I'd met
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.260]   like her.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.520]   So that was kind of act one.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.320]   Act two was a big detour from that.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   At 18, I start acting out this cliche
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.120]   prodigal son rebellion story,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.040]   and I grow my hair down to my shoulders,
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.680]   I join a rock band, and I move to New York City.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.720]   And the band immediately breaks up
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.340]   because we all hated each other,
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.560]   but I stumble into this occupation
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.280]   in New York City nightlife.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.560]   And I realized that if a person wanted to rebel,
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.280]   you could rebel in style as a nightclub promoter.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.040]   And all you had to do was get the right,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.000]   beautiful, famous people inside the club
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.960]   alongside people with money,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.540]   and then you could sell them a $25 cocktail
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.800]   or a $1,000 bottle of champagne that cost you only 40.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.160]   And act two, that was the next 10 years of my life,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.200]   running around New York City packing nightclubs.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.440]   I wound up working at 40 different nightclubs,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.560]   really to the horror and sadness of my parents,
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.840]   who saw their good, virginal Christian kid
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.320]   now out there smoking 40 cigarettes a day,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.480]   doing drugs, going to strip clubs, drinking problem,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.080]   just a total hedonistic mess.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.320]   And it was really at the end of that 10 years
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.400]   where I realized, wow, I'm a mess.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   And I've really become emotionally bankrupt,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.120]   come spiritually bankrupt.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.080]   I've come so far from this real foundation
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.280]   that my parents had tried to lay for me in my childhood
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.060]   as helping others, this idea of being a doctor.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.360]   I'd served nobody but myself for 10 years.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.420]   And that really led me to this moment
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.480]   of cathartic self-discovery and saying, I need a change.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.760]   This is not working out.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.200]   And I've got to go not find a pivot here.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.800]   I need to explore 180 degree change.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.540]   What's the opposite of everything
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.740]   I've been doing for 10 years?
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.880]   What's the opposite of everything
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.820]   I've been thinking and speaking?
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.080]   And being a pretty radical guy, I had this one idea.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.560]   What if I sold everything I owned
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.200]   and I volunteered for one year on a humanitarian mission?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.080]   What if I gave back one year of the 10 years
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.880]   that I'd selfishly wasted and could I be useful?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.000]   So it was pretty quick.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.960]   I remember from the dial-up internet cafe,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   putting in all these applications
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.800]   to the famous humanitarian organizations
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.080]   I had tangentially heard of, the Save the Children's
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.480]   and Oxfam's and Doctors Without Borders
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   and World Visions and Red Crosses of the World.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.320]   And then I put in my 10 applications and I waited.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.760]   And maybe no surprise to anybody listening,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.160]   I'm denied by all 10 organizations.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.400]   Turns out they are not looking for nightclub promoters
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.260]   or ex-nightclub promoters to work alongside.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.560]   And I just remember being so sad,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   so disappointed that I thought I was ready for change.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.120]   I take this first step and nobody will have me.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.560]   Well, I was very fortunate that there was one organization
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.000]   that actually at first denied me
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.960]   and then they were about to start their mission
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.400]   and they couldn't fill that position.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.520]   So they went back through the rejected resumes
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.320]   and they called me up and said,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.000]   if I'm willing to pay them $500 a month
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.960]   and if I'm willing to go live
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.720]   in the poorest country in the world,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.680]   a country called Liberia in West Africa,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.720]   then I could join their humanitarian mission.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.760]   And the role that they had for me was a photojournalist.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.120]   Now I was technically not a photojournalist
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.360]   but I had gone to NYU part-time,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.400]   I'd gotten a communications degree
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.840]   and I was a pretty decent photographer
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.600]   and a pretty decent writer.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   So my life changed so dramatically as I left nightlife
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.720]   and set foot in the poorest country in the world,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.400]   a country with no electricity, no running water,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.880]   no sewage system, no mail system,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.000]   a country that had just come out of a 14-year civil war.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.240]   And I joined this mission
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.360]   of humanitarian doctors and surgeons,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.280]   people who had come from 40 countries
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.560]   to volunteer their time and offer free medical services
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.080]   to people who couldn't afford it,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.000]   where those services didn't exist.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.480]   And that really was the beginning of Act III,
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.720]   which then eventually led to my discovery
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.760]   of the need for clean water and then founding Charity Water.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.040]   - When it comes to building wealth,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.600]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.320]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.640]   being proactive right now to lower your future liability
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.960]   is so important.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.520]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.920]   I feel like I finally have a partner I can trust
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.240]   to handle everything for my personal and business taxes,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.800]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.720]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.040]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.640]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.800]   but also it's so easy to communicate with them.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.120]   There's an in-house team of expert CPAs
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.360]   who can recommend the most effective tax strategies
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.760]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.920]   And my favorite story
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.880]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.560]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.800]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.760]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.800]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.480]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.040]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.560]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.240]   you can skip the wait list.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, that's G-E-L-T.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.060]   to stop overpaying on taxes.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.080]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.640]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.560]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.640]   for this episode.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.840]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.520]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.040]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.840]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.920]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.760]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.440]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.040]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.480]   And it's not just for men.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.880]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.520]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.960]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.480]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.520]   I've ever owned.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.320]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.400]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.320]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.480]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.760]   Or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.680]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.000]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.480]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.560]   So definitely check them out at allthehacks.com/viore.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.280]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/V-U-O-R-E,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.320]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.760]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.680]   So we're gonna get through to a lot of these things.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.200]   And when I think about that hard change you made,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.360]   did something inspire you?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.120]   Did it build up over time?
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.800]   I know countless people who don't feel like
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.200]   they're doing their life's work,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.800]   and they haven't hit that moment.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.480]   Maybe they also haven't been as far from their life's work
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.200]   in their previous career as you were.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.800]   But what advice do you have for that transition point?
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   I think it did build up over time.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.400]   And then there was this catalyst where,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.440]   I remember I started having some health issues.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.800]   And one day, half my body went numb,
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.040]   and I couldn't feel my hand or my arm.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.560]   I remember walking over my loft,
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.240]   turning on the water, steaming hot water in the sink,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.600]   and I put my hand and arm under it,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.360]   and I can't feel anything.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.800]   So I am convinced something is terribly wrong with me.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.120]   I have some brain tumor, I have some incurable disease,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.640]   and I'm gonna die.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.600]   And that actually led me to really consider
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.160]   existential questions of the heaven and hell
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   that I was raised with as a kid.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   Questions about legacy, questions about,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.520]   did it matter that I was here at all?
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.360]   What had I done for others?
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.800]   It turned out that nobody could find anything wrong with me.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.320]   So after a series of brain tests and MRIs and EKG scans,
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.200]   it could have been my lifestyle
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.560]   of going to dinner at 10, going to the club at 12,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.720]   going to the after hours to do cocaine from five to noon,
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.160]   and then taking Ambien at 1 p.m. to come down.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.720]   Might have had something to do with my body
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.680]   just crying out and shutting down, or at least half of it.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.160]   But that was an event that I think caused me
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.840]   to really stop and take stock of life and legacy
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.160]   and want to just change everything.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.320]   You know, not even get back on track.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.400]   You know, create a completely new path or a new track.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.320]   - And when you created that path,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.640]   you didn't know what it would be.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.600]   And I think a lot of people assume
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.520]   that if I don't love what I'm doing,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.360]   I need to find what I love before I can make a change.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.280]   Would you argue that maybe that is incorrect common wisdom?
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.480]   - I completely stumbled into it.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.320]   You know, I should say,
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.960]   when I went to join this medical mission,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.280]   I quit all the stuff that I mentioned.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.040]   I remember having my last cigarette.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   I remember saying I'm never gonna touch drugs again.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.120]   I'm never gonna look at a pornographic image again.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.400]   I really want to kind of shed all of these vices
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.960]   that have gripped me for a decade.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.000]   And what was so important for me
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.320]   was also changing community and environment.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.280]   It was much easier not to smoke two packs of Marlboro Reds
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.760]   or get high when you're surrounded by humanitarian doctors.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.080]   Not so easy when your job is nightlife
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.000]   and filling clubs five nights a week.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.560]   So for me, I think I was so fortunate
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.040]   that the intention was there to change,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.080]   but then my environment also changed.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.640]   I don't know that I would have had the self-control
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.560]   to just quit all that stuff cold turkey
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.800]   while I'm still surrounded by thousands
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   of drunk partying people.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.280]   - And you probably didn't know the goal
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.160]   going into this one-year adventure
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.520]   was to get into charitable work for your life.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.560]   It was just to reset and start over, I guess.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.400]   - Correct.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.320]   It's just where it took me.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.240]   Yeah, and in fact, at the end of the year,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.520]   I just signed up for another year
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.120]   'cause I just didn't know what was next,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.720]   but I wanted more life, more impact like this.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   And the cool thing, Chris, was when I landed in Liberia
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.280]   as a photojournalist for this medical mission,
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.440]   I had about 15,000 emails that I brought with me.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.040]   And back then, email open rates were close to 100%.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.120]   I was taking this whole group of people
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.800]   that I had invited to 40 different clubs over a decade
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.320]   and was sharing what I was seeing.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.280]   They were living vicariously through this guy
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.360]   that they had known and partied with
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.160]   who is now embedded with really badass,
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.840]   life-changing doctors and surgeons in this country
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.560]   that's 14 years post-war.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.480]   And with these people trying to pick up the pieces
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.040]   and serve some of the greatest human needs,
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.520]   maybe even on the planet at that time.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.920]   So, I joke that there were certainly a few unsubscribes
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.040]   in the beginning.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.400]   People were saying, "Look, that Prada party that you said,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.240]   that was awesome.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.160]   That store party you threw for the opening,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.520]   that MTV thing you did with Perry Farrell was awesome,
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.320]   but I'm not signing up for cleft lips and cleft tumors."
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.680]   That was really the small minority.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.160]   Maybe the ability to tell stories visually
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.320]   of what I was seeing actually grew the list
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.280]   and people began to donate money and sponsor surgeries.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.400]   And then people began to volunteer and say,
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.200]   "Well, Scott can go and find a way to be useful.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.360]   I work at Chanel.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.040]   I'd like some of that feeling of purpose in my life as well."
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.960]   So, I was kind of able to redeem some of the things
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.880]   that I learned over those 10 years,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.680]   even though they were directed selfishly
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.160]   or they were directed in a hedonistic way.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.080]   I think the thing that I had learned
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   was how to tell stories.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.480]   The story I was telling then, Chris,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.720]   was get past my velvet rope,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   get seen by us looking through the one-way glass,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.680]   get picked to come in,
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.560]   then sit with all the beautiful, rich, famous people,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.200]   spend a whole lot of money,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.160]   and your life has great meaning.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   You have arrived.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.560]   I'd gotten so good at telling that story
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.120]   that I was just telling the wrong story.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.920]   So, when I started telling a very different story
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   of doctors who had passionately given up their vacation time,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.960]   who had not flown to the Four Seasons in the Maldives,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.040]   but had come to the poorest country in the world
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:49.240]   for a couple months to serve and get nothing in return,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.120]   people were really moved by that.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.840]   But the skill had been learned
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.920]   in a very different environment, maybe.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.960]   - Yeah, you talked about the person in Chanel
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.520]   trying to have a bit more purpose.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.160]   At what point in time did you find
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.480]   that doing this was your purpose?
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.320]   Or I guess, what is your purpose now?
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.800]   - Well, I think almost immediately.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.640]   I loved it.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.840]   I mean, I remember getting asked a lot,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.680]   "Oh, isn't it hard?
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.320]   "You're living in this 120-square-foot cabin
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.400]   "with two roommates,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.560]   "and the ship was not a cruise liner.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.840]   "This was not a carnival cruise.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.160]   "The thing was 53 years old,
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.760]   "had rats and mice and cockroaches,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.600]   "and it was a very, very old, broken-down ship,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.640]   "which actually had to be retired a couple years later."
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   But I was so inspired by being surrounded
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.000]   with people who served others.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.640]   I think it was really that simple,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.480]   who were just asking the question,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.240]   "How can I take what I've been blessed with?
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.160]   "How can I take my time, my talent, my money,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   "and use it to help others?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.920]   "Use it to end some of this needless suffering
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.040]   "out there in the world?"
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.400]   So I think I was just surrounded, Chris,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.480]   with people with the exact opposite intention
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.680]   for the life I'd lived for 10 years,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.360]   and the lives of the people that I was curating
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.800]   or that I was surrounded,
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.240]   which was really how much pleasure can we bring to ourself
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.520]   at any given moment of any given day
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.680]   and all the moments of all the days
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.440]   versus how can we help, how can we serve?
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.360]   - And do you think that is a formula
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.960]   for a more fulfilling life?
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.000]   - I'm very careful to tell others.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.760]   I mean, I think I have my personal experience.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.840]   I have found there's a real freedom
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.760]   that comes with service.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.520]   We've had donors over the years.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.200]   Someone's about to go buy a BMW
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.520]   and will come across Charity Water
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.920]   and will buy a Toyota Prius instead
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.840]   and donate the difference
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.880]   to go help a couple communities get access to clean water.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   So I have seen sacrificial giving.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.800]   I've seen purpose-driven work improve the lives
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.080]   of so many people now through our community.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.120]   We've had millions of donors around the world.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.720]   I believe so, you know, certainly true for me
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.400]   and certainly true from what I've observed.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.640]   I will say, Chris, like there was never enough.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.880]   Yes, somebody always had a more beautiful girlfriend
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.120]   who was more famous.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.480]   Somebody always had a better car, a better plane.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.120]   If I was with a group of people
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.800]   gambling $10,000 a hand at blackjack,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.720]   somebody else was gambling $100,000 a hand.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.480]   So it was this insatiable lust for more,
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.360]   but there was no end point.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.600]   And looking back at that,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.360]   there was never going to be enough.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.600]   And in fact, I still know people who are out at the clubs
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.440]   and they are now dating girls younger than their daughters.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.920]   You know, just continually looking for more,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.880]   looking for more, looking for those markers of success,
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.200]   knowing that somebody's always got
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.560]   a little bit more than you.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.800]   And it's not like that when you embrace a life of service.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.000]   I guess it's more to a different degree.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.760]   There's more work to be done.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.600]   One of my favorite quotes,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.640]   somebody sent me from a New York City bodega
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.960]   like almost 20 years ago.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.920]   And it was a sign outside a deli that says,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.800]   "Do not be afraid of work with no end."
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.600]   And that's really how I see, you know,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.400]   17 years at Charity Water now
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.040]   is there's always another person to help.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.840]   There's always another community that needs clean water.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.320]   Let's say we get to the end of the water crisis,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.080]   which I truly believe is possible.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.320]   And I truly hope we do.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.280]   People are always asking me,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.160]   "So you're just going to put yourself out of business, right?
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.200]   Oh, charity should put themselves out of business."
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.960]   I think that's one of the stupidest concepts
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.800]   I've ever heard.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.320]   We've helped 17 million people get clean water.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.800]   If we get to 100 million served, 300 million served,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.080]   if we eradicate this problem,
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.040]   I would hope we would take everything we have learned
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.640]   over decades of working with donors,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.360]   building trust, building relationship.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.400]   I would hope we'd take everything we've learned,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.800]   operating in 30 really difficult countries around the world.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.600]   And we'd say, "Great, everybody now has water.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.520]   What else could we do together?
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.920]   What else could we do with our donors?
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.960]   What else could we do with our team members
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.080]   and all this expertise?
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.600]   Are there people hungry?
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.040]   Are there people without access to healthcare?
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   Are there people that don't have a roof over their heads?
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.200]   Let's take everything we've learned.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.280]   Let's go focus on that next critical human need
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.520]   or that next group of people who are needlessly suffering."
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.520]   Rather than let's drop the mic,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.200]   shut down the organization and go all try to become,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   you know, millionaires finally.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.680]   - Let's talk about that because, you know,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.200]   the mission is never ending, right?
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.680]   You've dedicated yourself and the organization you built
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.280]   to a life of service.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.560]   There's no end in sight, right?
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.520]   There will always probably be something, unfortunately,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.400]   that the world needs to be less suffering
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.160]   and people in a better place.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.000]   How do you make time for yourself in that world?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.960]   You mentioned, you know, the selfishness of your past.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.320]   Is a little bit of selfishness okay?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.640]   Can you take yourself out to dinner?
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.680]   Can you go on a vacation?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.720]   Or because you've been so close to it,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   I can't remember the number,
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.080]   but it's, you know, a very small amount of money each month
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   to provide someone with water.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   So how do you not want to give everything?
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.400]   - It's personality.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.720]   I'm both optimistic, but I'm also very pragmatic.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.440]   And I think maybe, you know,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.280]   my experience in 10 years of clubs
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.200]   has helped me take a long view at this.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.960]   And I realized going out to dinner with my wife
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.840]   is really important.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   Going out to family dinners is important for our family.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.080]   There are certain things that I try to be a really,
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.120]   really good steward of money.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.200]   I know a lot of people are a fan of your travel hacks
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.520]   and we were talking about this offline before.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.120]   You know, I'm on about a hundred planes a year
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   and I just fly coach.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.520]   We have never used a single donor dollar
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.040]   to fly me or any other executive, you know,
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.720]   or anybody at the organization in business class
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.800]   because we take that extra money,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.480]   which in my case would be, you know,
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.040]   hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   And we put that back in the mission.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.080]   So there are certain things
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.400]   that you're taking an austerity stance on.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.600]   But, you know, there are other things that, I mean,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.280]   I think I live a pretty normal life.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.560]   You know, I've got a nine-year-old and a seven-year-old
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.520]   and I have one that's nine weeks old now.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.480]   We had our surprise third.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.040]   I'm almost 50, my wife's 40.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.560]   But, you know, I really think about just making sure
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.160]   my kids are able to go play sports
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.360]   and live in a safe house in a safe neighborhood.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.880]   And, you know, when they need bikes,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.760]   I go and buy them bikes.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.320]   I'm not thinking, oh my gosh,
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.440]   if my nine-year-old goes without a bike,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.280]   I can go give two more people in Africa
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.440]   access to clean water.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.440]   I think it kind of take a long, sustainable view.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.120]   If my family is healthy,
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.000]   if my relationship with my wife is healthy,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.240]   you know, I'm probably gonna be able to do this
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.800]   a whole lot longer and hopefully impact the lives
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.080]   of hundreds of millions of people
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.920]   by sustaining the energy or the passion or the mission.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   I spent a lot of time in proximity to extraordinary wealth.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.240]   And I know it does not make people happy.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.120]   The most unhappy people I know
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.240]   are some of the wealthiest people that I know.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.520]   And just because, you know,
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.480]   you've got hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.400]   or billions of dollars,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   does not make for a healthy, flourishing relationship,
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.320]   family, you know, holistic life.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.120]   So there's no mystery, I think,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.600]   around money or capital that I'm chasing anymore.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.480]   In fact, sometimes even the opposite.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.280]   - And how has that changed your own outlook
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.080]   on building, you know, your wealth or saving?
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.560]   - We have one family that gives to us
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.040]   that I'm really inspired by.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.440]   They are a family in Texas.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.600]   They've given over $13 million to Charity Water,
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.880]   and the family caps their spending at $180,000 a year.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.920]   This is a family of four.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.720]   And that's just the number, you know,
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.960]   I think the house is paid for
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.680]   and their couple cars are paid for,
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.600]   but they just don't spend any more than $180,000 a year.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.440]   And they give away everything else,
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.520]   everything from investments,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.560]   everything from he was a successful businessman.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.880]   And I'm really inspired by that.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.280]   I appreciate the extremes that we were talking early about.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.880]   I think you've got a family member
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.440]   who's a Franciscan monk.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.840]   That is compelling to me.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.560]   I will say this, in the fundraising business,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.480]   I find sometimes people
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.360]   who have a really unhealthy view of money
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.520]   will then shame people who do have money
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.080]   and they become terrible fundraisers.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.480]   Nobody wants to be around them.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.000]   You know, you don't get invited to go on a vacation
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.640]   with somebody who has the capacity
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.680]   to give you a million dollars or $10 million, $50 million.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.720]   If you're gonna make them feel judged,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.520]   if you're gonna make them feel terrible about themselves.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.600]   Maybe it has to do with my past
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.240]   or what I was able to do in New York for 10 years,
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.480]   or just a lot of the people
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.720]   that I'm in a relationship with now at Charity Water.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.360]   I look at wealth as an opportunity
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.040]   to do more good in the world.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.840]   Wealth as an opportunity to serve,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.400]   to put that money to work in human flourishing,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.680]   in ending suffering.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.200]   And it's my job when I'm around people
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.520]   who have extraordinary wealth or middle-class wealth
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.440]   to tell compelling enough stories,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.200]   to create a compelling organization
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.560]   that can be a vehicle for turning their money
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.000]   into the transformation of human life,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.160]   and then creating a circle back to them
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.840]   so that they know it happened.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.920]   And if I can do all that,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.640]   which I've been trying to do for almost 20 years,
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.080]   you know, we find we're restoring
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.120]   a lot of people's faith in charity.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   Now, charity means love.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.200]   It's a really beautiful word that has become something
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.160]   that many people are skeptical or cynical about.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.040]   I remember when I started,
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.160]   42% of Americans polled by USA Today
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   said they didn't trust charities.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.040]   More recent, a New York University study found
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.880]   70% of Americans believe charities waste their money
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.360]   in some part, waste their donations.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.520]   So, so many of the things that we've tried to do
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.360]   at Charity Water is restore that lost faith
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   and, you know, almost get people addicted to generosity.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.320]   And it can be generosity of time.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.080]   It can be generosity of money.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.920]   It can be both.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.360]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.200]   I get it.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.880]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.760]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.840]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.760]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.720]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.640]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.400]   take care of the supplies.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.200]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.040]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.480]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.440]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.920]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.000]   that you got through another week.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.120]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.640]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.400]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.480]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.160]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.720]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.760]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.600]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.640]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.280]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.760]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.840]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.700]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.720]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.960]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.840]   Now that I have kids, I wanna be more focused at work
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.600]   so I can spend more time with them,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.720]   and I wanna have a stronger immune system
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.980]   for all the crap they bring home from school,
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.680]   which is why if you're a long-time listener,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.920]   you might know I've been drinking AG1 for about two years.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.600]   When I started drinking AG1 daily,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.200]   it was to help with daily nutrition,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.900]   but I also felt a real difference
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.680]   in the energy I had every day,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.840]   so it's been in my routine ever since.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.160]   And that's because AG1
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.080]   is a foundational nutrition supplement
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.160]   that supports your body's universal needs
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.720]   like gut optimization, stress management, and immune support.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.320]   Since 2010, AG1 has led the future
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.840]   of foundational nutrition,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   continuously refining their formula
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.600]   to create a smarter, better way
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.800]   to elevate your baseline health.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.000]   Most of all, I love that AG1 takes all the guesswork
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.320]   out of trying to combine the right supplements
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.540]   and provide multiple products in one easy scoop,
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.120]   not to mention it tastes great, especially shaken with ice,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.320]   which is why I trust it to provide my body
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.520]   the support it needs daily, and also why I'm excited
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.840]   that they've been a partner of the show for so long.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.560]   If you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.280]   it starts with AG1.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.000]   Try AG1 and get a free one-year supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.800]   and five free AG1 travel packs with your first purchase.

[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.880]   The thing that I first learned about Charity Water
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.880]   that made me realize you guys were different
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.400]   is that you have two separate sources for money, right?
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.120]   One covers all the overhead,
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.220]   all the way down to the credit card processing fees,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.880]   and then the other is just directly to go towards causes.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.160]   I mean, I think that was an intentional decision early on,
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.520]   but how much of your success
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.640]   do you think would you attribute to,
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.020]   you know, in my mind, there's two things.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.480]   You've ran it completely differently,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.700]   and then you've become masterful at storytelling,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.740]   but how do you think about those two things,
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.240]   and is maybe there another thing
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.360]   that you think drove such success?
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.320]   - That's right.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.720]   Well, yeah, when I started, I was 30.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.440]   I'd just come back from two years in Africa
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.680]   as a photojournalist,
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.360]   and I think I had the advantage, Chris,
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.480]   of not knowing anything about how to build a charity
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.400]   or run a charity,
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.720]   and I didn't really know anyone in institutional philanthropy.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.760]   I knew people who worked at Goldman Sachs or at Sephora
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.960]   or at MTV VH1 at the time, everyday people,
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.400]   and I remember actually going
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.680]   and buying "Nonprofits for Dummies," the yellow book.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.360]   How do you start a 501(c)(3)?
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.640]   What is a 501(c)(3)?
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.800]   Okay, we need some lawyers,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.600]   and you have to file this application
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.680]   with the federal government,
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.880]   and you need a board,
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.840]   and I really had no idea at the beginning,
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   but I think that then allowed me to go out
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.840]   and do just some informal market research,
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.720]   and as I talked to my friends,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.080]   they loved the noble mission
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.160]   of getting everybody on earth clean water.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.320]   I mean, everybody I talked to
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.760]   could stand for clean water for humans,
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.480]   Republicans and Democrats and people of faith
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.180]   and people who are agnostic or atheists,
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.900]   like everybody could think water is a good idea for people,
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   but really this pervasive underlying skepticism,
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.260]   everyone also seemed to have a horror story
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.020]   of a charity gone wrong,
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.060]   a charity where the money didn't get to the people
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.300]   that it was intended to get to
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.560]   or a charity where they'd hired aunts and uncles
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.900]   and distant relatives and was just racked with nepotism.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.220]   So the model for Charity Water
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.580]   really came out of just listening to everyday people.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.980]   I said, "Well, what would make you compelled to give?"
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.780]   And the 100% model just came out of that.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.140]   Well, people said, "If I knew that 100% of what I gave
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.820]   "would actually help people, I'd be more likely to give."
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.320]   I said, "All right, well, this just needs to look like
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.100]   "two separately audited bank accounts,
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.760]   "and in one bank account, I'm gonna raise my hand
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.960]   "and go try to find business leaders and entrepreneurs
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.320]   "who are not skeptical
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.480]   "and actually who wouldn't mind paying
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.980]   "those unsexy overhead costs like staff salaries
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.360]   "and office rent and phone bills
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.040]   "and the toner for the Epson copy machine
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.400]   "if they knew we were efficient
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.080]   "with those donations and transparent."
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.160]   And then I can go out to the public and say,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.980]   "Great, not your problem.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.320]   "If you give a dollar or a million dollars,
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.240]   "every single penny, every dollar will go directly
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.360]   "to build these water projects
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.120]   "which get people clean water."
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.320]   And as you mentioned, so that there would be
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.920]   kinda perfect integrity with the 100% model,
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.280]   we said, "We'll even pay back your credit card fees.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.040]   "If you give 100 bucks on your Amex, sadly, we get 96,
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.600]   "but we will pay that $4 back from the overhead account
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.000]   "and we'll send your $100 to the field."
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.720]   And then the second thing that came out of listening was
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.920]   people wanted just to see where their money went.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.080]   So we said, "All right, well, we're gonna prove
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.000]   "where this money goes.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.440]   "Money's not fungible.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.920]   "We can build technology in the water bank account
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.960]   "where all the public is giving towards
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   "and we could track a $92 donation to a well in Malawi
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.040]   "or $114 donation to a spring protection in Nepal."
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.140]   And we actually became the first charity in the world
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.600]   just to geolocate all of our completed water projects
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.880]   up on Google Earth and then later Google Maps.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.000]   So there was this theme of hyper-transparency,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.480]   but again, could we wrap that with a story?
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.160]   And then the third pillar was just this belief that,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.480]   yeah, I remember looking around the sector and saying,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.780]   "Where are the apples of charity?
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.360]   "Where's the Nike?
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.000]   "Where's the Virgin?"
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.180]   Or later, "Where's the Tesla?
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:13.180]   "Where are these inspiring, imaginative, creative brands
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.360]   "that capture the imagination of people?"
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.660]   And I saw a lot of shame and guilt-based marketing.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.440]   I saw a lot of charities with bad websites
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.120]   and terrible checkout forms
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.760]   and PDFs that they expected people to read,
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.000]   white papers about their issue.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.100]   So I think this just came through listing
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.660]   and these became really core distinctives for Charity Water,
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.160]   the 100% model, always looking for ways
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.680]   to connect people to their money, proving it,
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.600]   trying to build this really inspiring,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.700]   design-forward brand.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.020]   And then maybe the most important thing
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.360]   was really what we wouldn't do.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.240]   We wouldn't send anyone that looked like me
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.400]   over to Africa or India or Southeast Asia to go drill wells.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.680]   And I believed just from day one
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.160]   for this work to be culturally appropriate,
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   for it to be sustainable in the long run,
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.080]   it had to be led by the locals
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.280]   in each of these countries where we worked.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.980]   And if we were successful,
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.680]   we would help grow the teams of local hydrogeologists
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.320]   and local well drillers and technicians.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   And as we scaled, we would create thousands of local jobs
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.280]   in the process and they would be the ones
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.320]   leading their communities and leading their countries
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.200]   forward in the future.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.560]   They'd also be the ones getting the credit.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.720]   And that's maybe what I've been really most proud of.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.380]   17 years later, we employ well over 2,500 people
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.520]   through our partner network now across 21 active countries.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.360]   And they are taking the money that we're raising
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.120]   and turning it into clean water for the people
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.880]   living in their communities and their countries
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.420]   every single day.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.680]   So just to kind of finish on this, day one,
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.280]   I put all these things together and my best idea
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.000]   for the launch of Charity Water
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.180]   was to get a nightclub donated during fashion week
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.240]   and to get open bar donated
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.840]   and then to just email everyone I knew
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.600]   and invite them to my 31st birthday party.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.520]   And 700 people came, probably less for me,
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.560]   more for the club and the open bar.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.640]   And on their way in, we put out this big plexi box
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.620]   and they had to drop $20 in the box to get in the club.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.080]   And at the end of the night, we'd collected $15,000.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.240]   And we took 100% of the money
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.040]   to a refugee camp in Northern Uganda.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.680]   We built our very first well.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.000]   And then we sent the photo proof and the GPS coordinates
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.600]   and the satellite images back to the 700 people who came.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.960]   And we said, you came, you gave $20, it mattered.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   And here, watch, see, see the impact you made.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.280]   And I mean, that sounds so simple,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.220]   but nobody else was doing that at the time.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.920]   And it turned out to be such a competitive advantage
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.160]   in the early days.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.800]   - You had no experience in this space
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.440]   and have built, you know, not the biggest,
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.800]   but definitely one of the most innovative charities
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.920]   that I'm familiar with.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.640]   I wanna jump into a few lessons
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.360]   because it seems like, wow, you just did this one thing
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.440]   and then it took off from there.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.180]   I know you've had your fair share of setbacks along the way.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.260]   So you were passionate about this space,
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.280]   but I know that takes patience and resilience.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.640]   How do you handle that?
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.540]   And then what advice would you give to people
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.000]   who are dealing with similar things in life,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.960]   whether it's charities or anything,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.240]   just to build that resilience in their own pursuits?
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.440]   - Well, a lot of things didn't work.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.280]   I remember, you know, the 100% model sounds great
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.680]   until you run out of people
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.720]   who are willing to pay for overhead.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.380]   So we had this moment about a year and a half in
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.360]   where we were raising so much money
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.960]   for clean water projects
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.460]   'cause the 100% model was resonating
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.920]   with the everyday public,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.960]   but I just couldn't find people
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   to hire that next incremental staff member soon enough.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.160]   And I'll never remember,
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.720]   there was this really pivotal moment.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.000]   We had $881,000 in the water bank account
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.120]   that was headed out to the field to build projects.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.060]   And we had a couple weeks left
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.080]   in the overhead account to make payroll.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.520]   And I remember the advice I was getting from people
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.680]   was to go borrow against the 881K.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.160]   You know, write a little IOU
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.480]   and transfer between accounts
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.760]   'cause you gotta pay your people
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.880]   and, you know, you'll figure this out later.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.840]   And I remember calling lawyers
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.960]   and I was gonna start to unwind the charity
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.240]   and just say, this doesn't work.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.640]   This is an untenable model.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.160]   You know, I guess unless you have
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.800]   a huge amount of capital to start with
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.880]   or a billionaire backer.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.860]   But I remember thinking if we borrowed one penny
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.040]   of the public's money and violated that promise,
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.440]   even if we paid it back later,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.480]   there would just be a crack
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.440]   in the foundation of our integrity.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.400]   And I didn't wanna run that organization.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.640]   I would rather fail and try again
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.360]   with maybe the traditional business model
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.040]   where you put all the money in one account.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   And we were very fortunate at that time.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.360]   I met a young entrepreneur in Silicon Valley
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.720]   and I remember taking a meeting with him.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.120]   He was interested in what we were doing.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.840]   And I remember thinking the meeting went terribly.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.120]   And at the end of the meeting,
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.960]   he asked for our bank account details.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.520]   And then three days later,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.960]   he shot me a note well after midnight saying,
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.320]   I enjoyed meeting you.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.480]   You know, really love the passion, love the work.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.960]   I just wired a million dollars into your overhead account.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.720]   And we went from insolvent,
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.760]   weeks away from insolvency
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.200]   to over a year of operating capital.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.040]   And we really never looked back.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.900]   Had that not happened,
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.360]   I'm probably not having this conversation with you.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.560]   And what helped me so much was I think,
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.600]   one, I fell back on our values
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.320]   and I would have been proud to hold my head high
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.720]   and shut the organization down
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.080]   and just say this didn't work,
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.680]   but at least not compromise.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.520]   And besides the money, that million dollars,
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.640]   which was so needed at the time,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.760]   it was also that somebody believed in me.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.000]   He believed that this was a tenable model.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.760]   We just needed more time.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.360]   We needed more time to work it out.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.540]   And today, there are 131 families who pay the overhead.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.140]   And that grows every single year.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.300]   We invite 10 or 15 new people in.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.400]   And we've never really looked back after that moment,
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.440]   after that time that forced us to be creative.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.140]   It forced us to come up with a multi-year,
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:29.060]   multi-tier operations giving program.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.880]   And now we have so many people
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.040]   that actually prefer to give that way.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.080]   They would prefer to support a software engineer
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.160]   or a UI/UX designer than actually give directly
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.480]   to the water projects.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.800]   - Now can you give money the other way?
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.520]   If you have too much in the overhead,
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.160]   do you just save it for the rainy day?
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.440]   - Well, we never have too much in the overhead, Chris.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.940]   We never have too much in the overhead.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.040]   It's always a slightly harder proposition,
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.800]   but all that to say, we're not going bankrupt.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.440]   We're always trying to grow that group.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.200]   That is where all the growth capital comes from.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.880]   So unless we grow the amount of people
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.160]   who are willing to give on that side,
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.440]   we can't grow the team.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.160]   We really can't grow the scale of the organization.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.720]   But I think in resiliency,
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.840]   you're talking about staying the course.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.260]   So we're 17 years in,
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.520]   and we've now helped 17.4 million people
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.820]   get access to clean water,
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.680]   about 137,000 villages around the world.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.720]   On my bad days, I try to fill Madison Square Garden
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.360]   with 17 million people.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.680]   And you would have to build
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.760]   about a thousand Madison Square Gardens.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.800]   So, you know, Charity Water has sold out
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.760]   Staple Center or the Garden or, you know,
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.280]   O2 Arena in London about a thousand times
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.280]   to contain the amount of people who now have water.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.800]   99% of my time, I put that 17 million
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.840]   against the 700 million, and it's 1/40.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.760]   It's two and a half percent of the way to goal
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.900]   because goal really is creating a world
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.280]   where no one drinks disgusting water.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.240]   No human being alive, as we're recording a podcast,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.520]   is risking their life, is poisoning themselves
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.720]   simply because of the environment they were born into.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.400]   And especially because we know how to solve this problem.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.360]   That's what makes this both wonderful and energizing
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.240]   and also frustrating is there are a lot of problems, Chris,
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.480]   we don't know how to solve.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.560]   My mom eventually died of pancreatic cancer.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.520]   It was four months from diagnosis to death.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.480]   They had absolutely no idea how to help her.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.280]   We don't know how to solve ALS
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.560]   or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's yet.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.000]   We know how to solve water for people.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.520]   There's not a single one of the 700 million people out there
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.400]   where we're scratching our heads saying,
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.000]   "I just couldn't help them."
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.360]   Wouldn't know how to get them water.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.040]   Now, we haven't created the will to solve the problem.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.520]   We haven't allocated the resources to solve the problem,
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.200]   but we actually know how to do it.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.920]   So, you know, I really kind of believe
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.060]   the best is yet to come.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.060]   I remember looking at a 27-year stock chart of Amazon.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   And the quote was, "Had Jeff Bezos quit in year 20,
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.840]   he'd only created 7% of the company's value.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   93% came in years 21 through 27."
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.840]   That number may even be bigger now as a ratio,
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   maybe five and 95.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.280]   So I think there is an animating idea
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.680]   of just continuing to show up.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.040]   And we're in year 17 now.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   And you never know who is waiting, who is watching.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.080]   We still don't have a single philanthropist of note
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.280]   in the entire world who has raised their hand and said,
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.040]   "Hey, I'm gonna work on water."
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.380]   Y'all are working on health and education
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.480]   and women and girls and gender equality
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.920]   and economic development.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.240]   You know what, I found the one thing that sits underneath
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.600]   almost every problem related to extreme poverty,
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.760]   and that's water.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.120]   So I'm gonna take that on.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.080]   We still don't have that.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.720]   You know, there is no Bloomberg, Gates, Elon, Bezos.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   There's nobody who's kind of raised their hand.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.800]   No corporation has raised their hand
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.440]   and made any sort of significant commitment towards this
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.200]   or really moved the needle forward.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.560]   So I think as we just, you know, keep our heads down
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.360]   and every year, you know, try to grow the organization,
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.160]   grow our community, grow our impact,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.120]   we put ourselves in a situation where hopefully
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.840]   we build trust, we build credibility,
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.520]   we build the systems and the infrastructure now,
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.640]   you know, across over 20 countries
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.400]   to be able to absorb that future interest in water
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.080]   and hopefully the future capital that comes to this space.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.960]   - I think part of the reason I am so compelled
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.120]   by the story of Charity Water is your ability to tell it,
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.720]   both here, in video, on your website.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.800]   Did you know how important that aspect would be
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.040]   to your success when you started?
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.280]   - I didn't, I didn't.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.960]   And I think it's a little bit innate.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.040]   I don't think in statistics, you know, they don't move me.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.520]   I really think in stories, and I'm also a visual thinker.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.840]   You know, I took photos early on with Charity Water.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.920]   Now we have far better, more accomplished photographers
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.880]   who are willing to often donate their time
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.240]   and go out and document this work.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.960]   But I think I've realized the power of it over the years.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.160]   I'll give you an example.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.880]   I wrote this chapter in my book,
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.160]   which was probably the most moving and devastating story
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.800]   for me over 17 years.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.400]   And if I gave you the statistics,
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.280]   okay, 700 million people in the world don't have water.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.720]   Women are walking hundreds of millions of hours
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.520]   every year that they're wasting.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.160]   Up to 50% of the disease in many of these countries
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.800]   is caused simply by bad water.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   Half the schools throughout the developing world
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.360]   don't have water or toilets for their students, right?
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.640]   I mean, I could statistic after statistic,
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.160]   but if I told you that I was in Northern Ethiopia once
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   and somebody came up to me in a $5 a night hotel room lobby,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.720]   kind of the restaurant lobby and said,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.440]   "Hey, you're the Charity Water guy.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.280]   We've heard of you.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.600]   We know the impact you're making up here.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.920]   Let me tell you a story."
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.800]   He sits down and he says, "I'm from a remote village.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.680]   The women in my village,
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.960]   they used to all walk eight hours a day."
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.040]   And he goes, "There was this one woman
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.640]   and at the end of one of her walks,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.000]   before she got home, she slipped and she fell
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.800]   and all the water that she just walked for
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.880]   spilled out into the ground.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.640]   And she had this clay pot on her back
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.080]   and the clay pot shattered.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.040]   And there were shards all over the path."
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.600]   And he said, "She didn't go get another pot.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.480]   She didn't go back and go refill the water."
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.520]   He said, "She took a rope and she climbed a tree
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.160]   and she tied a noose around her neck and she hung herself.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.760]   They're in the center of my village.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.680]   And we found her body swinging from a tree."
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.400]   And he let that sit.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.840]   And he said, "The work you're doing is important."
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.200]   And he walked back into the kitchen.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.280]   I remember thinking at first, "That's not true.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.560]   That's what you tell the humanitarian aid worker
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.720]   to make us feel great
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.360]   about the work we're doing in the country."
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.240]   But I think the power of story, you know, that nagged at me.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.560]   And a couple months later, I told my wife, I said,
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.760]   "I need to go and see if this is true.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.640]   I need to go and see if this woman lived.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.800]   And I need to see the tree."
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.880]   And I wound up flying back to Ethiopia
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.720]   and flying up to the north and then driving four hours,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.320]   got to the end of the road,
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.280]   renting a donkey and a camel
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.360]   and putting a little backpack and tent,
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.080]   and then walking nine hours over the mountains
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.280]   to reach this village.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.240]   It was called Meda.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.800]   And over the next week, I lived in this village
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.680]   and I walked in her footsteps and I met her mother
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.520]   and I met her best friend
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.760]   who walked for water with her that day.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.000]   And they'd kind of split at the end of the walk,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.240]   her friend going to her house.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:45.600]   And her name was Leta Kiros, walking towards her house.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.640]   And what I didn't know until I lived in this village
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.960]   was that she was 13 years old when she died.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.720]   I was imagining someone towards the end of her life
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.320]   when she was described to me as a woman.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.120]   She was a teenage girl.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.840]   And I saw where she got her water.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.320]   I visited her grave.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.600]   I talked to the priest who gave her ceremony.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.840]   I interviewed her friends who told me what she was like.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.680]   She had vision.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.000]   She wanted to get out of this village.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.920]   She wanted to become a doctor, a nurse to help people.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.480]   And I remember just standing next to the tree,
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.000]   which was this frail little tree
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.720]   and there was a dirt path that ran next to the tree,
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.640]   imagining a 13-year-old girl's body hanging
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.240]   with a noose around her neck
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.240]   and water off in the dust and shards of clay pot.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.760]   And it angered me.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   I came back with a driving desire to do more
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.120]   because kids shouldn't be hanging themselves
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.880]   because they were born in a village without water.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.200]   And I remember the last thing just about this story,
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   what struck me as I thought of, well, this is a tough story.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.760]   I almost need to be careful telling the story.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.880]   But I asked her best friend, I said,
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.840]   "Why do you think she took her life?"
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.240]   And her friend said, this is through a translator
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.280]   in the local language, Tigrinya.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.240]   Her friend said, "Shame."
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   Because it was her role
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.200]   to go and get the water for the family.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.360]   And not only had she let the family down
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.120]   through her carelessness, slipping and falling,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:23.080]   she'd also broken the clay pot, which was a valuable asset.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.680]   And the shame of her failure
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.480]   would have been probably too much
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.640]   for her to go back and face her family.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:34.800]   So there's statistics and then there is the story
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.080]   of a real life person
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.160]   who's just one of those 703 million people
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.640]   that certainly resonated with me.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.280]   I was able to connect to the idea of shame.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.840]   I was able to connect to futility,
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.760]   to a situation that you just don't know how to get out of.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.440]   So you just have to keep doing it every single day.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.440]   And wanting, Chris, to be a part of that answer
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.160]   to the next 13-year-old girl that I could get to.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.000]   - Makes me wanna make sure
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.360]   if there's not a well in that village,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.520]   can we start, do a fundraiser to put a well in that village?
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.840]   I'm hoping there already is.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.640]   - This is years ago.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.720]   - Okay.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.800]   So I hear you, the storytelling there
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.240]   pales in comparison to the numbers.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.000]   And when I think about my own ability to storytell,
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.600]   I think you're far superior and I need to work on that.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.720]   Is that something you learned?
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.120]   Is that something that was practiced?
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.520]   How can you draw people in?
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.720]   - I go to the movies a lot by myself.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.960]   I think we're creatures of story.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.360]   My wife was laughing at me the other day.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.280]   I spent three and a half hours alone
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.480]   in the new Scorsese movie because I grew up
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.120]   and I did a couple of years in film school
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.160]   and he's a great storyteller.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.040]   So I'm constantly trying to immerse myself in stories
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.880]   that have nothing to do with Charity Water,
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.560]   but watch people who are masters of the craft.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.680]   There's no formula.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.840]   I mean, I'm never sitting down and like saying this,
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.960]   then that, then this, you know, the hero's journey,
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.960]   or I've never read Joseph Campbell's work.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.800]   I mean, I'm familiar kind of
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.760]   with the idea of the hero's journey,
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.160]   but I'm a chronological thinker.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.120]   So it's kind of this, then that, then this,
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.720]   then that, then this.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.320]   I feel like just because I put everybody
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.720]   on such a downer there, I'll tell just one other kind
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.080]   of story in the opposite end of that.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.600]   One of my favorites over the years,
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.720]   and we have so many stories, myriad stories
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.080]   that we've come across of just extraordinary people
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:29.000]   and extraordinary lives impacted by not having water,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.840]   impacted by having water.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.480]   There's this woman named Helen
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.280]   that we met in Northern Uganda.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.800]   And Helen was kind of the end of middle age,
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.400]   and she was a mom, she had a bunch of kids.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.720]   And our team was visiting Charity Water Completed Projects.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.880]   And when the community knows you're coming,
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.520]   Chris, there's a lot of fanfare.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.920]   I mean, they roll out the red carpet,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.760]   they're bringing goats and chickens and eggs,
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.440]   and there are speeches, and there's dancing,
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.480]   and there's singing.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.680]   There's a real honoring of the people who have come
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.960]   just to learn more about the community.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.440]   So the team had done four with fanfare,
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.320]   and this was like the fifth at the end of the day.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.720]   And they were trying to sneak into this village
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.480]   just to see the water point in action
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.880]   and kind of almost sneak up on it and say,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.080]   "Hey, were people using it?
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.120]   "And what did it feel like around the well?"
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.240]   Well, Helen had somehow gotten wind.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.440]   So she leads this welcoming party of women,
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.960]   and they're dancing, and they're singing,
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.520]   and they're welcoming the team in.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.840]   And after that stops, we sit down with Helen,
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.720]   and we said, "Just tell us your story.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.800]   "Now you have water.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.880]   "It's feet from your home.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.200]   "How is your life different now?"
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.440]   And Helen begins to tell us the story
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.120]   of what her life was like before.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.920]   She used to go get 10 gallons of water,
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.280]   so two kind of big yellow jugs.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.080]   Think of what you've got in your garage
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.760]   for your riding mower or the little gas tank.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.920]   And she would carry two of these,
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.080]   very heavy, 40 pounds each.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.760]   And she said, "Because the water was so far away,
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.600]   "I always had to make these choices.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:56.600]   "There's never enough water,
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.320]   "so what would I do with the water today?"
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.760]   And then she listed, "Well, I could cook.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.080]   "I could clean.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.400]   "I could garden.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.440]   "I could wash my kids' bodies.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.000]   "I could wash my kids' school uniforms."
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.080]   And she said, "There was just never enough water."
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.120]   And she said, "As a Ugandan woman,
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.320]   "we put our families first."
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   She said, "Now that I have clean water,
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.960]   "feet from my house," she said this.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.600]   She said, "Now I am beautiful."
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.840]   And our team didn't quite get it.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.680]   We're like, "Helen, of course,
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.280]   "you're this beautiful Ugandan woman."
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.920]   And she goes, "No, I don't think you understand."
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.040]   She goes, "Now I finally, for the first time in my life,
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.480]   "in this village, have enough water to wash my face
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.200]   "and my body and my clothes."
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.800]   And she said, "I am beautiful."
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.880]   She said, "Look at me, I'm looking so smart."
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   And we'd never quite thought of water in that way before,
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.800]   until we sat down with a woman
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.520]   and just listened to her simply tell her story.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.760]   And water to her meant dignity.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.200]   Water meant beauty.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.360]   We'd been talking about water as health
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.680]   and rattling off statistics of disease
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.480]   and water is educated.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:07.240]   Water to her meant something deeply personal.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:12.880]   And when I tell that story, for me,
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.680]   it also, what an extraordinary thing
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.240]   to be able to give a woman, especially a woman
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.000]   who is sacrificially giving for her family.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.160]   She wasn't using the water for herself.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.080]   She was using her limited water
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.880]   that she was walking hours for, for others,
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.280]   for the benefit of others.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.360]   And now she finally had enough to take care of herself.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.000]   I mean, who doesn't wanna be a part of that?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.120]   - I feel like what you've just given everyone listening
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.360]   is not only an incredible story about water
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.840]   and the impact it can have,
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.840]   but an example of how taking the time to pull stories,
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.560]   whether it's from your life,
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.120]   whether it's from the lives of people that you work with,
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.160]   the companies you work with,
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.760]   and turning them into something
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.200]   that's more than set of figures or facts.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.680]   And I so often default to the transactional information,
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.480]   like, oh, water could give someone this, this, this, this.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   And I just need to stop and pause in the future
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.720]   and really realize that taking the time to tell that story,
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.200]   which you'd think as someone who talks to a microphone
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.640]   for a living would innately have as a common practice.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.560]   But I just think if there's a lesson
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.480]   that I've taken away from the last few minutes,
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.360]   it's just how powerful that can be
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.480]   and how it's not limited to someone in your role.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.280]   It's not a skill that only matters
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.600]   if you're raising money for charity.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.960]   It's something that probably matters in all aspects of life.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.800]   - That's right.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.520]   I mean, some of the greatest entrepreneurs are storytellers.
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.560]   It has to be true.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.400]   I'll say that, Chris.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.240]   It has to be true.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.840]   I mean, I think sometimes there can be over embellishment
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.720]   and people can get really carried away.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.720]   So a story is powerful when it is true.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.000]   And often the details in a story make it true.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.680]   It would not have been true for me
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   had I not lived in Leta Quiros's village,
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.240]   had I not stood next to that tree,
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.680]   had I not walked in her footsteps down the ravine,
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.640]   had I not talked to the other women
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.400]   at that same source of water.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.720]   So for me, the proximity and the immersion
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.920]   to the story was really important.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.080]   And then the details emerge from those,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.160]   which can really move people
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.240]   because the details also remind people
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.080]   that it's true, you know what I mean?
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.560]   It's not a general, the specificity.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.760]   You know, Helen, I mean, I have a picture of her in her dress.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.280]   So if I were to do this on stage,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.760]   I would show you Helen dancing
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.120]   and I would show you the two yellow cans.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.880]   And then I would show you a portrait we took of Helen
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.480]   as she is radiantly beaming.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.680]   And you would look at her green kind of paisley dress
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.320]   and you would notice, wow, it really does look clean.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.800]   I can't see any dirt on that.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.080]   So I think showing as well as telling
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.080]   is often really, really important.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.200]   - And it's not just for story.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.600]   I mean, let's take an example
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.680]   because you've taken a lot of these stories
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.000]   and made videos, put them on the site.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.800]   I'm referencing one in particular
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.480]   that you happened to share before we got started.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.920]   The financial impact to the organization
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.840]   of telling these stories is also great.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.360]   So it's not just storytelling for storytelling sake.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.000]   The time you spend in that village,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.960]   which I think sometimes comes across as not from you,
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.920]   but like you're brainstorming these ideas
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.200]   and you're like, do I really want to spend
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.920]   a week of my life collecting a story?
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.520]   And I think one thing I've taken from our conversations,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.480]   the value of that story could be even greater
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.280]   than the time you spent collecting it.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.120]   - I agree.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.000]   Look, stories can move people.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.560]   I mean, I really think about storytelling is,
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.480]   is this story gonna bring out something valuable
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.320]   in the people that might encounter it?
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.480]   I'll just give you one other example.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.560]   We'll probably talk about the film
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.200]   that the people could go to actually see
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.040]   some of these images,
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.760]   but there's a famous donor story
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.400]   where there was a nine-year-old girl
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.600]   named Rachel Beckwith in Seattle, Washington.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.120]   And she saw me talk.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.480]   And at the time I would ask everyone in the audience
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.080]   to donate their next birthday to Charity Water.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.280]   And I'd say, you don't need any more stuff.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.840]   You don't need toys.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.520]   You know, women, you don't need handbags.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.760]   Guys, you don't need wallets.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.520]   Like we have enough stuff.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.560]   Humans don't even have water.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.520]   So turn your birthday into a giving moment.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.120]   And I thought the sticky marketing message would be,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.080]   ask for your age in dollars.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.640]   So if you're turning nine, ask everyone for $9.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.400]   If you're turning 89, ask everyone for $89.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.960]   And Rachel took me seriously at this
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.280]   and she donates her ninth birthday
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.440]   and she sets a goal of $300,
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.320]   which was gonna help the time 10 people get access to water.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.080]   And she cancels her birthday party,
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.840]   won't accept gifts, and she raises $220.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.600]   So she falls short in her goal and she tells her mom,
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.120]   she feels like she's failed
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.520]   and she's gonna try harder next year.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.440]   And her mom's like, hey, I think you're pretty awesome.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.400]   I mean, you raised $220 and just,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.480]   you care so much about people you've never met
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.880]   living an ocean away.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.400]   I mean, we should all be inspired by you.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.000]   Well, right after her birthday, she dies in a car crash.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.080]   There's a 25 car pile up on an interstate in Seattle.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.880]   She's the only fatality.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.960]   Tractor trailer, jackknifes.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960]   Her mom was driving, her sister was in the front.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.600]   She was smashed in the backseat.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.720]   And I was in Africa at the time.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.960]   I was in Central African Republic.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.920]   I remember landing the next day at JFK,
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.440]   turning on my phone, the BlackBerry at the time.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.840]   And her pastor had emailed me to let me know
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.360]   of this little girl in his Seattle congregation
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.920]   who had donated her birthday,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.440]   had raised $220 and then had passed away.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.040]   And he asked me, could we reopen her campaign?
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.080]   And he was gonna just ask everybody in the church
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.840]   to donate $9.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.880]   Long story short, people get wind of this campaign
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.120]   and a lot of people, Chris, donate $9.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.200]   And it spreads to the New York Times
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.320]   and Nick Kristof picks it up.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.040]   It spreads to the morning shows,
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.080]   starts spreading to Europe.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.040]   And then one of the coolest things
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.040]   was people in Africa start donating $9 in Rachel's name.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.880]   She goes from $220 to $1.3 million in donations.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.240]   She inspired almost 60,000 complete strangers to give.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.080]   And what was even cooler was so many of those givers
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.240]   then went on to donate their next birthday
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.080]   that inspired by this sacrificial nine-year-old girl
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.600]   who really should want toys or whatever the thing
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.480]   that a nine-year-old should want for themselves.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.720]   I think it so inspired 60,000 people.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.040]   They said, not only can we give to honor her last wish,
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.240]   but we could also follow the lead of a nine-year-old girl.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.080]   That story, as tragic as it is,
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.680]   has put so much good into the world.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.880]   Beyond the 100,000 people that now have clean water.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.480]   I mean, she wanted to help 10 people while alive.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.120]   She's now brought clean water to well over 100,000 people.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.560]   Actually got to take her mom and her grandparents
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.360]   on the one-year anniversary of her death,
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.480]   took them to Ethiopia and they went village to village
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.760]   to village to village.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.680]   And they personally met thousands of people
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.320]   who had clean water because of their daughter,
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   because of their granddaughter.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.480]   But I think that story is good in the world.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.960]   And maybe people have heard that story,
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.720]   didn't even donate a birthday to Charity Water,
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.400]   they donated it for some other cause or for cancer research
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.320]   or to build a school.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.960]   - I know the part of this story that changed for you
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.400]   was when you started, when you took this trip
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.320]   and you just talked about taking Rachel's family on a trip.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.720]   How much of the perspective from travel
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.080]   and seeing people in other cultures and other circumstances
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.960]   has given you the perspective and gratitude you have
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.800]   and how valuable do you think that is as a mechanism
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.640]   for changing anyone's perspective?
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.400]   - Chris, I get asked a lot having done this
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.440]   for close to 20 years, what keeps you going?
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.280]   How can you still get up and just do this
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.880]   day in and day out?
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.520]   The travel is a piece.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.360]   So I make sure it's never too long
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.960]   before I am on the ground in these communities,
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.200]   connecting with the people we are hoping to serve
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.600]   and the people we're serving.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.400]   So that grounds me, it roots me.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.040]   I've been to Africa more than 55 times now.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.920]   I've been to 72 countries around the world
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.240]   and living in these villages,
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.440]   I just got to take my six and eight-year-old
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.880]   this March for the first time to Uganda,
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.280]   which is where Charity Water's first well was.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.600]   And I had my kids carrying water.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   I had my kids asking questions of communities
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.480]   and my kids are born into a middle-class life.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.160]   They will never have to drink dirty water
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.960]   as long as they live.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.040]   And I wanted to share that experience with them as well.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.800]   I got to bring some of our major donors' kids
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.440]   as well on that trip and it was just really impactful.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.400]   So for me, it is very, very important.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.840]   Bryan Stevenson at EGI talks a lot about proximity.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.120]   You know, there's a power, there's a credibility
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.800]   that comes when you are in proximity to your issue,
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.000]   you know, to the passion and the purpose.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.880]   I had that proximity for the first two years,
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.320]   you know, on that mercy ship,
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.600]   embedded with these doctors.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.360]   I had the proximity because I was scrubbed up
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.240]   with a camera in an eight-and-a-half-hour surgery,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.200]   watching them remove a tumor
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.880]   or put somebody's body back together
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.720]   who had been burned by rebel soldiers during the war.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.560]   That has helped.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.320]   So I'm always looking for that
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.520]   and trying to make sure that I'm never too far away
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.160]   from the issue that I'm advocating for
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.680]   with the people who were serving.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.120]   - And obviously, travel to Africa with kids
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.320]   is a big trip that not everyone can take.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.440]   What other things are you doing as a father
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.640]   or even for yourself to kind of create that culture
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   of gratitude, of selflessness, of generosity,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.440]   of giving in your family?
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.000]   - I like that you started with gratitude
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.120]   because that is the one practice
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.800]   that I am very faithful to with the kids.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.640]   So we play the gratitude game every night.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.840]   We go around.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.440]   If I'm doing bedtime alone without my wife, it's 30.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.440]   So everybody's got to do 10 and you can have one repeat.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.320]   So we're looking at 27 unique things
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.920]   that we're grateful for every single night.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.520]   And sometimes if it's an early bedtime,
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.840]   I'll push them to do 20.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.280]   And just to practice.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.320]   And sometimes you get like, I'm thankful for mom,
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.480]   I'm thankful for the dog, I'm thankful for our house,
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.880]   I'm thankful for church, I'm thankful for, you know.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.840]   But I've gotten some unbelievably creative,
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.200]   really profound things out of the kids
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.440]   and I think even out of myself.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.080]   Things that have kind of surprised me
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.040]   when you really go into that posture of gratitude.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.280]   So that is a practice that I think has really enriched
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.680]   the lives of our family.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.640]   You know, I think, right, not everybody can take a trip.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.120]   And I mean, we got back, my wife's like,
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.480]   I'm never doing that again.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.360]   I mean, seven flights in seven days, time zones,
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.000]   14 hours on Emirates through Dubai, you know.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:13.840]   - In coach?
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.840]   - In the back of the bus was, oh bro, all coach, yeah.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.840]   Actually, that was seven out in back in coach with kids.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.960]   It was rough.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.160]   But we would have not traded that experience.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.920]   And of course, we would have done it again.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.680]   I think my wife would have done it again too.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.760]   - Well, when it comes to the charitable world,
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.800]   I feel like I don't have the perspective you do
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.000]   and you've gotten to know this industry
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.720]   probably much more than most people.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.280]   I'm curious, as people think about causes
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.520]   they wanna support, obviously, you know,
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.600]   you'll encourage them to take a look at what you're doing
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.760]   and I will as well.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.800]   What advice do you have for people when they find a cause
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.880]   and actually finding the right organization?
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.520]   As much as I love the 100% model,
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.920]   I think it's fairly unique.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.960]   And so finding the right organizations can be tough.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.080]   And I know in the recent past with different disasters
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.320]   and, you know, war zones, people have, you know,
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.640]   made these lists of 20 different organizations,
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.320]   but it seems very hard to kind of evaluate an organization
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.600]   in the nonprofit sector.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.160]   - I think it starts with finding causes
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.320]   that you're passionate about,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.800]   learning about those causes,
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.560]   maybe more than what you're asking chat GPT
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.680]   or browsing one article,
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.840]   educating yourself on these causes
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.040]   and then trying to research organizations
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.480]   that are well-run and are transparent.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.240]   I certainly do not think, in fact,
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.040]   I don't even advocate other people starting charities
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.840]   to adopt the 100% model.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.600]   It was right for us 17 years ago,
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.440]   it continues to be right for us going forward.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.600]   But what I really was trying to say back then
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.680]   is people just wanna know where their money's going.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.280]   They want transparency in that.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.120]   If I told your listeners today
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.280]   that the greatest need at Charity Water
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   was a new expensive copy machine,
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.840]   because we needed to print a bunch of paper copies
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.640]   and, you know, it was gonna be $3,000 or something.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.480]   People would donate for a copy machine to meet a need,
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.720]   to meet a specific need if they knew
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.240]   how that would move the mission forward.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.080]   We don't need a copy machine, but, you know,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.200]   you could argue that'd be like the unsexiest cost ever
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.800]   is like something that prints paper.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.240]   But if those papers were valuable
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.960]   to the continuation of the mission, people would step up.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.600]   It's often, I think, the opacity,
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.240]   it's the not knowing where the money goes.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.800]   You know, it's the fine print during many of the disasters
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.760]   where you find out actually $100 million
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.720]   that was given went into an endowment,
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.760]   which won't see the light of day
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.200]   because in that fine print,
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.120]   the organizations say, "Well, if we over-raise
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.880]   what we can spend, you know,
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.960]   we can do anything with this money."
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.600]   I remember to that end, there was a very famous example
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.920]   years ago during the tsunami, I believe it was,
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.320]   where Doctors Without Borders over-raised significantly
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.880]   and they tried to refund everybody's money.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.480]   And they tried to say, "Here, take your money back.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.000]   We got what we needed.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.720]   Can't spend it in this intended way."
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.360]   And what do you think 99% of people did?
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.800]   Said, "Keep the money, but thank you for telling us."
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.720]   You know, so that move would have built so much trust
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.400]   because it was integrity in that move.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.280]   There was transparency in that move.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.960]   And I think that's often what is lacking sometimes
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.400]   in the sector where when you really follow the dollars,
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.080]   you're not always thrilled with what happened with them.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.120]   - How would the average person go through that process?
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.520]   Like what would you practically do?
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.440]   Let's say there's a tsunami.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.200]   - You'd read a 990, which is one.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.040]   So you read a 990.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.240]   I mean, every organization publishes their 990
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.640]   so you can see how they're spending their money,
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.800]   how much on marketing, how much on office costs.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.480]   You can really see where the money is going out.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.000]   That's one document.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.040]   I mean, there are a lot of organizations
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.440]   that don't put that up online.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.320]   So that's one flag.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.920]   Somebody sent me due diligence.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.240]   "Oh, check out this organization."
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.160]   I said, "Well, they've been around for seven years.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.920]   They haven't posted a single financial online."
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.320]   You know, that's not even legal.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.480]   So a charity is forced to publish their federal file.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.760]   It's like your tax return.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.600]   Every single year.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.080]   And that needs to be found online.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.920]   So there's actually a lot of just simple best practices
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.000]   that aren't happening.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.480]   I'm a big Dan Pallotta fan.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.440]   If people don't know him,
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.720]   he gave a very famous TED talk on kind of the overhead myth.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.280]   He wrote a book called "Uncharitable."
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.680]   He's got a film coming out in the next month or so.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.240]   And I am not an advocate for these tiny overheads.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.600]   I'm really an advocate for well-run, efficient organizations
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.000]   who are growing their impact,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.880]   who are trying to put more and more money out into the field
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.000]   or directly to the cause.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.320]   And that is driving everything at the organization.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.560]   The Wounded Warriors story is probably the most famous.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.320]   I remember they were much vilified for a long time.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   And I sat with Steve Nardizzi once,
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.560]   who was their kind of co-founder.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.080]   And the way that he explained it to me was so simple.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.560]   He said, "I took this organization over
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.440]   and we were raising $8 million a year for veterans."
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.760]   And I might get this slightly wrong,
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.920]   but he said $8 million was not even a fraction of what was needed.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.280]   And I learned that every dollar I would put into marketing,
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.440]   I could return about 50 cents.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.120]   So that sounds, whoa, horribly inefficient.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.680]   But he said, "I wanted to market and grow the organization.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.160]   And then I would kind of worry about efficiency later
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.120]   when we got up to scale."
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.680]   And I think he took the thing to 450 million.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.920]   Now, again, I don't remember the exact ratio,
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.480]   but let's say at 450 million,
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.040]   half of the money was going directly to help veterans.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.720]   Well, he just took an efficient organization at 8 million going out
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.320]   to a much less efficient organization,
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.720]   but $225 million was going out in impact.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.800]   And I think he never really got the chance with his team
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.080]   to dial it back down and go back to efficiency at scale,
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.400]   which was going to be possible
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.560]   because so many of those people were monthly givers.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.960]   So there was a high cost to acquire,
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.840]   but then you got a long tail.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.240]   So when you shut off that marketing spend...
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.080]   And by the way, I mean, Disney Plus,
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.200]   they went from zero to 100 million users,
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.080]   I think in the first year,
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.600]   just by spending billions and billions of dollars of marketing.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.800]   We're not seeing that same marketing blitz
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.840]   in year two and year three.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:24.840]   So I'm with you that these are often really wise investments
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.720]   that people need to make.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.880]   But you ask these questions
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   and you start to really understand
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.160]   more about the organization's leadership,
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.520]   more about their history.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.120]   You can make some pretty good decisions
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.320]   with some more information.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.120]   And are any of these sites that provide ratings?
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.320]   I'm sure maybe you don't want to speak ill of them,
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.960]   but how much faith do you put in your own research
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.120]   versus the rating from a charitable rating site?
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.680]   Yeah, well, we've been fortunate.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.040]   I mean, we've had the highest ratings from all the sites.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.240]   I am very cynical about the methodology.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.600]   I mean, it's just a formula.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.400]   You know, it's a 990 is getting put through a variety of metrics.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.320]   And I think that's a whole nother podcast.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.360]   I'm like, man, do I want to even open that?
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   I think they are a good place to start.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.240]   There's certainly a good place to start
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.800]   maybe weeding out some of the egregious actors.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.440]   But it's looking at overhead.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.120]   It's looking at some very simple metrics
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.040]   that is not necessarily an indicator of the impact
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.760]   they are having by moving their mission forward in the world.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.800]   And simply because it can't.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.600]   I mean, there's one and one and a half million charities
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.400]   or something in America.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.200]   So, you know, imagine it's the same thing with the IRS.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.360]   I can imagine assigning 1.4 million.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.760]   You know, let's go do deep dives in all these organizations.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.440]   It's just it's not even feasible.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.320]   So I know a big part of what you guys have done
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.680]   well is around tracking your impact and effectiveness as an organization.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:48.000]   I'm curious if you've ever thought about that perspective on a personal level
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.360]   and how you or anyone listening might be able to apply
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.120]   some of those lessons to track the impact
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.440]   they're having with their own lives or with their own wallets
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.640]   or in their own careers.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.880]   I mean, Chris, I'm probably a bad guy to ask that question to
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.840]   because my KPIs are pretty simple
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.280]   because this is my life's work.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.080]   It's people that have access to clean water
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.480]   because of the organization we're built, because of the movement
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.240]   that we are growing and how effectively we're deploying capital to change lives.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.800]   So we have a pretty simple output.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.920]   I have a personal goal of helping at least 100 million people.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.920]   So that is a benchmark that's out there for me.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.600]   And we help 17 million people.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:40.280]   So if we continue to this path, I would be probably far too old to realize that.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.800]   So some exponential growth is certainly required
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.440]   to achieve that personal goal through work.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.000]   When I think about my family, it's all about character.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.080]   It's all about virtue.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:58.720]   It's instilling compassion, integrity, generosity into the lives of my children.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.840]   Do they tell the truth?
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.680]   Do they admit when they're wrong?
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.040]   It's all kind of soft stuff.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.040]   I can care less if they come and work with me or, you know, go work at a bank.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.000]   It's I'm really interested in the people that they become
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.160]   and the way that they do things, whatever they do.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.960]   You know, are they doing it with the utmost integrity?
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.680]   You know, are they doing it by telling the truth?
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.400]   Are they treating people with kindness and respect?
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.520]   So I think two very different metrics.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.360]   You know, obviously, I'm trying to do the same thing
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.640]   as we build the culture of the organization.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.280]   Are we living up to our values?
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.600]   Are we good all the way to the core?
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.120]   You know, is there anything that is not working that we need to go and fix?
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.920]   Is there anything that's hypocritical?
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.880]   You know, are we saying anything that we actually can't deliver on?
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:49.680]   So we're constantly asking ourselves those questions as a culture as well.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.360]   You mentioned legacy a bit earlier.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.240]   And I know Charity Waters work has had a lasting impact on communities.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.920]   And in a way, that impact is part of your legacy.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.320]   I'd love to explore this concept of leaving a meaningful legacy
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.280]   and making a lasting difference in the world.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.680]   And is that something you think about a lot?
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.440]   It's interesting.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.960]   I probably think about it less for me and more of encouraging
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   other people to think about it.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.440]   But I guess I would think about it as it's really positional
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.000]   or it's an intention of a life.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.680]   I don't think legacy is like, OK, well, I tick these five boxes or,
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.120]   you know, they're going to read at my funeral, A, B, C, D.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.760]   I think of it more as going through life.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.720]   And I said this earlier, but asking the question,
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.480]   how can I take what I have, what I've been blessed with?
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.840]   I mean, everybody listening to this has been blessed, has
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.480]   certainly many things to be grateful for.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:48.480]   And how can I use that in the service of others?
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.640]   I think it's that simple.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.800]   And that is really then a legacy of giving.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.560]   It's a legacy of compassion.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.400]   It's a legacy of generosity that will manifest itself
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:04.080]   in different ways through different seasons of life.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.080]   One of my dreams at some point is to write a million dollar
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.440]   check to a charity.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.360]   I have wanted to pay that forward for 17 years.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.800]   You know, we've been able to turn that million dollar gift into now,
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.760]   you know, well over 800 million dollars raised.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.440]   And I think I was able to give that back to that donor saying,
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.120]   you believed in me.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:27.920]   We've honored this 100% model with absolute integrity now for 17 years.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.720]   And we've kind of turned that one talent into 800 more and growing.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.080]   But I'd like to do it personally, Chris.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.240]   You know, I'm not going to do it through my salary at Charity Water,
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.520]   but I'd love to not just give advice,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.880]   not just fund water projects across 21 countries.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.160]   It'd be fun to write a check and change the game for a small charity
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.520]   the same way somebody changed the game.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.040]   So I don't know if I'll ever get the opportunity to do that.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:58.040]   But I think, you know, if I came into money in some way
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.480]   where I had the ability to do that, I'd be more likely to do that
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.800]   than to try to go blow a million dollars on, I don't know.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.880]   I guess it doesn't buy that much anymore.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.240]   But rather than trying to upgrade myself to business class flights
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:15.640]   for the next five years or something, I'd want that to be useful.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.080]   This has been amazing.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.040]   I appreciate you sharing your story and the story of Charity Water
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.240]   with everyone here.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.720]   We didn't even mention where people can find that video we referenced earlier.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.400]   So maybe let everyone know where we want to send them right now.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.040]   If you'd like to see the video or you're looking for some way
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.200]   to get involved with us, probably the best place to go is The Spring.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.800]   It's TheSpring.com.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.960]   It's where that video lives.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.880]   That's had over 100 million views now across platforms.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.160]   And The Spring is just very simply an online
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.360]   community of people who show up every month.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.240]   It's like Netflix or Spotify.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.440]   You pay them every month, except we will not send you any music for free.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.680]   We will not send you any TV or movies.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.200]   We will take 100% of your money every month
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.640]   and we will turn it into clean water for people in the around the world.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.080]   And I was actually with Daniel Ek in Ethiopia, who founded Spotify
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.280]   and was helping me kind of move
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:15.040]   a lot of our one time giving to subscription.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:19.400]   And that idea and that community has been really transformative.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.880]   We tripled the organization's impact since we started that.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:27.560]   And, you know, the average is it's $40 to give one person clean water.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.760]   So it's probably a lot of people listening, you know, who could donate $40
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.920]   a month and not even really feel that pain.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.520]   But know that every single month, one more person is getting access to clean water.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.040]   If I had one ask of people to consider.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.320]   Yeah, there's people that give $10 a month that are broke college students.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.720]   We have people in their 90s on their pensions who give $10 a month.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:54.720]   And every four months, a person moves from dirty water to clean water,
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.880]   which is a real big impact.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.560]   So check out the video, share it with your friends.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.240]   A lot of the images, Rachel stories in that video.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.080]   You get to see what she looks like and just some really cool stuff
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   and images in there.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.880]   Well, Scott, I appreciate you being here.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:12.320]   I've been a Charity Water supporter throughout the years and will continue to be.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.040]   Thank you for joining me.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.640]   Thanks for having me. Give me the opportunity.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.440]   Thank you, everyone, so much for joining me.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.000]   No matter how many times I hear the Charity Water story,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.120]   I get inspired every single time.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:27.920]   And so this time I'm excited that hopefully we're going to be able to build a well.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.440]   If you want to contribute to the Daffy campaign,
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.840]   you can go to all the hacks dot com slash water.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:36.080]   And like I said earlier, Amy and I are personally going to match
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.040]   the first $5,000 to help get to our $10,000 goal.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.880]   Though, if we get there quickly, I'm going to raise that limit
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.000]   and we'll go for two or more wells.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.480]   We'll go for two or three or however many wells we can build.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.840]   Reminder that you don't need to open up an account at Daffy.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.640]   You can contribute directly at all the hacks dot com slash water.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.440]   Reminder that you don't need to open up a donor advised fund at Daffy
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.240]   to contribute.

[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.440]   But if you do want to set up your donor advised fund at Daffy first,
