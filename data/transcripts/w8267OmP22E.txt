[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   I got a nice little present from Cheap Mind. What if solving one problem could unlock solutions to thousands more?
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.200]   The immortal Ziggswang
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.360]   The strange castle
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.800]   Lisa Dolls move 78 and
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.840]   There we go Alpha goes move 37
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.480]   All moments and games played by AI systems
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.400]   That marked the milestone in the history of artificial intelligence
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.680]   Started with board games went on to protein folding
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   And maybe all solves the rest of this puzzle after all with the same kind of ideas or the same kind of methods
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.120]   Life after all folks is just a game
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.920]   Thank you, Deep Mind. This was a fun visit fun a couple of conversations
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.920]   Thank you for the work you do
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920]   Thank you for the work you do.
