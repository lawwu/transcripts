[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Jamal do you hear that Friberg got busted looking at porn in his computer?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   You know what it was yeah
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:18.600]   I think he was pleasuring himself to that
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.760]   Skin flu
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.900]   You have to go for a quick game of pocket pool. How's your oh my god?
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.120]   It's too exciting you were beating the bishop Allison came in and just like wondering what was going on
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.640]   She grabbed my computer as you looked at it, and it was an essay
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.000]   All right before we get to doge we got a little housekeeping little housey housekeeping, you know
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.520]   We're getting into the holiday spirit here. It's episode 205. We're in year four and we're having a Christmas party
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.500]   It's gonna be great. The all-in holiday
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.440]   Spectacular is happening in San Francisco
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.920]   on Saturday December 7th, I think the VIP sold out there's still some tickets left go to all in comm slash events and
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.320]   If you can't make it to San Francisco, I think you can buy a ticket for $50 on
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.840]   On the zoom. I think we're gonna have it on zoom. Is that right? I might do I have my facts straight there free berg
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   Yeah, there's gonna be a live stream
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.600]   Thanks to zoom for setting this up for us. It's kind of interesting
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.760]   They're doing this thing where you could you kind of you know get access to live events
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.600]   So they're helping us get this set up. You want to watch the stream live on zoom anything's possible
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   It could be spicy
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.000]   Through that. All right
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.600]   Listen best eat you on and bestie Vivek wrote an op-ed a barnburner in the Wall Street
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.760]   Journal about doge the Department of Government efficiency and they laid it out
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.200]   They want to cut overbearing and unnecessary regulation
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   Obviously, they want to cut unnecessary administrative roles save taxpayers money. They want to run it by founders non-politicians
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.640]   helping
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.720]   The Trump transition team find a way to hire quote a lean team of small government Crusaders
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.440]   Teams gonna work closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget. Here's the plan first a game at
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.360]   500 billion in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress then fix the government's procurement process by conducting massive
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   audits during
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.000]   Temporary payment suspensions. This is an interesting playbook that
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720]   Elon has done before so basically
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.440]   Suspend all the payments and hey, let everybody
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.080]   Audit those payments drive change through executive action based on existing
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.840]   Legislation rather than passing new laws and to SCOTUS rulings are gonna play a major role here
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.080]   West Virginia versus EPA
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.160]   That's when SCOTUS rule that federal agencies can't impose regulations dealing with major economic or policy questions unless Congress
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.960]   Authorizes them to do so and looper bright versus Raimondo
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.680]   That's from 2024 and that overturned the Chevron doctrine. We talked about that on a previous episode
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.840]   So according to Doge when combined
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.160]   Quote these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   Congress has granted under the law
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   Doge will use software and legal experts to create a list of regulations that Trump can immediately pause
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   they're gonna make some sort of a leaderboard Elon said and
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.480]   The vague said he would do he suspended his existing podcast
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.640]   I didn't know he had a podcast but he's doing a dogecast a doge podcast and so
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.520]   Freeberg this has been you know a major issue for you. You've been talking about on this podcast that the
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.920]   unsustainable
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.240]   Existential issue for our country is all of the debt we have
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.800]   What are the chances?
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.760]   That this is going to occur because obviously we all know the machine is going to fight
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.280]   to preserve the machine chances that we are sitting here in four years and we've seen meaningful cuts in
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.960]   Spending and a meaningful reduction in size of the government
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.140]   Look, it's doge has probably 18 months to do
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.280]   What they can do before the midterms and there's gonna be an inevitable amount of recoil and backlash that's gonna arise from
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.520]   The actions that they're gonna try and take and President Trump's gonna try and take
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.600]   Under the recommendations provided by doge
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.160]   So they need to move fast and aggressively and that's only gonna cause the recoil to be harder and faster
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.480]   There's gonna be a ton of litigation. Obviously, everything's gonna go to court. It's gonna be
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.960]   Incredibly politicized what is frustrating and challenging to me is that there is nothing that they said that doesn't seem obvious and right
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.800]   I don't know how you can politicize the points that they're making put aside their party put aside who they are
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.560]   Individually put aside how we got here at the end of the day
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.600]   This federal government needs to be run more efficiently more effectively
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.520]   It is unfair and it is a tax on every one of us to have money thrown away
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.440]   To have wasted capital to have bureaucracy that gets in the way of people being able to do their jobs
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.600]   It is a tax on all of us and our kids and our future
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.900]   It needs to be fixed if it doesn't get fixed as I've said countless times before we are in an arithmetic debt death spiral
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.880]   There is no way out of it. So by resolving both the inefficiency
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:50.280]   Reducing the bureaucracy stopping the wasteful spending having accountability in the org in the government. We can actually get the United States another
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.880]   50 years a hundred years, whatever long we want, but we were literally in a death spiral leading up to this moment
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.920]   And I have no idea how we ended up on this timeline
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.840]   I was over the moon and shocked when I read all of the progress over the last couple of weeks and putting this thing together
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.680]   I did not know that this is where we were end up
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   I couldn't be more happy with what I think is gonna happen with doge and its effect on
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.280]   If not actually making the changes shining a light on the issues that need to be addressed and I will say it is unfair
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.720]   To Americans for this to be politicized the Democrats shouldn't make this a Republican issue
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.960]   This is not about Republicans doing damage
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.720]   this is about doing the right thing for the government for the country and the Democrats had an opportunity to own this issue and
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.840]   Instead they've chosen to oppose it which makes no sense
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.800]   It is frustrating and challenging to me as an American to think that this is even a political point
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.080]   This should be a what's right for America point
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.440]   It's almost like we're going to war war with ourselves with our bureaucracy with the morass
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.040]   That's been built up over the last couple of decades and I'm thrilled that this is happening and frankly put the put the people aside
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.440]   Maybe it's the fact that you need people that are as outspoken as challenging as difficult as these two particular individuals
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.480]   They're gonna run this group
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.600]   But that might be what it takes for it to happen in the small 18-month window that they have
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.760]   So that's my rant on it. Yeah great rant and we had a Milton Friedman clip go viral
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   And he spoke exactly about his positions on what he would eliminate
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.320]   Departments like agriculture commerce education. Let's just play that clip. And then there was obviously
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.500]   Malay interview by Lex Friedman earlier this week keep them or abolish them Department of Agriculture
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.480]   abolish gone me Department of Commerce
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.400]   Abolish gone Department of Defense. Keep keep it Department of Education
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   gone energy
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.160]   Abolish health and Human Services. There is room for some public health activities to prevent
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   The contagion will eliminate half of the Department of Health. Okay one half. There we go housing and urban development
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.200]   Done that's gone Department of the Interior. The problem there is
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.240]   You first have to sell off all the land that the government owns, but that's what you should do
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:11.720]   Department of Justice. Oh, yes, keep that keep that one labor. No gone state
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.240]   Keep keep it transportation
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.560]   gone gone
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.040]   the Treasury
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.200]   You have to keep it to collect taxes. All right collect taxes through the Treasury Sachs. You see that clip you see the activity going
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   on with Doge
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:35.440]   Would you think that the machine will allow what Milton Friedman is describing there what Javier Malay is doing in Argentina and what?
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.240]   Elon is proposing with Doge. Do you think the machine is going to allow?
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.600]   You know the wholesale
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.760]   deleting of
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.240]   Department of Agriculture Department of Education at a federal level and move all that stuff to the states
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.040]   What do you think's gonna happen here?
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.920]   And how hard will the machine fight back against this in your mind because hey
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.400]   You might have some Republicans some Democrats. They fought really hard to get jobs to get
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.680]   Subsidies to put in factories, whatever from the federal government. Are they gonna just give that all back?
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.240]   The clip is from 1998 by the way sacks your thoughts
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.720]   Well that Milton Friedman clip as great as it is. I mean it really is outstanding is
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.360]   Setting expectations a little bit too high here
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.480]   I mean, we're not gonna be able to wipe out entire major departments of the government that are cabinet level positions
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.920]   I don't think that's in the cards
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   You know what Milton Friedman's basically describing is a night watchman state and I don't think we're gonna get back to that
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.400]   however, if you look right now at the
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.600]   Opinions on the legacy media MSDN see it and all that kind of stuff
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.360]   They are forecasting that Doge is gonna amount to nothing
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.560]   They're basically saying that the powers that be in Washington are gonna reject it completely
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.560]   There's somehow gonna be a falling out between
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   Elon and DJT. They're just very cynical
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.280]   DJT and then you have people who are not
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.000]   necessarily
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   dismissive in that way in
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:09.500]   The media but just kind of longtime Washington insiders who feel like they've seen it all before nothing ever happens
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.100]   And so they're just very jaded and cynical
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.340]   So I would say that you know again, I wouldn't have the expectations of the Milton Friedman level
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.300]   But I think that the expectations for Doge right now are being set incredibly low
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:27.820]   By the media and by the Washington insiders and I think there are good reasons to believe that the results will surpass
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.380]   those those low expectations
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.140]   number one is you've got Elon Musk running this thing with the vague and
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.440]   Elon understands better than anybody the impact of
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.200]   Deleterious regulations on business so he can really put a microscope on that
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.680]   he's got the largest speech platform in the world with X the largest account on X and he's also built a
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.460]   Get out the vote operation
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:59.060]   That he funded in the last election that he's promised to keep around and potentially expand
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:05.860]   So his influence hopefully is not going anywhere. He's gonna be able to keep using that to help
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.460]   Keep politicians outside. You're right. Yeah
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:16.340]   So that's number one is no one's ever made money betting against Elon Musk and I don't expect that to start right now
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.240]   Number two is you got Vivek who is co-head with?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.100]   Elon of this thing and I think he's a perfect partner for Elon because Vivek first of all
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.060]   He's a brilliant guy with a lot of success in business, but he's also a Harvard trained lawyer
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.880]   He's a brilliant legal mind and I think you could see in that op-ed
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.140]   I suspect the parts that were citing all those from court decisions were his influence and so they figured out a legal
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.340]   Roadmap here. It's not just a matter of kind of
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.440]   Going to Congress and hoping Congress acts. They've got a way here
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.240]   Sequentially to do this through the executive branch through executive orders going through the court system
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.000]   They've kind of got a game plan here. That's not entirely reliant on legislation. So I think the Vicks
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.560]   Influence and and sort of
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.520]   Legal strategic mind is a is a big asset here
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.080]   And then I think the third reason to be optimistic is just the fact that this was printed on
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.680]   The Wall Street Journal op-ed page is suggested in and of itself
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.800]   what this shows is that
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.660]   This Doge effort is I think uniting both the kind of populist reformers and the establishment
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.840]   types within the party if
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.000]   Elon and
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.240]   The vague we're trying to get a mandate for no more forever war. I don't think the Wall Street Journal
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.000]   Yeah, I was doing that right just would not happen
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.780]   So there are reasons to believe that this will not actually divide the party that the party
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.320]   Yeah, could be yeah now look every congressman and every senator is still gonna advocate
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.180]   For their pork barrel project in their district or their state and it's gonna be very hard to push back on that
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.040]   however
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.600]   you could imagine a process like we have with the base closure Commission when
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.100]   the United States needs to close a bunch of military bases and they created a
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:07.600]   Outside Commission to recommend the cuts and everyone kind of shared the pain equally maybe Doge could somehow
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.600]   Play into the horse trade a little bit. Yeah, so I'm not saying it's gonna be perfect, but I do think that if
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   Republicans
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.080]   Share a principle across again both these establishment and the populist side. It would be in
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.520]   reducing unnecessary regulation and the number of
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.440]   Regulators needed the number of government employees needed to enforce all those regulations
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.960]   So I'm hopeful that they'll be able to get something done within the party
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.520]   and since the Republicans have the trifecta if they've got
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:44.000]   Trump's leadership and they've got the leadership of the Senate and House backing it. I think they'll be able to get something done again
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.240]   It's not gonna be it's not gonna be Milton Friedman level, but I'm optimistic. They'll get something good and important done
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:55.780]   I think the easiest thing for them to get done with Doge is the naming the shaming the auditing the
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.200]   Transparency of what we're actually spending because so many of the audits Chamath are just not
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.300]   Completed people don't know what's being spent and if you show Americans a twelve thousand dollar hammer
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:13.860]   Or people with job titles not coming into the office or coming into the office one day a week one day a month
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.340]   That's gonna infuriate taxpayers and I think there's a very easy way to navigate all this
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.260]   You just create the leaderboard and you not only shame people who are wasting our tax dollars
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:31.640]   You celebrate the people who are heroes who start showing frugality and cost-saving and they're gonna do this with the leaderboard of the heroes
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.040]   And the goats this could be the unifying not just the Republican Party as a sax is pointing out Chamath
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   I think this could unify the whole country
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:46.080]   Is there anybody paying taxes that wants to see money wasted that wants to see us pay people high salaries to not come to work?
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.520]   Chamath what's your take on the sequence of events here?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:57.360]   What are easy layups that they could actually get done and then where is the machine gonna fight and try to stop this name? I?
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.880]   think you
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.280]   are highlighting something that they can do right away, which I think is very powerful, which is just using these distribution channels that
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.360]   Elon has now to create a massive layer of
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.160]   Accountability. I do think that sunshine is a really incredible
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.560]   Disinfectant, I think the best way that they could start if possible is to stop paying
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:28.280]   Their vendors until you actually have some amount of accounting to figure out as you said, how many?
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.000]   $600 soap dispensers are actually being bought and sold now
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.200]   That kind of whatever you want to call that corruption or grift
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.680]   It's not going to account for hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.320]   But I do think that it is a very moral and symbolic win
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:52.280]   That says we're going we're going to start to get much more rational and it starts to allow
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:59.280]   the average American to actually feel like they have a little bit of control and they have a more vested interest in
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.600]   How the government spends money, but I want to actually want to take a step back for a second
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.720]   And before I talk about what doge can do
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.600]   I just want to highlight something that's been going on in California because I think it explains a lot in
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.880]   California and I'm just gonna read this that because it's incredible
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.720]   the regulatory burden in
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.240]   California as a state
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.040]   From 1997 to 2015. This is when the data is available that I found has increased by almost 50%
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.080]   as of May of
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.440]   2022
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   There are almost 61
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.760]   thousand
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.880]   individual regulations in the state of California
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.560]   So what does that mean and where does it come from and Nick if you can just put out the tweet it has happened
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.960]   over a period of time in
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.640]   Which the government has been the absolute?
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:59.560]   Singular source of employment in the state and
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:07.240]   we talked about this before where this is also a problem at the federal level when you look at GDP and job growth because it
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.800]   Looks like a lot of these jobs are actually fake
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:17.000]   Manufactured government type jobs. So why is this a problem you've seen in California? The issue that we have is that if you have a
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.160]   Growth in the number of employees in this case in California all the job growth in recent memory
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.240]   Has been state employees. What is the byproduct?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.400]   Regulations go up. What is the byproduct of that?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   There are actually no private sector jobs and more to the point the private sector fleas
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.920]   So now let's bubble that up and look at the federal government Nick if you want to just show that chart that I that I sent
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.680]   you
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.720]   What is incredible J Cal is that the more people are hired by the government?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:54.280]   Lo and behold, what do you see the number of regulations issued by federal agencies has just continued
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.480]   Unabated year-in year-out. You cannot run a country like this
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.880]   So because the
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.960]   Accumulate right Congress is doing less and less of a job actually trying to frame how the country should work
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.680]   That white space is filled in as Freeberg said by these federal agencies it
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.600]   Compounds and accumulates. This is not replacing laws. None of these regulations have expiry dates
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:27.520]   And so as a result, I think what you probably have is an incredible restraint on the u.s
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:33.240]   Economy, I think that the u.s. Economy could be growing at four or five percent
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.120]   But the reason that it doesn't grow at four or five percent is in that one single chart
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.640]   It is impossible to be able to live up to your economic potential when you have this burden on
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:52.680]   Your neck. So I think the real opportunity for Doge is to basically do whatever it needs to do using the law
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.120]   To wipe as many of these regulations off the books. We are better
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:04.200]   Cutting them all to zero and then finding the ones we really need and then repassing those
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:11.600]   Then we are going at this piecemeal and there's some incredible. There's some incredible ideas by the way that this creates
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.240]   Nick, I don't know if you can find this tweet, but Doge asked what people think of the IRS and
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:24.760]   There was an enormous amount of activity that essentially said give us a flat tax and wipe out the tax code
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.080]   The people were very flexible in the amount of tax that they were willing to pay
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.360]   But could you imagine the simplification in the tax code and the implications of that?
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.320]   I was in Singapore by the way ten days ago when I started my trip
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:45.000]   Nick beep out the name of the person I'm about to say, but I had a long meeting with who you know is there and
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.080]   I was asking him the complexity of
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.480]   Dealing with taxes. He's like, what do you mean? We don't we pay a very simple tax system
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.900]   There's no capital gains in Singapore. And so as a result our filing requirements are de minimis the small
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.760]   But as a result people like him meaning great entrepreneurs
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.320]   Can spend all their time thinking about what to build not not a tax optimization
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.760]   Exactly or not or how to account for it. So could you imagine if these guys basically use doge as a mechanism to?
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:22.520]   Shrink the tax code create a flat tax potentially. I know that that has to be passed by Congress. I understand that
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:31.280]   But the idea of just cutting this all the way down and then finding through that process what you actually need
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:38.800]   I think can find America a hundred two hundred basis points of GDP growth. It could be an economic renaissance
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.600]   I mean just to build on that cutting all the regulations to zero you might
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.640]   Have throw out some babies in the bath water. So why not put a clock on them and just say whenever this was enacted
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.560]   Plus five years and then it rolls off or plus two years whatever number of months and then you could have them come off
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.200]   Rolling off every month. I think that's a good idea, but it has no quarterly
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:06.600]   I think that's a good idea. But Jake, I think you first have to cancel all these regulations and then say whatever we need
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.040]   We will reenact
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:15.680]   Your point on a five-year shot clock that then has to be renewed in a new congressional period and I think that that's extremely healthy
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.160]   Well, because you know what people die paradigms shift and then nobody even remembers these regulations
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.600]   You have to do archaeology to figure out who created this
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.480]   What was the intent and you would never do that? You would never live sacks with all of these rules forever
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.020]   It's just one last comment in fairness to these government employees
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:39.640]   The one thing is that it's not their fault right meaning in the sense that they were hired into a regime
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:47.340]   Where the incentive was to regulate so that you had things to oversee and so they did their job
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.520]   In fact, I would say they did their job incredibly well
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.920]   But the point is that now we need to pivot for them to do a totally different job. Well Jamaa
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.600]   I'll hand this over to free free break free break if you
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.080]   Were to get rid of regulations as somebody working in the government you might work your way out of a job
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.920]   so the incentive is completely perverse and
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.920]   Reverse to what we actually need in the country
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.440]   which is less regulation more thoughtful regulation and some process by taking these things on and off the books and
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.880]   Adapting them to reality. Yeah, this is where I think I
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   Think we've talked about this many too many times in the past
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.920]   But like all organizations have a natural tendency to grow they want to grow they're not yes
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.400]   like find me one nonprofit or find me one University or find me one company or
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:39.900]   One government agency that's ever said my job is to shrink myself. It's never happened. So why does that happen?
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.900]   Well, if you look at the like day-to-day
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:48.880]   Operating role of each individual over time like all individuals. They want to do more. They want to have a bigger impact
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   They want to have more scale. They want to have more leverage
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.760]   So there's this natural set of incentives that drives a lot of choices and operating procedures on the ground
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.520]   That create more structure more scale more leverage and drive more hiring
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:08.080]   Everyone wants to become a manager of people they don't want to just be doing the same IC job forever individual contributor job forever
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.360]   So if they want to be a manager, they got to find more stuff to do and then they got to hire people to do
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.380]   That stuff so all of these organizations whether again and we've all been on boards of nonprofits
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.680]   I'm sure and we've all been involved in this sort of thing
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.020]   there's always this like
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:27.320]   Incentive to raise more capital to hire more people to do more stuff that sort of it's really unclear until you really dig into the
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.280]   Psychology of each individual person working there why this is happening
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.520]   I don't think that the federal government is any different each of these people feel they want to be more important
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   They want to have a bigger role. They want to have a bigger impact
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:47.220]   If your job direct directionally is to regulate then what's the scaler on regulation more regulation?
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.020]   So therefore to do more you have to regulate more
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.820]   There's no regulator that says I want to regulate less over time because we've created a system that's one directional
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.700]   So you have to have these resets if you don't have them naturally
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.460]   they're gonna happen unnaturally in the form of social unrest and breakdowns of the economy and
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:11.280]   Collapse of social structures all these other things that happen way way down or as Chamath is pointing out in California in the economic
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.400]   structure of California
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.920]   Which I think is happening on a kind of national scale because of the outsized role the federal government plays
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:24.120]   In our national economy here today. So so you have to have these unnatural forces come in and and do this readjustment from time to time
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.200]   otherwise
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   it's just gonna break on its own and
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:36.040]   Millet in Argentina has basically I don't know a year or an 18 month head start on us and has been doing this
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.560]   He did a great podcast with Lex Friedman
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.280]   They translated it. Actually, they dubbed it which is kind of interesting technology and
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   in
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.440]   This discussion they talked about reducing the ministry's agencies from 20 to 8
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.900]   They fired 50,000 government workers 15% of the total workforce
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.920]   There were three hundred forty one thousand when he started they implemented daily
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.200]   Deregulation process to remove inefficient policies. So they just do that day in and day out
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.340]   They ended discretionary payments to provinces and cities the restored market-driven utility prices. No more subsidies
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.880]   Yada-yada-yada right down the line
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   sacks your thoughts on
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:22.940]   How many months it will take to do this and there's this this discussion and I don't know if that's from inside
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.000]   The Trump administration of hey, we got to get this done in 18 months. We got to get this done in 18 months
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   What can you tell us about the the sense of urgency?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.600]   about getting this done quickly and
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.920]   Why that's occurring
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.160]   well, I think Elon and Vivek have announced that doge will be
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.240]   sunsetting or disbanding at the 250th anniversary of America, which would be
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.840]   July 4th of
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:55.680]   1926 so they've only given themselves about what's at 18 months. Yep, which kind of makes sense, right?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.200]   That's leading into the midterms, right? Right exactly you tend to have the most
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.020]   Momentum coming off an election like this one where you have the trifecta
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.400]   So I think that makes a lot of sense that they're gonna be able to have the greatest impact
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.160]   Let's say in the first year after the new
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.600]   President Congress gets sworn in. How do you get Democrats in on the sacks?
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.560]   How do you push them to join the party to join the movement to be more efficient to be more transparent?
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.400]   Is there a possibility for us to get some?
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.200]   Coordination here with the other side or no
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.400]   Maybe you might be able to get some support of particular Democrats on particular things. I don't want to say that it's not possible
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.800]   Difficult but not not impossible
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.400]   But look, I think what melee has done in Argentina is
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.320]   Remarkable. I mean that was a country. That was a total basket case inflation was out of control
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   It's already because of the cuts he's made
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.440]   they now have a more normal inflation rate and they've gone from basically being
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.560]   Uninvestable to investable as a country now
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:05.180]   The United States is not the basket case that Argentina is but we are on an unsustainable
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:11.360]   Fiscal trajectory doge is also not going to have the power that melee has not gonna have the degrees of freedom to act
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.160]   But we also don't have as big a problem
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.760]   what we need to do is just bend our fiscal curve from being unsustainable to being sustainable and
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.880]   If we can do that, it'll have a huge impact on the economy
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:29.760]   Specifically what we saw in the last election the thing that probably hurt the Democrats the most was inflation
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.340]   Voters clearly do not like inflation. They do not like the diminishment of their purchasing power
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.720]   But how do you stop inflation you have to raise interest rates?
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:45.340]   and that's not good either because that raises the cost of a mortgage that raises the cost of a car payment is bad for
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.920]   Investment right because if interest rates are higher then that means the discount rate on
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.120]   stocks and real estate on every investment class basically is higher and
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.340]   The hurdle rate for investments higher so high interest rates are also bad for the economy
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.360]   So how do you get out of that box where you either have high inflation or high interest rates?
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.960]   The only way is to bend the fiscal curve to that more sustainable path
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.360]   And if you can and if you can do that, the bond markets will actually give you credit for it in advance
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.380]   Because they know that because they know that they're not gonna be flooded
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.100]   With the need to keep funding all of this US government debt
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:29.520]   So we either get to kind of you know startups have this saying about being either default alive or default dead
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.160]   We either get to default sustainable or default unsustainable right now
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.520]   We're unsustainable the bond markets know it inflation remains persistently high around 3%
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.600]   The Fed has not been able to cut interest rates the way that they expected to remember the markets were expecting
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.880]   7 cuts this year. We got basically 3 we got a 50 and a 25
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   So it's just hasn't been the cuts that people were expecting and that's because inflation hasn't come down as much to a thought
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:00.360]   So if doge working with the rest of the government OMB the Treasury
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:07.040]   Congress executive orders can now convince the markets that the US financial picture is more sustainable
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.520]   We'll get credit for that interest rates will come down and that'll lead to a boom in the economy
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.240]   So it's all win-win if they can pull this off
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:23.400]   Pre break any final thoughts here before we move on from doge wishing you on and Vivek as much success as possible
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:29.080]   We've really I mean everybody should be rooting for this. You want to give us your final thoughts? I
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.960]   Feel like America is
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.400]   Neo from the Matrix
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.240]   where there was like a thousand bullets being shot at America and
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.360]   We like literally had to dodge every single one of them in order to get to this this point
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.420]   Mmm, I again I am so shocked and surprised in a positive way
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:55.680]   That we ended up on this particular timeline look everything had to go the way it went for this to have happened
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.040]   Biden decided to run for
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.920]   Re-election Biden stayed in too long. They didn't run a primary. They put Kamala in
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.520]   Ilan all the fences which party won Ilan decided to throw a hundred million bucks at the problem. Ilan bought Twitter
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.640]   China had a real estate bubble
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.720]   I mean you can go down the list of things that had to go right for us to get to this very moment
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:24.520]   Where a small group of people have recognized the fiscal death spiral that the United States
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.880]   federal government has been in and have the authority and
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   The capacity and the skills to be able to go and execute against a solution. I
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.800]   Have no idea how this could have been architected
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.160]   Maybe Saxon you all along and I convinced him two years ago that this was how things had to go and he's been designing it
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.120]   Like maybe you're talking about raid on the end of the Empire for three years
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:53.320]   Maybe we did it free bird. We give you credit when we talk with Dahlia about this. He's like, I've been a handful and
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.240]   also around
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.640]   The the relationship with China, which I think this is all very tightly related
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.920]   We may have dodged a lot of bullets
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.000]   Hmm and if the United States can get its house in order
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.840]   reduce federal spending while increasing
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.160]   economic activity
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.360]   It can be a tremendous unlock for the u.s. And for world peace
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.240]   So because again, I think that conflict arises when we don't have our own fiscal house in order
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:26.160]   And so I feel very positive more more surprised and positive than I was a year ago six months ago
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.320]   It's just amazing. We're on this timeline and I do think the United States as neo dodged a lot of bullets here
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   I told you everything was proceeding as I had foreseen
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.840]   You know what happened to the ten-year and Elon and Vivek wrote that essay
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.960]   I don't actually don't what happened yields contracted by five basis points. You know what the value of that is
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:54.400]   Couple billion 15 billion per year. Yeah. Yeah, so so I think that it was probably a hundred billion dollar essay
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.800]   Just writing it. I think you will find that this doge is quite
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.680]   operational I
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.920]   Mean, I think it's got a chance. I mean
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:14.360]   Right, I want I want all I want all Americans and Democrats to stand up and say this is the right thing for the United
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   States
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.600]   Essay saved us a hundred billion just the essay
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   They're gonna have to be very strategic true about how they detailed what they're doing
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:34.520]   The the doge teams is gonna have to be very strategic to pick things that are consensus building
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:41.640]   That don't make people feel like this is gonna grind the poor more and make the rich richer. That's the expectation
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.160]   That's gonna be the negative framing on this I predict which is just a bunch of rich guys making cuts
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.080]   Talking their books making cuts for things that are their pet projects their investments
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.120]   They have to come out and not make it that they have to make it. Here's inefficiency. Here's inefficiency
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:03.120]   Here's inefficiency and a great way to do that would be to say the efficiency gains and the tax cuts are gonna go to people
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:09.600]   Making let's say under two hundred fifty thousand dollars. These are not these cuts are not being made just to make the rich richer
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.360]   That's gonna be the framing but just my best advice. Don't you think that that's gonna happen? No matter what?
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:21.280]   What which part of it that they're gonna say that no matter what so I actually disagree with the first part of what you said
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.680]   I agree with you that the media the mainstream media will try to characterize this as
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.280]   Hurting the poor I agree and I'm not sure yet. Yeah, whether I start or not
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:36.480]   Yeah, but I think the first part I disagree with is I don't think they should operate towards consensus
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   I think that they should do what's right
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:45.640]   well, you could do what's right and you could start with things that are the most wasteful like if you start cutting kids lunches or
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.360]   Pellgrants
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:54.480]   Or you start cutting people's jobs to in health care education that people perceive are helping people
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.760]   I think you're gonna just feed into this narrative that it's a way to cut taxes on rich people
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.040]   And you know what? You do need to build consensus. How does this thing look as on rich people?
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.840]   If you cut regulations and a bunch of our companies benefit from it just to be self-aware
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:18.760]   the framing is already that this is an effort for companies that we invest in to
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.560]   Have less regulation to make the equity holders in those companies more rich
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:28.440]   I just have to make sure that the hold on it for all you have to make sure the savings is for all
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.240]   Americans and that all Americans benefit from it and the way they benefit it the best framing they could do is
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:39.640]   Your taxes are gonna be lower because you're not wasting your tax dollars if they can keep to that not hey
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.120]   We're moving regulation so that our company needs to be honest with her
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.320]   Yeah, being a hairdresser requires more regulation than being any one of most of my companies
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.840]   So I actually think it better percent
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.800]   I think it benefits other people way way more than it benefits me and you have to use it as my point show it
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.840]   That's the point is you have to show people that you're doing this for everybody
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.240]   Not just for the people on this podcast and our friends that's gonna be the key what sum up just said is so important
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.120]   There's a great interview
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:13.320]   I've mentioned this in the past between Tim Ferriss and Charles Koch from a couple years ago where he brings up this exact example
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.920]   Yes about how regulatory burdens make it difficult for women to become hairdressers
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   It's like $7,000 so they don't have the capital to do that because of the regulatory
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.160]   Yeah burden to get there think about building building your home or you know
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.320]   Like let's say you want to change put a shower in your bathroom change the shower in your bathroom
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:36.840]   You don't want to spend $15,000 on all the permitting regulatory stuff to make that happen. It's gonna unlock value for everyone
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.280]   That's a small example of kind of a regulatory problem
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.560]   But this benefits everyone and the cost of my point is you have to communicate that you have to be able to communicate that and
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.440]   That's where using the launch platform
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.200]   Perfect job of communicating this to people and that's the playbook Freeberg. That's my point
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:01.800]   People are gonna fight this you have to convince them. You have to show them that this is helping everybody
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.000]   Can we just agree that they're okay, but that's different than how you started you said only work on consensus projects
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I don't know. I didn't say that. I think you have that
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.480]   Them first I said do those first make sure that people understand. This is to save them money
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.320]   I'm not saying that you don't change regulations for
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.840]   Spaceships and self-driving cars as well
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.400]   but you have to make sure you show people that this can benefit them or else they're gonna just fight it and
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.440]   That and that's gonna be the whole all this effort will be for not
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.280]   if you if you get a bunch of Republicans sacks who start fighting this and you have a splintering in your party because
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.840]   They feel like this isn't helping their local constituents. This whole thing could be for not
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:46.640]   That's my story that you told is gonna be told by the legacy media and all the haters and the enemies
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Regardless of what?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.400]   I don't think so. I think
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:56.600]   You show people on haters
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:02.960]   I'm talking about the public election now is the time to implement when you show people
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.640]   $22,000, you know hammers and wasted money. You will get a hundred percent of Americans
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.600]   Backing this now 60 minutes been doing that for 30 years. Nothing's happened. We got to just act now
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.460]   Yeah act and bring people on with communications. I mean if you got if you're
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.940]   Poorly great not for it. Yeah, I'm not saying that communication isn't part of the job
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.600]   In fact this whole conversation started by us talking about an op-ed
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:34.360]   Yes, Vivek wrote correct and we're doing a podcast right in which they're laying out their objectives and they're doing podcasts
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.200]   And yeah, Elon has the biggest following in the world and biggest following
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.760]   so I just don't think communications can be the problem, but you're also not gonna be able to convince everyone and
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.280]   You know, we've already won the election and now's the time to figure out very strategically how to implement as much as possible
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.680]   Be humble by two million votes. Keep it in mind. You have to bring everybody along. Okay, you know what?
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:01.520]   It was fair. It would been 20 million votes for Trump. I have one under these circumstances and he won the trifecta
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.360]   It's impressive
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.400]   Nobody's saying it's not it. I'm not minimizing it. I'm just saying be aware
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:15.760]   There's 74 million people who are rooting against Trump and I think getting some know them. I'm not true. That's not true
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.040]   I think there's a decent number of people who are probably very upset that you know
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.800]   Trump won just like last time they were upset that Biden won
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:29.240]   Including all Americans in this is the most virtuous thing you can do. I think everybody should get on board
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.640]   I think it I think it's deranged the idea that 74 million people are actually rooting against him
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.560]   I don't think that that's true. I don't there's a feel good that they lost people don't feel good about losing
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:45.320]   Bringing those people on board is virtuous dude. There's already been a huge five shifts in the country. Have you seen the Trump dance?
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.360]   I mean, there's been such a vibe shit. Let's see it. Let's see it
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.300]   I'm not gonna do it right now, but there's been such a huge vibe shift
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:39:02.680]   The energy right now is incredible and I think people are feeling much more optimistic
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:08.040]   can you imagine what a downer would it be if like we were expecting President Kamala Harris to take the oath of
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   It would be a downer to me if there was still pushing a seven point two trillion dollar federal budget next year
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:21.560]   That would be a downer. And by the way, I think that there's a deeply linked relationship between social issues
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.640]   economic issues political policies and
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:31.040]   foreign conflict they all seem like they're four different things, but they're so tightly interwound and
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.360]   It's interesting how everything kind of moves together with this shift in who ended up wanting winning this election cycle
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:44.420]   And I think it really speaks to the relationship between the four. Well, by the way, there's a great meme
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.200]   that was floating around where it showed a photo of
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:56.000]   Trump Elon Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard and it said that all for the fuel used to be Democrats. Yep. Yep
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Rogan in it. I tweeted that
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:07.720]   It used to be that that Democrats were progressive progressive means progress looking forward and the last decade the last couple years in particular
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.440]   I think a lot of people that I know that are former Democrats and Chamath you can speak for yourself
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.460]   feel like the Democrats stopped looking forward and it was all about trying to like
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.600]   pessimistic and
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.880]   Grievance and vengeful and all of a sudden you've got guys like Elon
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:29.680]   Promoting themselves as Republicans highlighting that it's all this is the party that looks forward. This is the party that drives progress
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   It's an amazing shift. I
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.120]   Don't know if there's been anything like it that's happened this quickly
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.960]   And I voted more to make America great again than I did vote for being a Republican
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.360]   I think that the Republican Party right totally
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.840]   Is is less important than it's ever been and I think MAGA is more important than it's ever been
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.800]   I agree, and I'd say the biggest risk to the whole agenda. It probably is not the Democrats
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.720]   it's actually some of these old bulls in Congress who are
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:05.540]   Anti MAGA for some reason Trump is the one who just won the trifecta. He does won this big election
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.620]   If you stick with the old Republican message, you're just a surefire loser
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:16.920]   So give Trump his due as the leader of the party realizes now a MAGA party and let's get some things done
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:23.120]   If the reform agenda fails to be frank, it probably is not gonna be the Democrats
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.560]   It's probably going to be these holdouts and the Republican Party. Yeah
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.360]   Yeah, yeah, that was my question earlier. I think I asked it twice. I didn't get anybody to engage in it
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.800]   How do you convince them? How are they being brought on board to this if they have all this pork barrel spending?
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.880]   Is there a strategy there? Would you have a strategy?
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.720]   I think sacks laid it out, which is that if you use the combination of the carrot and the stick I think the carrot is
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:52.200]   Creating transparency and I think the other part of the carrot is
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:59.760]   You'll have now an extremely well-funded pack that can support people who are on board with this agenda
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:05.240]   But the stick is if you don't I think that if Elon makes us a really concerted
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:10.640]   Long-term part of his strategy then I think you should run candidates who actually are aligned with the agenda
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.880]   That the make America great again movement wants
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:20.740]   so I think that's the carrot and stick Jason, which is like some of these old Republicans will have to decide do I
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.200]   basically help invest in a renewal of the American spirit or do I keep pushing back because I like the way it was and
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.960]   I want to go to war and I want to cozy up to these lobbyists. I think those folks are gonna have a very
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.140]   tough
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:39.440]   Four and eight years because I think you'll see a bunch of MAGA candidates rising up to run against them
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.160]   Everywhere in the United States as you can see my young apprentice your friends have failed
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:51.240]   Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station, man
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.280]   I said be humble like three times. None of it's sinking in
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:01.320]   No, I just explained I explained the rest. I've been very clear. You're not gonna get Milton Friedman
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.360]   Okay, you're not gonna get Javier. Malay. Well, we can hopefully get as a bending of the curve towards sustainable
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   I mean my expectations to be realistic. Okay, I mean breaking even would be great if we do just weren't adding to the debt
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   That would be amazing
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.360]   Look if the federal budget gets to three trillion
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.520]   And
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   regulation gets cut if you get
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.440]   50% of
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:31.600]   The regulations in federal agencies cut I think you unleash an economic sonic boom
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.640]   I'm all in and I think I think it's the greatest thing that could ever happen. My gosh
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   Could you imagine America clocking in?
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:45.760]   Regulatory, I mean how much you guys start with your own knees zero. I'm dealing not a real regulatory
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:51.880]   The regulatory stuff is brutal man. I mean like what it's legit brain like melting
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.640]   Tell me your number one regulatory
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.760]   Frustration we can go around the horn. This is a great topic. Actually, I don't have any I think I'm very blessed to work in an industry
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.600]   That's very light with regulation
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:08.800]   I think it affects many many other industries that if they were unleashed could contribute to American real estate
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.280]   construction
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:18.200]   Regulations are very regressive because they touch poor and middle-income people way more than it touch folks like me
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.040]   Rip these regulations out
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:28.240]   To regulations that do affect you crypto regulation and capital formation. Both of those things are
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.760]   They haven't heard this is my project, but they definitely are
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.400]   Economy, right? I can snap a finger and raise a couple billion dollars
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.920]   That is not it's so I'm in a unique position and I and I recognize that what is much harder
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   is if you're trying to be an
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.440]   Electrician if you're trying to be a hairdresser if you're trying to be a massage therapist when you have to spend
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.280]   15 20 30 percent of your salary on licensure. Why?
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:57.320]   Why do we need the rules totally if you're a person that's trying to like construct a home
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.600]   Why does it take six and eight weeks to get permits approved? Why?
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:06.520]   And there are no good answers for these things. So forget about me like it doesn't matter about me
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:13.440]   But the mainline part of the United States economy as I said before is a coiled spring if you get rid of those regulations
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.560]   It disproportionately impacts middle income and lower middle income jobs
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   This is why if you if you see if you see GDP if America clocks in GDP at four to four and a half percent
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.520]   Watch out folks
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.060]   Sonic boom watch out. I'll give you two really simple ones allowing
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:39.020]   Everybody in the United States to participate in company formation would change everything
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:46.120]   95% of the company cannot participate in investing in startups or any, you know, new
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:53.680]   I think it would be a massive freedom to operate just freedom to do stuff. You know, that's what it is
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.640]   I mean, you're free to go to Vegas and gamble you're free to you know, play, you know
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.920]   I think the next order you're not free to buy Bitcoin. You're not free to buy you are free to buy Bitcoin
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.480]   You can buy what you can yeah, but you're not free to create a token, right?
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.920]   Of regulation, I think there's many more traditional
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.280]   Forms of economic growth that we can have before we need to make ICOs
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.940]   Legal and easier. I want to say something. I think that the person that runs for governor in, California
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:29.600]   Should commit to cutting those 65,000 regulations down to 10,000 as needed
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.200]   to replacing the DMV with a digital app and
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.900]   To cut taxes to near zero and to create school choice
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:43.280]   Whoever does that will create a renaissance in California
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.800]   It's the fifth largest economy in the world folks, and it can be a bellwether for the rest of the world
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:55.440]   well, you know there there's a lot of scuttlebutt online that Nicole Shanahan is gonna run for governor of California and
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:59.200]   I'd be all in favor of that. I would say that of all the
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:06.400]   Political personalities involved in the election over the past year. She gets my most improved award
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.160]   I remember when like Bobby named her to his ticket
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.160]   I was a little bit skeptical of that choice
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.840]   Because of some of the causes that she had identified with or donated to in the past
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:21.040]   But she I think has ended up being a star. She's pretty based. She's a yeah, totally
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.200]   I mean, she's she's red-pilled and ended up supporting
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.280]   my hat and Maga and
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:32.360]   I don't think we're gonna get anyone better in, California. So she's wanted to do it and take it on. That'd be awesome
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:36.180]   Sacks, what about you? You don't want you don't want that that mansion
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.920]   It'd be a significant downgrade for me. That's about to say
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.200]   Easy what yeah, you could live in the governor's mansion also known as smaller than your guest house
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   That'll be your backup man cave. Well, actually that's happened people have in New York
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.080]   I remember one of the governors was like, yeah, you know, I'm good. I don't need to live in the mansion
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.260]   Where do you want to go next boys? We have other things on the docket
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:08.520]   Would you like to go to our war correspondent? Would you like to go home Google breakup? Would you like to go Nvidia?
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:13.480]   Where would you like to go World War three? I think is important sacks. You put World War three on the docket
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   Would you like to teed up for us? Yeah
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:20.320]   Sure. Well, there's a several events that have happened in reasonably close succession
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:27.280]   The first thing to understand is what's happening on the ground in Ukraine. The Ukrainians been losing territory and accelerating pace
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:33.320]   There's an excellent graphic in the New York Times that I'll put on the screen that shows this it's not a stalemate
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   Remember I said on this podcast
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.800]   Six months or a year ago that it was no longer a stalemate
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.840]   it was a war of attrition in which the Ukrainians were now losing and
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.540]   Every single month now the Russians are taking more and more territory again. The curve is accelerating
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:51.920]   We'd all invest in a business who had a growth curve that looked like this. So not good news for the Ukrainians in
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:57.080]   Response to that. I think that's funnily the condition on the ground that's created the next set of actions
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:02.720]   Which is the Biden administration finally approved the use of long-range missiles attack
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.700]   Um's missile storm shadows to hit territory deep inside of Russia the Russians
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.480]   Believe and I don't know whether this is true or not
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.000]   but what they say is that those weapons cannot be operated without
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.120]   Americans or British
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.840]   Operators being there to you know, they're too complicated for the Ukrainians just to use on their own
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:30.040]   so they the Russians view this as not just a direct attack on their homeland on their motherland, but also a
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.400]   direct involvement by
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.160]   the NATO allies United States and
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.960]   Britain in the war and that is a big escalation
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   You know a lot of people say that
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.600]   The Russians have all these red lines we keep crossing and they don't do anything
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.160]   That's not true
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.120]   If you actually listen to what the Russians have said there's only been two red lines
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:55.040]   the first red line was they said they would not accept NATO expanding to Ukraine and
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.400]   They proved their
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:05.000]   Seriousness on that issue by invading Ukraine in February of 2022. The second red line is they said that they would not accept
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.240]   American long-range missiles being used to target inside of Russia and that line has now been crossed
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.740]   So this leads us to the next set of events, which is
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:23.120]   Russia just used what may be some people are saying it's an ICBM, but it probably is more likely to be
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.240]   Not an intercontinental but an intermediate range
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.840]   ballistic missile that hit a
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.560]   Ukrainian city and it's obviously it didn't carry a nuclear payload, but it's the type of
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.940]   ballistic missile that is used to carry
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:44.520]   Nuclear weapons. There are a couple of features of this that I think are really important number one
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.080]   It's a hypersonic missile it hit the target at something like Mach 10
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.720]   What that means is that it just can't be intercepted is too fast
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:56.280]   the the West and the United States in particular does not as far as we know have a
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.040]   Technology to intercept a hypersonic missile like that. The second is that it had what's called a Merv?
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.480]   Warhead or payload Merv is multiple
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   independently targeted
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.400]   Reentry vehicles basically what it means is the warhead splits up, right when it gets close to the ground
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.240]   It splits into six separate warheads. And the reason for this as I understand it is diabolical again
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.840]   It's just if you're launching nuclear weapon
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:29.320]   It just makes it that much harder to now intercept it because now you've got six warheads hitting you instead of just one
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.600]   so I mean
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.520]   as I understand a missile like this has never been used before and what the Russians are doing obviously is
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:43.440]   Sending us a signal and what that message is is that they're saying we have the means to hit any
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.640]   European city or any European asset
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:53.880]   With a hypersonic missile that you can't stop that may or may not have a nuclear warhead
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.040]   attached to it and
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:03.760]   It's just a way of them expressing their seriousness and displeasure and and and reacting to an escalating in response to the fact
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   That we are now allowing
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:11.360]   Western missiles to be hitting targets deep inside of Russia. So the bottom line is this war is escalating
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.600]   It's escalating to we're good and at some point soon
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.280]   Yeah, it's really we're gonna have to get off of this escalatory
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.200]   totally or we're gonna end up in a really disastrous place and just the last final point is
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:32.360]   It's absolutely remarkable that Biden decided to take us to this place with what just six weeks left in his term
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:40.280]   Completely as a lame-duck president. What is his mandate for doing that for taking this extraordinary risk on behalf of the country?
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   The voters just voted for Trump who made it really clear
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.320]   He wanted to end the war and Biden and his team have unilaterally now escalated this war
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.720]   They did it without consulting with Trump's team
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.080]   At least that's what was publicly reported is there was no briefing set up for Trump's transition team
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:01.960]   So you have here Biden his team taking a unilateral action to expand and escalate this war
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.520]   Even when he's a lame-duck president and the question you have to ask is why what is the point of this?
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:15.000]   Well, I think it's just completely deranged because it's not just that forget Biden and Trump for a second if you take a step back
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.880]   What was voted in?
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.440]   Was to end this war and for the United States to get our hands out of it
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   So you couldn't have a clearer message to the sitting president in the White House, which is this is not what?
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.640]   Americans want and
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   So to basically ignore the will of the voters and to essentially go and push another country into the brink
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.200]   I think is so incredibly responsible and you know other times we've said in the past
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.920]   Take Donald Trump
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.120]   Seriously, but not literally
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   Russia you should take seriously and
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.560]   literally
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.080]   Because they actually write it down for you and tell you and so when they said
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.000]   Every act of aggression from now on is going to be
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.600]   Viewed by us on a look-through basis to the actual country that is enabling this to happen
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:11.280]   You couldn't be more clear, but Americans couldn't have been more clear, which is we don't want this war anymore
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.520]   And I just think it's really deranged what the Biden White House is doing. It's incredibly dangerous
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.920]   By the way, not to mention. It's incredibly costly as well
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:25.360]   I mean, we've had like some last-minute efforts to sort of tamp down on these last-minute budget approvals and whatnot
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:30.320]   but we're talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars that we're giving on top of the risk of of
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:36.800]   Nuclear escalation. I just think it's absolutely crazy. It's absolutely crazy. Putin is not a dummy
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.440]   He has heard and seen
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.120]   Trump's campaign rhetoric and
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:52.480]   Sacks, I don't know if this is this has been publicly reported that he had a call with with Trump after the the election victory
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.840]   Does Putin not see that in a couple of weeks a couple of months?
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:02.040]   There will be new leadership in the White House and there's gonna be a path to a resolution here
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:09.180]   Like does that not give us all a little bit of reprieve that this is not going to escalate because everyone's waiting for January 20th
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.080]   Oh, I mean for sure. I mean, thank goodness
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.800]   I would say that we have a new president coming in who does not own this war
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:21.440]   I mean the problem with Biden is that he completely owns this war and he does not want to admit defeat
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:27.960]   And so what you've seen is that over the last couple of years every weapon system that Biden said he wouldn't give
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.680]   To Ukraine because it could literally cause World War three. These are Biden's words
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.320]   He said it could be Armageddon if we gave Ukraine f-16s
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.720]   It could be Armageddon if we gave them Abrams tanks
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.640]   it would be Armageddon if we gave them high Mars and attack 'em's and
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:46.320]   Could lead to World War three if we let them hit targets inside of Russia. These are Biden's words and
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:52.760]   He has basically given it on every single one of those points because he's so committed to this policy, right?
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.480]   He's he's in the quagmire. He can only double down. He doesn't know how to extricate himself and
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.500]   Now we don't know exactly what Kamala Harris would have done
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.920]   But I think probably she would have inherited Joe Biden's policy and likely
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:09.840]   Continued it and I think we have a wonderful opportunity here with Trump taking office. He doesn't own this policy
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.840]   he can look at it with fresh eyes and
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:18.400]   Most importantly he campaigned on ending the war so he has the mandate of the American people to stop it
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.440]   All I can say is thank goodness and we just need to get through the next two months
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.840]   We just need to get to January 20th without there being some new
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.600]   horrible escalation in this war
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:38.680]   He's by Joe Biden is martin galing that's his strategy for the Ukraine-Russia war just keep doubling down and doubling down
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.760]   Oh, yeah, do you wanna explain what that is? Oh, yeah. Sorry
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.560]   Martin galing is a strategy in gambling where let's just say, you know
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.400]   You start betting $1 and you lose
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:52.760]   your next bet is $2 if you lose your next bet is $4 if you lose your next bet is $8 and
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.600]   Eventually you'll win once is the theory
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.320]   But there's many times where Martin galing does not work, but you only win $1
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.360]   So you could be betting, you know
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.200]   80, you know 40 bucks 80 bucks $160
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.280]   $320 and then you finally win and you win $1 right or or you go broke
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.880]   That's a great analogy because you can also go broke, right?
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.160]   Caps at the roulette table
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.680]   One time I would do this. That's why all casinos have a max
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.640]   Yeah, so I would do this as a joke with my wife or when I was at the World Service of poker
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.840]   I'd be like I'm gonna pay for dinner or lunch or whatever and I put a hundred dollars on black lose
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.920]   put 200 on black win go pay for lunch and I did it one time at the
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.880]   WSOP and I went 100 200 400 800
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.880]   1600 I ran out of cash. I got 3200 from my friend. I put it down the floor man came over and said
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.640]   That's your last bet. Oh
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   No, my buddy and I
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:55.320]   If you do this, yeah in our college years early 20s, we would go to drink for free at the casino
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.320]   You just sit at the blackjack table and just yeah
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:05.240]   I mean if you bet a dollar and then you bet two bucks
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.080]   You can just keep drinking for free for like two or three hours and then go out and enjoy your night
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.760]   You've made 15 bucks and call it enough. Did I tell you about the losing a million dollars playing roulette? No
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.560]   me
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.600]   Nick you got to beep out the names me. It was me
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.680]   And tell me this you did tell me this yeah, this is so good says guys have developed a system it's full
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:35.560]   That's always what happens before you lose a million and he says that it's like we need to risk a million
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.040]   We can win like two or three
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:42.120]   And it's like ninety nine point nine nine six percent
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.800]   So so I say to him. So are you really telling me that we just have to fade?
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:54.960]   Point zero zero four percent chance of like total loss. Mm-hmm, and he says yep. Well, guess what hit the point?
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.880]   percent shot
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:04.880]   Me slowly and and it was devastating. I just kept looking at this thing. Like what just happened. He's like, oh we lost
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.280]   Yeah, and I was like there it is folks. I never again. I've never gonna play roulette again
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.400]   I think the gambling analogies are the right analogies cuz I look I'm not saying World War three is gonna happen
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.960]   I've never said World War three is gonna happen
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.400]   I'm saying that there's a risk of World War three and I don't need the risk to be very high to be very worried about
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.560]   It because it would be such a disaster often, right?
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:30.740]   Exactly. So I want to minimize risk of ruin. I want to exactly I want there to be hopefully a zero risk of that
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.800]   But you know, what's interesting is remember just like a week or two ago
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:41.640]   President Trump made that trip to DC and he met with Biden in the Oval Office and Biden had this he was like all smiles
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:47.000]   and I'm everyone's like wondering why is he so happy and the speculation was
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.440]   That he somehow wanted a common to lose or something
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:55.640]   But now you think back on this he must have known he was about to authorize this decision
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.300]   So what he's doing here, he's grin
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:04.280]   He's grin Trump. He knows he's about to give Trump this horrible hand, right?
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.840]   He's about to make this situation in Ukraine so much worse
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.660]   So that Trump will have to inherit this mess. That is like the definition of grin
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:19.560]   Yeah, he definitely knew more than that picture let on because a lot of the interpretation of that picture was
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:25.880]   They are getting along. He's being super gracious. What an incredible gesture. It just looked like very
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:33.040]   He promised a smooth transition of power and then we find out that he didn't confer with his successor about
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.560]   this extraordinarily
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:43.080]   Meaningful decision to escalate the escalation. Yeah, it's like that's just crazy. It's crazy
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.000]   You guys want to do science corner? I got one for you. Yeah
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.200]   All right, your super fans are desperate for a science corner. Give him one free board. Give him something
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.440]   All right, I will give you guys something here. Here's a depressing
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.680]   Paper that was published in the journal nature just this week
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.480]   research team out of Switzerland
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.260]   going over to the Swiss where they are conducting extraordinary research in
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.400]   the
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.120]   Epigenetics of fat cells in so we're gonna fat shame me on the science corner. Go ahead. Great
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.760]   No, we're actually gonna understand perhaps why it is difficult for people that have been overweight
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:29.880]   Yes to keep the weight off. I did this and I think it's fascinating. Yeah, explain it. It is it is really incredible
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.480]   So remember we've talked about this many times in the past
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.920]   but every cell has your whole all your DNA all your genes and
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:42.800]   Certain genes are turned on or off in different cells and those genes being on or off
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.960]   Differentiates those cells and causes them to act differently
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.840]   That's the difference between an eye cell and a skin cell and a heart cell is they have different genes that are upregulated downregulated
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.920]   turned on and turned off and
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.340]   Even when you have different kinds of cells you have certain genes that are overexpressed or underexpressed or overregulated or upregulated or downregulated
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:06.860]   So that means that those genes are turning pumping out certain proteins that do certain things in that particular cell
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:12.860]   So what these folks did is they wanted to understand what is the epigenome meaning?
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.540]   What are the genes that are turned on or off or upregulated and downregulated in?
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.820]   fat tissue and fat cells and
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.860]   Does the epigenome change
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:29.980]   When an individual loses weight, so once they're obese and
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:37.280]   They lose weight to the fat cells actually change their epigenome or date. Do they have an epigenetic memory?
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.820]   Meaning that those cells even though the person has lost weight those cells
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:46.220]   Still continue to act as if that person were obese. So I'll tell you in humans
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:53.940]   They basically took five individuals that were obese and lost more than 25% BMI and they looked at the epigenome
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:58.860]   They looked at the markers of what genes are upregulated and downregulated before and after they lost the weight
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:05.620]   After they lost the weight there were a set of markers that were still upregulated that are associated with poor
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:11.980]   Metabolism and increased fibrosis and increased cellular death. So these are inflammatory genes
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.980]   These are genes that are associated with the cells being inefficient that utilizing glucose to create energy
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:21.860]   And so these cells continue to act like slow dying cells
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:28.100]   even after the person lost weight and they did the same thing in mice and they found similar results that they
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.340]   Caused these mice to gain weight
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:36.580]   Looked at the epigenome of the fat cells and then looked at the epigenome after they lost the weight and again the mouse
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:44.060]   Epigenome continued to act as if the mouse was obese. And what this means is that the metabolism remained reduced
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.300]   Fibrosis remained elevated and likelihood of cell death remained elevated
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.900]   so now they applied glucose in a petri dish to those cells and they saw that the
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:04:00.460]   Glucose had a harder time being fully being appropriately utilized from a healthy fat cell that hadn't been obese
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:05.860]   So it actually permanently alters and creates an epigenetic memory in the fat cells
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:08.940]   After obesity and this could explain
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:13.540]   Pretty significantly why when people that have been obese lose the weight
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.760]   they are more likely to gain the weight back and have a
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:24.460]   Weight off you're referring to yes, and that makes total sense because anybody who's added weight chamath if that you add but
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:29.340]   You know, you eat one extra Oreo a week. That's 3,500 calories
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.900]   You do that over 20 years all of a sudden you wake up one day you're 20 30 pounds overweight
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.900]   like I was three or four years ago and this is why I think
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:41.980]   Ozempic and we go V and on journal and all these things are so great because it does seem like it breaks you through that. No
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:48.440]   Well the problem what we do see in all those results that when you go off of the glp1 agonist grugs
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.100]   You gain the weight back very quickly. This is some amount of weight. Yeah
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:59.180]   It's a pretty significant bounce-back effect. So and and this is pretty well documented and
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.540]   So I think that it speaks to the why now the it also introduces an opportunity
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:09.180]   hmm, there are molecules that can turn certain genes on or off can now be identified and
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:14.660]   Utilized to change that epigenetic memory. So now there's that switch in addition
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:22.540]   Yeah, exactly. This could arise from things like increased exercise. It turns out that when you do significant amounts of cardiovascular exercise
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:29.740]   there are certain genes that are expressed that trigger other genes to switch on or off and so we can start to identify those particular
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.460]   molecules and
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.540]   produce either supplements or
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:43.140]   Additional drugs or combo therapies that can both knock the weight off and keep it off by changing the epigenetic memory in those cells
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:46.300]   Wow, and so it introduces a whole new class of opportunity
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:52.140]   For folks to explore how do we help folks that are obese lose the weight and then flip the switch that they can keep the
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:59.100]   Weight off. I've been doing rocking. This is like the old man activity that Peter Attia and these guys are all you put weights on
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:04.100]   And you like go walking where if I started with a 10-pound weight vest now, I'm at 35 pounds
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.580]   I do a mile and a half hike every day with 35 pounds on man. I fall asleep
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.340]   immediately and the amount of
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.860]   Intensity that puts on your body you do it right before you go to bed
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:21.260]   No, no, I do it anytime during the day, but I'm just saying it's it's I'm focused on four things right now with my health diet
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.980]   sleep
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.220]   Exercise meditation and I try to do all four each day
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:33.300]   But the rocking specifically in this zone two stuff is what they say 40 50 year old should focus on so that's what I'm focused on
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:38.580]   But that rocking man, does it make your whole body strong? I highly recommend it. It's really transformative
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:43.060]   My meditation is reading those essays for Chamath Palihapitiya
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.740]   German dictator
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:50.660]   80/90 he's running a software company services company great. Look at you in the driver's seat
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:58.100]   David Friedberg your Sultan of science working on a hollow and the architect the rain man
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:02.020]   yeah, definitely David sack from craft ventures and
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:07.060]   Maybe it's gonna be involved in doge. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a sacks doge
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:11.060]   Hook up in the future. I don't know. I'm taking a guess here. I am
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.580]   Your host here Jason Calacanis
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:20.940]   See you all on December 7th live or in person by the way, did you guys see this spectacular?
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   Did you see this tweet from Brian Johnson?
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.340]   He tweeted out all of his blood levels. This is
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.340]   Incredible. I love this guy. Look at these results
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:36.300]   They're incredible if he can break this down into like a turnkey thing that mmm normal folks like us can
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.500]   follow
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.140]   for people who don't know
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:47.500]   What this kid's doing is he is spending like three million dollars a year or something to that effect on his own personal health
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.860]   Documenting it sharing it everything from sleep
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:56.620]   To his bone density. Everything is an open book and he's made some products out of it as well
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:01.660]   So you can you can eat his pudding - if you're interested in it, but I don't think it's as good as how do you follow?
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.540]   His regimen, you know what? I mean? Like it just seems too hard. You can't have a job
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.900]   I mean he's doing it's like he's got two jobs right now doing all this stuff. His biomarkers are showing
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.180]   He's ten years younger than his actual biological age
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:20.020]   Dude, look at some of these results his his speed of aging. He says his birthday now happens every 19 months
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:22.740]   What the?
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.220]   Freeberg I

[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:37.460]   Well, I think his nighttime erection rate is pretty impressive. Not three hours and eight minutes for a nighttime erection
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:41.420]   How does he is he reading? Is he reading Ilana Vivek's?
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.100]   He's reading it very slowly
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:52.460]   Wow, he's got a 240 pound bench press and an 800 pound leg press
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.380]   Jesus he looks like he's dead though. That's the only problem
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:02.620]   So pal sax has got to go DJT online - we'll see you all next time

[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:30.100]   Besties are
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:44.080]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just like this like sexual tension
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080]   But they just need to release
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.180]   What
