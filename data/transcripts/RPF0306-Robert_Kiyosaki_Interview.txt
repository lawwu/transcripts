[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.240]   [Spanish]
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.740]   [Birds chirping]
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.840]   [Spanish]
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.160]   [Spanish]
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.200]   I enjoy reading books and I find them to be, frankly, one of my better investments.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.880]   I don't know how you get more bang for the buck than to plunk down 10 or 15 or 20 bucks for a good finance book
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.920]   that gives you potentially hundreds of dollars or thousands or even millions of dollars worth of ideas.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.560]   And I do this thing where I like to ask people about what their favorite finance books are.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.000]   And you do this long enough and you start to get a sense of the ones that really matter.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.400]   I can list 10 off the top of my head.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.520]   But there's one book that seems to come up more than ever, more than all the rest.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.560]   Seems to have sparked more people's financial journey than anything else.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.120]   That book is a book 20 years old called "Rich Dad, Poor Dad."
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.880]   And today we've got the author of "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," as well as all the dozens of follow-on books,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.000]   Mr. Robert Kiyosaki here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:38.240]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.800]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280]   Man, I'm excited about today's interview.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.040]   I think you're going to really enjoy it.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.680]   It's interesting to talk to a man who has shaped the personal finance industry
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.480]   and since this is the show where we work hard to figure out how to live a rich life now
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.720]   and how to build a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.800]   why not learn those things from the guy who shaped the industry?
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.480]   [MUSIC]
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.360]   I really do mean it.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.640]   If you start to profile people and ask them what book started you off,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.760]   I don't know how he did it.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.520]   But "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" was probably one of the most motivational books that I've ever heard of.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.840]   In the personal finance industry, it seems like its effects can be felt everywhere.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.960]   And so many people say, "Man, I read 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' and it changed everything."
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.720]   And Robert Kiyosaki, he's been just pumping out best-selling books since then and building
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.880]   a massive empire of a business.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.480]   He's also not a stranger to controversy because what's interesting is "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" is
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.720]   one of the more controversial books on personal finance.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   Now, in today's show, I think you're going to enjoy it because we're just going to talk with
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.240]   Robert as a man, as an author, as a man, and get his insights on personal finance, the industry,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.280]   and on what and how his advice has changed over the years and what's currently true and what's
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.840]   not been true.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.440]   I think you're really going to enjoy this.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.120]   It was a pleasure to sit down with him virtually over Skype.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.560]   It was a pleasure to talk to him and to hear what he's been able to accomplish.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.920]   And in line with the value of the show, living rich today and building a plan for financial
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.000]   freedom in 10 years or less, it's hard to get better than Robert Kiyosaki.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.400]   Before I play the interview for you, two sponsors for today's show.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160]   Number one is Paladin Registry.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.440]   Paladin Registry was my response to coming up with an answer for a question that many of you
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.640]   have asked me, which is, "Joshua, how do I find a great financial advisor?"
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.760]   And I said, "Well, I'm not sure.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.360]   It's a tough question to answer."
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.360]   And so I connected with Paladin Registry and Jack Wehmeyer, the founder.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.560]   Basically, Jack's-- here's the deal.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.440]   He's a former financial advisor, and he got sick and tired of not having a good answer
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.640]   to that question himself.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   So he created a careful vetting process to sort through the good financial advisors and
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   try to weed them out from the bad ones.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.000]   So if you are looking for a financial advisor-- and personally, I believe that we all need
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.160]   a good financial advisor-- I would recommend starting your search with Paladin Registry.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.000]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N, or just click the banner on
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.720]   the website.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.960]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.840]   Put in your information.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.440]   They'll connect you with a couple of advisors.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.880]   It's up to you to take it from there.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.920]   But at least start with having advisors whose credentials have been checked, whose disciplinary
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.040]   record has been checked.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.680]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Sponsor number two today is Trade King.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.800]   Trade King is the official brokerage company of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.840]   Trade King, I reached out to them, and I asked them if they wanted to sponsor the show because
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.840]   after meeting their CEO at FinCon 2015, I had a feeling that something was different,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.000]   that he was actually working hard to build a culture and a company that actually would
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.720]   do a good job.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.040]   I drove down to Fort Lauderdale, met him, met the executive team, met many of the employees
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.480]   and customer service reps, and I felt very, very good about bringing them on the show.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.120]   So here's the deal.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.600]   $4.95 stock trades, also great customer service.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.760]   In addition to that, they have a really great low-cost robo-advisor platform as well, which
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   you can check out.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.120]   Check out all those things at TradeKing.com/Radical.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.360]   TradeKing.com/Radical.

[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.640]   you fund it.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.400]   I think you've got to fund it with $1,000.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.560]   So you fund your account with $1,000, and you get $100 bonus to your account.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   So hey, if all your stock trades don't work out, at least you get an extra $100.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   Robert Kiyosaki, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.560]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.280]   Thank you.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.800]   Been looking forward to talking to you.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.160]   It's hard for me to think of anybody who has had more of an impact on the personal
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   finance industry than you and your Rich Dad Empire.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.520]   To the best of my knowledge, is Rich Dad Poor Dad still the best-selling personal
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.560]   finance book of all time?
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.600]   That was from Publishers Weekly.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.680]   But it was just recently.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.000]   Publishers Weekly had it up there again.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.640]   That's awesome.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.840]   Well, congratulations on that.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.120]   20 years.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.000]   Do you know that?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.720]   20 years.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.320]   I'm probably, in some ways, almost the perfect consumer of your content because 20
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.360]   years ago, that's when I was just starting to pay attention to personal finance.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.680]   When I was a young teenager, I'd spend my time hanging out in the bookstore reading
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.360]   personal finance books, and there were always a number of purple book covers quite
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.480]   prominently displayed.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.200]   That's how I was working on books.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.280]   I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.320]   I like the title of your show, "Radical Personal Finance," because that's kind of
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.920]   my category, is I'm radical.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.280]   I really don't like what most financial planners tell people.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.920]   Well, this ought to be a fun interview.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.320]   As a former professional financial planner, I've seen both sides of the industry.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.880]   I was widely schooled in the personal finance side and also then moved over to the
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.520]   professional side.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.360]   So I've seen both sides and live to tell about it.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.400]   So I'd like to begin with a question primarily about your message.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.600]   You're most well-known for "Rich Dad, Poor Dad."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.120]   And as you mentioned, we're talking 20 years of publishing history.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.920]   If you were to distill the essence of your message, the lessons that you want to teach
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.640]   to your listeners, your readers, your audience, what would you say is the distillation of
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.200]   your primary message as it relates to personal finance?
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.360]   That's a great question.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.360]   It goes to chapter one, lesson one, and most people miss it.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.320]   You know, they say, "Read 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad,'" but they don't know what lesson one,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   chapter one is.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.720]   And lesson one, chapter one is, "The rich don't work for money."
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.760]   And that goes right over their head because from birth, you know, we're programmed to
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.560]   work for that paycheck and to save money and to invest money.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.960]   And that one statement, "The rich don't work for money," is not between their left
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.000]   ear and their right ear.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.440]   So it doesn't comprehend.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.240]   I may as well speak in Japanese or Swahili, you know what I mean?
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.680]   They don't understand what I'm talking about.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.640]   And because they don't understand that statement, "The rich don't work for money," most
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.320]   people then become enslaved to money, working for money, saving money, and investing their
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.120]   money.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.680]   It's that one statement, "The rich don't work for money," is a radical statement.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.360]   Do you think of that as a place to start, as a cause?
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   Meaning that if you start with that statement, "Okay, the rich don't work for money," and
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.240]   if obviously I have a goal of being rich, most people who are studying personal finance
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.120]   share that goal, is that a good place to start as a financial plan or is that the outcome
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.560]   that you're ultimately working toward?
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.600]   Well, Joshua, I mean, that's why I'm laughing at your radical personal finance because
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.960]   we're in the same category.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.400]   In other words, there's, you know, lesson number one, really, for all of us is choose
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.760]   your teachers wisely.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.200]   So a rich dad, poor dad is about two different teachers.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   My poor dad, who was the head of education for Hawaii, PhD, you know, and then my rich
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.360]   dad, who was an entrepreneur, and they both say different things.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.080]   Now, in our world of personal finance today, the leaders are, of course, Suze Orman.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.200]   You know, she's number one.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.240]   And then that's, then next is Dave Ramsey, and then there's you and I on the outside.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   But we're radical.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.160]   And the reason Suze Orman is number one is she talks to poor people.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.920]   And I'm not saying they're poor because they don't earn money.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.880]   I'm saying they're poor because they have poor spending habits.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.760]   As a financial planner, you'll see that most people make money, they just mismanage
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.400]   their money.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.680]   That's why they're poor.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.480]   So that's why she'll say, you know, I want you puppy, I want you boat.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.280]   She goes, denied.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.120]   You know, and we all need a Suze Orman in our lives to say denied.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.880]   And Dave Ramsey, his byline is live debt free.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.440]   Now, that's a great idea if you're middle class, but you're going to get crushed that
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:09:59.680]   way.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.120]   And then there's guys like me who are basically saying I use debt and I don't pay
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.600]   taxes.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.520]   And they go nuts.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.880]   You go, what are you talking about?
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.920]   Because like I said, it doesn't fit between their left ear and their right ear, but it
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.560]   all goes back to lesson one, the rich don't work for money.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.920]   And the reason the rich don't work for money is after 1971, when Nixon took us off
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.960]   the gold standard, the US dollar became a currency.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.080]   It's no longer money.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.800]   And they can print as much as they like.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.240]   And as you know, today, the whole world is printing money.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.000]   So why would you work for it?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.200]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.280]   So that's why it is radical.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.720]   The Suze Orman for the poor, Dave Ramsey for the middle class and me for the rich.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.440]   That's the difference.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.280]   That's why the rich teach our kids about money.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.560]   The poor and middle class do not.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.240]   I don't work for money.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.440]   I acquire assets.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.400]   I build assets.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.840]   I have businesses.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.640]   I have real estate.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.440]   I have oil wealth.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.200]   But I don't want a job.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:03.280]   When you're beginning, if you were given, and I agree with you about the segmentation
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.320]   of financial advice.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.040]   Yeah, it's a broad category.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:14.320]   And as a professional financial advisor, that's one of the things that I would argue most
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.120]   strongly for is that good financial advice is always specific.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:24.320]   We who are, you and I in a media space, we always face the difficulty of giving generalized
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.080]   advice and then trying to teach someone that you've got to figure out how to apply this
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.600]   within the context of your own specific situation.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.880]   And that's where--
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.740]   Amen.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.960]   That really is amen right there.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.600]   You can't do what we do if you need Suze Orman.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.080]   If you can't control your spending habits, let's say you make $100,000 a year, but you're
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.600]   spending $200,000 a year.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.480]   You need Suze Orman.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.120]   You don't need us.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.040]   Right, right, exactly.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.520]   And so we've got to find the person whose advice is suitable to us at a point in time.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:09.600]   I'm going to use myself as a case study and just ask you to lay out what today in 2016
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.160]   is going to look like.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   If I, as a young man, just for your knowledge, I've got a young family.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.120]   I'm in an excellent financial position.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.320]   I live a rich life.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.840]   I'm not yet a millionaire.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.720]   But I've got cash.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.760]   I've got capital.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.640]   I have assets.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.800]   I've built a number of assets that are working well in my life.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.040]   If I were looking at the investment opportunity landscape and also just considering the marketplace
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.240]   here in 2016, what are the types of opportunities that you would counsel someone like me to
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.640]   look for to build wealth?
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.600]   Well, let's say it's spring Q1 of 2016.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.800]   To me, the best opportunity is in gold and silver.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:59.280]   And that's going to pass too, because if gold is under $1,500 an ounce, it's a good time.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:06.800]   It passes $1,500, or let's say silver passes $20, it's no longer a good investment.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   So as long as gold is under $15 and silver is under, let's say, $20, it's probably the
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.120]   safest thing, better than the stock market today, which is on a downward trend.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.600]   And the governments are going broke.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.080]   So they're probably going to print.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:33.680]   And the only two political guys actually speaking about it are Donald Trump and who's the African
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.040]   American neurosurgeon?
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.600]   Ben Carson.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.720]   Ben Carson.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.160]   They're the only guys talking about it.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.440]   And I think it goes over most people's heads.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.320]   Like, Ben Carson says, "Hey, look, our national debt's not $20 trillion.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.760]   It's $250 trillion."
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.000]   And Trump says the same thing.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.920]   But the average American doesn't even know what that means, because it doesn't fit between
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.200]   their left ear and their right ear.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   So I didn't--
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.680]   And they don't know what's going to come down the road.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.160]   You can't keep running out that much debt.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.300]   Right.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.960]   I didn't expect that as an answer.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.240]   I had intended to ask you about some of your perspectives on central banking a little bit
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.480]   later.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.440]   But let's jump to it now.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:20.880]   Why would you feel so confident in saying that gold and silver are an opportunity?
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.960]   What's the research or what's the thought process behind that recommendation?
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.680]   Well, it goes back to everybody-- in an election, everybody's talking about Reagan.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   But Reagan had two criminals inside of his operation.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.920]   You know, one was this guy, Caspar Weinberger, who was Secretary of Defense.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.520]   Another one was Alan Greenspan, you know, the Fed chairman.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.840]   And those guys-- I mean, those guys ripped us off.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.320]   They ripped us off big time.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:58.000]   And then we have these incompetent guys like Bernanke and now Janet Yellen, who are economists.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   They're academics.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.560]   And most academics are like poor debt.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.160]   And they're risk-averse.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.360]   They're not very-- they're very smart in one area, but they're not smart in all areas.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.320]   So what Janet Yellen-- I mean, she doesn't-- she has not a clue how the central bank called
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.480]   the US Fed rips us off or the ECB, the European Central Bank, or the Bank of Japan, or the Bank
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.040]   of China.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.680]   And the reason we have this huge gap between the rich and everybody else is because we
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.960]   have a currency crisis.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.560]   We don't have a stock market crisis or a real estate crisis.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.160]   We have a currency crisis.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.480]   And as long as you can print money-- that's why Ben Carson, $250 trillion, is kind of
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.520]   my number also.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.480]   It's called the unaccounted financial-- it's called-- my brain's not--
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.160]   Unfunded liabilities.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.440]   Unfunded liabilities.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.880]   We're broke.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.640]   And the question is, how are we going to handle our brokenness?
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.520]   Are we going to print money, or are we going to cut it off?
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.480]   I think we're going to print.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.720]   So that's why I bet on gold.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.840]   And I could be wrong, but I'd rather have gold right now than dollars or yen or pesos.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.200]   Today.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.680]   Today.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.240]   Right, right, right.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.080]   Tomorrow, if gold's at $2,000, I'm not buying anymore.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.580]   Right.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:20.960]   But if that were the case, wouldn't you rather have a productive asset as compared to a non-productive
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.200]   asset?
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.120]   Or at least-- let's talk about my situation.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   So you're in a very different financial situation.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.080]   You've made your fortune.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.720]   Or at least you've made plenty of fortune.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.800]   And so now you've got to think intensely about protecting that, which is a different scenario.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.280]   You're at a different phase of life.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:44.240]   For somebody like me, wouldn't you think that gold or silver are generally less productive
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.120]   than some of the other business pursuits that I could participate in?
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.600]   They're definitely less productive.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.440]   But right now, I'm waiting for the crash.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.160]   I wrote a book.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.240]   It came out-- it started in 1996, and it came out in 2002.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.520]   It said the biggest financial crash in history was coming in 2016.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.800]   So looking at the long view, I think we're going to collapse in 2016 or 2017.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:14.320]   And when that happens, you want to have gold or cash, because people will be in a short
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.800]   squeeze.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.640]   And a short squeeze is when somebody has to sell anything that's somewhat liquid, like
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.040]   their Mercedes or their house or whatever.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.400]   They don't have to start getting out.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.920]   And so I'm waiting for the crash.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.880]   We're at an all-time high in the stock market.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.760]   Are you kidding me?
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.120]   Why would you buy anything?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.080]   So when that baby comes down, that's when you get rich.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.400]   You get more rich when things crash.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.320]   And that's what most people don't realize, is when afterwards crashes, the better time
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.280]   to start businesses and acquire and do those things.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.320]   I'm waiting for the crash.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.640]   That's why I'm kind of biding my time.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.200]   How would you define the word "crash"?
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.160]   Well, the same thing that happened in 2007.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:06.480]   You know, if you go to my website, richdad.com, you have pull-up pictures, I mean, video of
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.920]   me with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, and I'm calling the crash of Lehman Brothers an old thing.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.320]   And I'm so far ahead of my time.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.600]   So 2016, the same thing is going to happen.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.040]   There's all the lakes going to come out.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.000]   But this time, it's not going to be just a U.S. crash.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.920]   It's going to be global, because China is in serious, serious trouble.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:34.320]   So that's why you're going to see a crash of epic proportions in 2016 to 2017, outside
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.040]   2018.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.600]   And that's when you'll get rich.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.040]   So in some ways, in many ways, I agree with you.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.120]   I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the word "crash."
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.840]   It goes a little-- it's a little more sensational than I'm--
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.720]   It's called "collapse."
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.920]   It's called "collapse."
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.720]   That doesn't help.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.480]   I'm uncomfortable with the word "crash" and the word "collapse."
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:58.960]   But I've also said many times on the show, my best guess is severe recession or depression.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.400]   No, no, no.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.880]   Collapse.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.080]   OK.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.280]   We'll agree to disagree.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.400]   Let me tell you why.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:04.900]   Go ahead.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.200]   If it scares the hell out of you, you may prepare for it.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.000]   If you sugarcoat it, like what's called political correctness, you might say, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.160]   yeah.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.960]   It won't be a problem."
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.760]   But by scaring the you-know-what out of yourself, you may start taking action.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.680]   And that's why I use severe words.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.600]   I use severe language.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.040]   Because hopefully, most people will be like deer in the headlights.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.920]   They won't do anything.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.560]   And other people like you will say, "Well, maybe he's right and he will do something."
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.520]   But if you sugarcoat it a little bit, mild recession and all this stuff, it may as well
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.400]   be Janet Yellen.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.360]   But here's my rebuttal to that.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.720]   If you are too strong with your language and you are—and I understand, you wrote a book.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.000]   You wrote the book Prophecy.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I read it, I think, a couple years or so after it came out.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.040]   And so, I don't necessarily expect you to agree with me.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.640]   But here is my counterpoint.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.360]   If you're too strong with your language, what happens is people have a tendency to grab
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.640]   onto the emotion of what you're saying rather than the more careful, logical perspective.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:13.520]   And my fear is that in the same way that those who are concerned about something like Y2K,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.000]   and they ran out in a frenzy and they said, "We've got to stock up because Y2K happens."
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.920]   And they buy a pallet of freeze-dried food and a generator.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.960]   And then on January 2nd, they say, "Well, that was a waste."
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.800]   And then they get rid of all the food in the generator.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:34.880]   I think a more realistic approach is to say, "Be prepared for disruptions in society."
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.680]   And Y2K is one possible scenario, so be ready, but don't go crazy about it.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.760]   And so, in the same way I would apply it to finance, I would say, "Be prepared for
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.200]   significant recessions, be prepared for stock market crashes, be prepared for long-term
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.280]   depressions, but don't bet the farm on it and make sure that you're prepared to take
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.840]   advantage of the business opportunities that come out of it."
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:02.640]   That way, if you and I are wrong about our timing or wrong about the Fed so far has certainly
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.480]   seemed to be able to fulfill their mission, and who knows, will they continue to be able
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.440]   to or not?
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:09.920]   I don't know.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:16.080]   But that way, at least you leave people thinking and more prepared for the normal fluctuations
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.240]   with severe occurrences in between.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.800]   What say you?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:24.080]   That sounds politically correct to me, but I think you're both bunch of...
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.480]   Look, all I'm saying is this, and as a financial planner, you know 90% of the people are not
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.360]   prepared.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:29.760]   Agreed.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.880]   Okay, so they're already either complacent or they're terrified.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.960]   I talk to my family all the time.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   They think I have my head up my butt, you know, because they have jobs.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.480]   And you tell me people are losing their jobs today?
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.640]   You know, the big thing of the presidential debate was that Carrier just wiped out 2100
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.720]   jobs in Indiana or something, and people are crying, gnashing their teeth.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.520]   What do you want to say to them?
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.640]   You know, I mean, if I'm telling you a crash is coming, it's coming.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.200]   I promise you that, because in 2007, I made so much money.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.280]   I borrowed $500 million in 2009.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.520]   Half a billion dollars.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.560]   That's how you get rich.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.800]   I was ready for it.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.880]   What'd you do with the money?
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.800]   I bought real estate.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.240]   You know, at 3%...
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.680]   I was floating at 5.5% interest.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.600]   They did reduce it down to less than 3%.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.880]   You know how much money I made on all that debt?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.360]   I made...
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.800]   They're giving money away.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   So when all those real estate prices crashed, because they were at all-time highs, I went
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.640]   in and bought all the real estate I could buy.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.560]   How on earth do you buy $500 million of real estate?
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.280]   That's what I do.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.480]   Well, what I mean, though, is the scale.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.520]   I mean, it's one thing to go out and find a couple of single-family homes, but when
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.000]   you get into, I mean, those numbers, I mean, that's thousands of properties.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.520]   Were you deploying it in large commercial property or individual transactions?
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.080]   10,000.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.840]   10,000 apartment houses.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.340]   Okay.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.640]   We operated at a mini rate.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:15.280]   Our thing is just, look, Rich Dad Poor Dad, I started when I was 9 or 10 years old.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.000]   You know, I bought my first property when I was 20-something.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.280]   And what increases is your knowledge and experience as you go along.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.360]   So I didn't start off with 10,000.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.560]   I started with one.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.820]   Excuse me.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:35.920]   And my knowledge increases, and I make my mistakes, and I screw up, and I correct.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:41.680]   And then one day I had 100, and then the next time it was at 1,000.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.160]   And then from 1,000 to 1,500 didn't take so long.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.920]   And then when I knew the market was crashing, that's when we moved in, right after the crash.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.480]   So you should read my book.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.000]   It's called Second Chance.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.840]   You know, it just came out a year ago.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.320]   And in there you'll see the charts and graphs.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.840]   I just read the charts and graphs.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.600]   It's clear as day when the markets are going to crash.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.560]   I have in Second Chance a chart of the Dow for 120 years.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.720]   You will see that we've had three major crashes since 2000.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.560]   We've had two real estate-- no, two stock market crashes.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.160]   And we've had one real estate crash in the first from 2000 to 2010.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.880]   And I call 2016.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.400]   There's going to be a currency collapse.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.480]   That's a very severe word.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.960]   Now, if it doesn't happen, fine.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.480]   I'm still going to do the same thing.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.640]   I'm still going to use debt to buy real estate.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.440]   Nothing changes.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.240]   You know, I mean, I just-- I'm aware of the ups and downs of markets.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.760]   And that's what Second Chance-- you just get the book, read it.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.200]   I use debt.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.240]   I don't save money.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.200]   I don't have stocks.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.360]   And I don't pay tax.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.600]   That's my personal finance, legally.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.960]   So I'm not saying you should do it.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.680]   I'm just telling you.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.160]   That's why I like the title, Radical Personal Finance.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.520]   It's precisely radical.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.680]   - Trust me, if you listen to the show, we--
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.640]   it's funny, some of the audience is longtime listeners.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.040]   They're chuckling at you saying that I'm politically correct.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.640]   I consider this politically incorrect financial talk.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.040]   - No, no.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.000]   - You're polite.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.680]   But I was a Marine in Vietnam.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.760]   The time to be polite, time not to be polite.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:32.560]   You know, if I really suspect that we're going to collapse, I'd better say it.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.880]   And that's why I love Trump, you know, because he just-- he called-- he said,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.840]   George Bush, you know, he was the skipper of the Titanic for 9/11.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.520]   For the economic collapse and for the invasion of Iraq.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.040]   He said, the guy is incompetent.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.880]   And all the Republicans say, how can you say that?
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.760]   How can you say that?
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.880]   Well, that's what happened.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.720]   That's what happened.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.680]   And no, no, no, that didn't happen.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.480]   That didn't happen.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.160]   George didn't do that, you know.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.960]   Give me a break.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.720]   - Over the years, you mentioned Donald Trump.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.640]   He is probably the premier figurehead currently of controversy
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.800]   and turning controversy to his advantage.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.920]   And over the years, you've certainly been embroiled in various controversies.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.400]   How have you learned to deal with-- personally,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.200]   with deal with the emotion and the business impact of controversy?
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.360]   - Oh, I mean, when people call your names and all that stuff?
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.680]   - I just-- it goes more than that.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   But I mean, you-- first of all, I mean, your-- all of your writing was built upon
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   a controversial title, your initial book about-- "Don't Go to School."
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.720]   I forget the exact title.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.120]   Forgive me.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.760]   So that's obviously a controversial perspective.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.880]   But then over the years, your books have been incredibly successful.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.160]   And that's brought a lot of public scrutiny.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.400]   And there's even a Slate article this week challenging a lawsuit that you're engaged in.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.960]   And I don't care about the particulars of that.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.840]   That's a-- you know, people-- that's a place for another format.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.960]   I'm interested in the personal experience of that,
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   of how have you learned personally to deal with that and maintain,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.880]   I guess, a sense of happiness while going through controversial situations?
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.960]   - That's a great-- that's a very good question.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.040]   I do a lot of meditation.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:25.680]   And I also-- you know, if I am, let's say, wrong, I admit it.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.440]   And I just pay the dues.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:35.040]   But other than that, if I'm worried about what pencil heads think of me,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.720]   then I'm a pencil head, too, you know?
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.960]   I-- look, I just-- you can ask my accountant.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.680]   I have the money.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.720]   I have all that stuff.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.320]   Most lawsuits are frivolous, you know?
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.040]   I just got charged, again, some of this is a sexual harassment.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.320]   I said, "You gotta be kidding me."
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.480]   People are so f'ed up today.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.280]   It's incredible.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.920]   But if I run my life upon that, being afraid of pencil heads,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.640]   not worth living, you know what I mean?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:11.280]   - Over the course of 20 years as a teacher and author and lecturer and guru,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.480]   and I mean that in a complimentary sense, not a derogatory sense,
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.520]   what would be some of the biggest mistakes,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.400]   or what advice have you given over the years that you've come to regret?
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.080]   - I haven't.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.120]   I've told people, "Your house is not an asset.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.320]   Savers are losers, and I don't invest in the stock market."
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.880]   And I use debt, and I don't pay taxes.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.240]   I mean, I don't just give advice, I live my advice.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.840]   And the thing that's happened, that's why "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" came out in April of 1997,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   so it's 19 years, 20 years next year,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.800]   is almost everything I've said has come true.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.960]   I've said, "Savers will be losers."
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   And now we have quantitative easing.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.360]   You don't have ZURP, you know, ZURP is zero-interest rate policy.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.320]   You now have NERP, negative-interest rate policy.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.200]   It means you have to pay to save money.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.400]   So savers are the biggest losers, and people are still saving money.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.720]   And I said, "The biggest stock market crash is coming in 2016."
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.520]   And on schedule, we've already lost one-third of the wealth of this country.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.040]   And those guys with 401(k)s just got wiped out in 2016.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   So, I mean, I just call it as I see it.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.080]   If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.800]   But so far, I'm fairly accurate.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.720]   I also called 2007.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.400]   So all I'm just saying is we're going to collapse in 2016 or 2017
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:41.600]   simply because we're going to go the same way Japan did and Greece does
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.920]   and Puerto Rico and Brazil.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.840]   We can't keep printing money.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.480]   So that's why lesson one, chapter one is the rich don't work for money.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.440]   And that's why I said right now, I think gold looks pretty good
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.080]   because if money comes down in value of the dollar,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.280]   then gold should go past $2,000.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.760]   I wouldn't buy past $2,000.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.360]   But I'd rather have gold than the dollar right now.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.600]   50 years from now, gold will still be around.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.480]   The dollar won't be.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.080]   That's what's happening.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.360]   And so if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.800]   But so far, I'm right.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:23.040]   A consistent theme of your message is to acquire and invest in financial education.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.600]   So I assume you put your money where your mouth is
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.840]   and that you have developed mentors and advisors,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.920]   obviously, beyond the rich dad figure that you talk about.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:39.440]   Who do you look for financial advice, economic advice?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.200]   Who are your current mentors, advisors, and sources of financial education?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.280]   Well, one is Donald Trump.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.560]   You know, we wrote two books together.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.800]   And we're both real estate guys.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.840]   Also, there's a guy named Bert Dillman,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.440]   "The Grace of Wellington" report.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.800]   Everybody should subscribe to that.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.280]   And a couple other guys.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   One, the big one that really understands it is a guy named Richard Duncan.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.800]   He wrote "The Dollar Crisis."
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.600]   He's hard to read.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.480]   That's the only problem.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.200]   But when he wrote "The Dollar Crisis,"
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.840]   it was easier than to predict the downfall of China.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.080]   And so what I'm saying to people right now, and Kyle Bass just said it,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.440]   this is the Chinese banking crisis will be bigger than the U.S. banking crisis.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.920]   So you can sit there and hope and pray and buy your mutual funds
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:34.320]   and hope that guys like Kyle Bass, myself, and Duncan and Dillman are wrong.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.120]   Or you can take evasive action right now and do something while gold is under
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.080]   about $1,200 an ounce or silver is at $1,500 an ounce.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.760]   Because the problem is not stock markets or real estate.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.640]   It's currency.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.200]   That's why the rich don't work for money.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.080]   In 1971, Nixon took us off the gold standard.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.680]   And today it's called quantitative easing.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.600]   We have printed more money than any time in the history of the world.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.760]   And when we have $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities, the odds are
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.800]   they're going to print some more to cover it.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.880]   Now, if they don't cover it, we collapse anyway.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.240]   You grew up in Hawaii.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:23.680]   And as I understand it, Hawaii would lean towards more of a liberal political philosophy.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.340]   What did you say?
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.520]   Very common.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:36.160]   If they believe the government should solve our problems, I don't like the government.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.080]   Understood.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   Hawaii is one of three states I haven't yet been to.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.600]   So I was being careful with my description.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.160]   I'm trying to.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   It's just that I don't keep my money there.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.880]   And no one would keep my money in California or New York.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.380]   Right.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.920]   I'm not that stupid.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.960]   I didn't do well in school, but I don't keep my money in Hawaii, California, or New York.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.840]   Texas is better.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.720]   Florida is better.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.240]   Nevada is good.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:07.200]   So you grew up in a liberal environment, and your biological father was in the government
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.160]   school system.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:15.920]   But today, you seem to have moved in a very libertarian political direction and a very
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.120]   free market Austrian economics position.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   How did you come to that change of thinking?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.000]   Well, that's the story of Rich Dad Poor Dad.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.360]   My rich dad was theoretically an uneducated man, but he was very smart financially.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.920]   And he really thought that he's kind of like Trump.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.520]   He didn't really not like government.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.800]   He says you got to have them.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.560]   But he said he just don't want to think like him.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.440]   You know, and so my poor dad always believed the government should take care of people.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.400]   So my poor dad was more like Bernie Sanders and Hillary.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.960]   And my rich dad was more like Trump.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.800]   That's the difference.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.280]   And we all have those choices.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.520]   So I don't I don't I don't trust my government at all.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.960]   I mean, I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.840]   I went there twice.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.520]   And we're lied to the same thing we're being lied to in the Middle East right now.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:17.920]   You know, those ISIS is made up of a lot of Saddam Hussein's ex fighters.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.800]   We finance our enemies.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.760]   So I don't really want to participate.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:32.720]   You've for about 20 years, you've skirted the issue of talking about the identity of
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.960]   the rich dad figure.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.320]   Do you ever intend to disclose a name or put that controversy to rest?
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.880]   I think it was already disclosed.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.760]   I did a radio show with his son.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.840]   It's called Rich Dad Radio.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.880]   You can go to his archive.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.120]   And we talked about what he taught us.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.480]   Who was the who was the rich dad?
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.120]   What was his name?
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.800]   I don't I don't give that.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   See, there you go.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.000]   You're going right around.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.200]   What was the name of the son?
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.160]   What difference would it make?
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.960]   If you just go to Rich Dad Radio, you want to listen to the program, go listen to the program.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.000]   All right.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.720]   So it's I will.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.480]   It won't make you any richer, I promise.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.680]   I'll let you go on that one.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.200]   How we doing on time?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.880]   I got a couple of questions more.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.640]   Do you have a few more minutes or do we need to cut it off here?
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.240]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.080]   Okay, because I know we only we're only booked for 30 minutes.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.240]   I want to be respectful of your time.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.840]   Personally, in your teachings, you talk about escaping the rat race.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:39.280]   And I'm interested to know at what point in time, historically, in your life, did you first
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.440]   come to the realization that you had actually escaped the rat race?
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.640]   What was the what was the how did you know that you were out of the rat race at that point?
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.560]   That's two good questions.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.360]   I would say about 1994.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.800]   So my wife and I met in 84 and we were free by 94.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.520]   We weren't rich.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.880]   We're making about $150,000 a year without working because we had real estate.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.160]   And we weren't paying taxes on $150,000.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.200]   So that was our goal.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.960]   But you're not rich at $150,000.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.760]   And then I would say last year, I went past what I need.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.040]   You know, I have too much money now.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.600]   So it was kind of a it was kind of a tragic year because I was going, no, my game is finished
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.360]   because I have I have more than enough money.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.560]   So then that's wealthy, as rich as wealthier than what's next.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.160]   So that's kind of my evolution.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.720]   But why did you know?
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.400]   And the reason I let me give you more backstory and more context for the question.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   In the personal finance industry, we gurus talk a lot about escaping the rat race and
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.360]   having enough money to be rich or to be financially free, financially independent, etc.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.440]   But the thing I've noticed is and this was one of the conclusions I came to as a financial
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.840]   advisor was that nobody retires.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:08.800]   And the reason nobody retires is that those who are rich and wealthy don't want to retire.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.440]   And those who are desperate to retire because they don't want they don't want to do what
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.760]   they're doing anymore for work, never actually build the money to retire.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.520]   And so on its face, almost nobody retires.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.680]   Obviously, I used to work with retired clients.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.160]   That's a it's a it's a provocative statement.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.200]   But when you look at it, Conrad, Donald Trump is not retired.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.320]   You're not retired.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.680]   Dave Ramsey is not retired.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.840]   Insert whoever, whatever popular rich figure that you want to talk about.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.800]   Nobody retires.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.080]   And so we always struggle a little bit with this definition, because once you reach the
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.520]   escape point from the rat race, once you reach that point of financial freedom or financial
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.960]   independence, my observation is that most people don't actually retire.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.040]   So if you're not going to retire, if you're not going to quit, then how do you know when
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.760]   you hit your goal?
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.840]   Well, it's not financial freedom, not retirement.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.480]   Those are two retirement is for people who hate what they do.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.880]   I love what I do.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.560]   I just want to be free.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   They're very, very different words.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.080]   So it's a very good question.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.600]   But anybody who dreams of retirement really hates their job.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.200]   That's the problem.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:23.520]   So at that point, I was financially free at 47.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.040]   My wife was 37.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   That was in 1994.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.440]   And we just keep doing what we love to do.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.280]   We buy more and more real estate.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.200]   We start more businesses.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.080]   Don't pay any taxes.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.080]   And harass people.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:49.200]   That's why if you read my book, Second Chance, you look at some of the charts there of the
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.800]   Dow for 120 years.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.880]   If that doesn't scare the you know what out of you.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.800]   You know, I would, I would, you know, when you look at 120 years of the Dow, what cracks
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.160]   me up is every time I listen to CNBC, they talk about the giant crash of 1929.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.640]   Well, you can look at the chart of the Dow from 1895 to 2015, you'll see the giant crash
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.360]   of 1929 doesn't even register.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:20.960]   As compared to the crash of 2000, 2000 and 2007 and the one that's coming.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.840]   This crash is so big.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   I mean, if you look at that chart in my book, Second Chance, you won't need coffee for a
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.080]   week.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:38.080]   And especially if you have a 401k or you're counting on, you know, like CalPERS, the state
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.920]   pension plans, they're all bankrupt.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.640]   They're all bust.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:47.200]   You know, three years ago, Obama had to, you know, bail out, I think the Frito or the Twinkies
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.840]   drivers, you know, because their defined contribution plan got wiped out.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.080]   So he bailed out the Twinkie guys.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.560]   It's coming.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.640]   I mean, you know, you can say, well, it's not coming.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.280]   Maybe it won't.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.920]   Just look at the charts, look at the graphs and second chance.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.960]   And you can make up your own mind.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.000]   You know, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.800]   Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think so.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.480]   Just look at the charts, look at the graphs.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.240]   The pictures are worth a thousand words.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.080]   A 10 year old kid can understand it.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.800]   You look at the amount of money printing going on.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.960]   You look at when Social Security goes bust.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.160]   All those charts are in there.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.120]   I'll give you my rebuttal.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:30.960]   So I'm generally pessimistic about the long term future of the United States government
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.480]   as it currently stands.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.800]   However, I, this is my personal opinion.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:41.600]   I don't expect, I don't expect there to be such a dramatic, you know, end of the world
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.720]   as we know it event.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   We're in global war, et cetera.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.280]   I can't quite get to that position.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   Now, I have not read second chance.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.720]   So I'm under equipped for the conversation.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:59.920]   However, having studied a lot of doom and gloom economic prognostication, the major
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.320]   factors that I find to be compelling against the doom and gloom scenario is number one,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.160]   companies are not countries.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.840]   Countries go bankrupt all the time.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.800]   And so I expect over time, the US government to go bankrupt.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.960]   I expect the US government to default on its debt.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:21.120]   That doesn't necessarily impact or influence what the companies that I own shares of might
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.680]   do.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:27.360]   And number two, simply because something is a historical event that doesn't lend indication
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.000]   to the future that something is going to happen again.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.280]   Now, obviously cycles exist, but there's always got to be a causation factor.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:43.440]   And when I look at the world that exists fundamentally, the simple fact that I see is that our currency
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.920]   is humming along perfectly fine.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.640]   The US dollar is the most valued reserve dollar in the world, excuse me, reserve currency
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.280]   in the world.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.920]   Certainly it has its chinks in the armor.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:01.600]   But the basic logical flaw that I see in a lot of economic doom and gloom prognostication
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.440]   is that people say, well, the world has been controlled up to this point by the central
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.560]   banking system.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.280]   And then something's going to happen that's out of their control and then it's all going
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.080]   to fall apart.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.480]   And I don't see how that argument holds water.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.760]   Where am I wrong?
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.680]   It might be right.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.160]   I mean, I'm not here to-- everybody's-- that's why I said there are three financial planners
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.000]   in the world, Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey, and me.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.600]   I use debt.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.640]   I don't pay taxes.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.800]   That's my game.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.280]   You know, if I owned stocks, I'd pay taxes.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.160]   So I don't want to pay taxes.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:48.000]   Can you expand a little bit more of what you mean as far as by the statement, I don't pay
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.400]   taxes?
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   Are you specifically referring to that because of using real estate, you have significant
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.200]   enough depreciation allowances that that reduces your profits?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.320]   Or can you give that answer a little more texture, please?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.760]   I don't have a job, OK?
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.520]   So I don't have a work for money.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:11.600]   So when money comes in, I buy-- like last year, I bought 2,000 units.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.640]   Now, the reason I buy 2,000 units of apartments is because I get-- and I use debt.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.400]   I use depreciation.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.440]   I just depreciate them.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.320]   And so my income is offset by depreciation.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:30.480]   So I have to buy more real estate so I can keep losing money.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.400]   I'll refer the listener to your books on the subject of tax-free wealth.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.240]   I'm not saying do it.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.840]   I'm just saying that's my game.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:49.680]   And if Dave Ramsey lived debt-free and I just borrowed $500 million, a half a billion,
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.040]   obviously he's not going to agree with me either.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.360]   Right.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.000]   Right.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.040]   And this is--
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   And I don't expect anybody to agree with me.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:03.120]   I just started back in 1973 with a little one-bedroom, one-bath house in the island of
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:03.620]   Maui.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.360]   I paid for it with a credit card, and it was 100% debt.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.400]   I made $25.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.760]   And I got to depreciate it.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.640]   Capitalism is a lovely form of making money.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.360]   Right.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.240]   And it's very doable.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.640]   If I got a job, I'd have to pay tax.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.160]   Agreed.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.040]   Agreed.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:23.680]   And it's very doable.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.280]   And just for the listener's sake, the simple concept here is just recognize that borrowed
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.040]   money you don't pay taxes on.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.160]   Because it's not income.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.120]   It's borrowed money.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.400]   So if you can arrange--
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.640]   But the problem is you pay money on stocks.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.240]   I don't pay money on real estate.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.360]   There's a very big difference there.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:45.360]   In fact, I got accelerated depreciation and all those other things that reduced my taxes.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.680]   So it's just a different game.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.720]   And financial education is a very, very big subject.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.840]   So I'm not saying-- that's why I started this whole thing.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.400]   Three people-- Susie, Dave, and myself.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.640]   And somewhere in there, people find their happy camp in there somewhere.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.440]   (laughs)
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.400]   What do you do in your free time that you value the most?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.200]   I probably study a lot.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.640]   There's a book I think everybody should read, but nobody is.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.520]   It's called-- I forget the name-- but it's written by David Stockman.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.360]   It's about 750 pages long.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.080]   If you want to find out why we're in financial trouble, it's that book.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.440]   It's by David Stockman.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.680]   It's "The Great Unraveling of the Great"-- something like that.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.760]   But he's not a doom and gloom guy.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.520]   He just explains stupidity.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.160]   You know, how Greenspan and how Bernanke and all these guys--
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.800]   and Paulson-- just ripped us off, which is my belief anyway.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.840]   You're referring to "The Great Deformation" book?
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.480]   "The Great Deformation" is what it is, yeah.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.440]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.480]   But it's 750 pages.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.720]   And then there's Richard Duncan's book called "The Dollar Crisis,"
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.680]   which explains why China is in trouble.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.280]   But China is no different than Mexico or Indonesia and those guys,
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.720]   and then Japan and why now the United States is next.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.040]   It's all factual.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.000]   Just look at it.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.880]   You can see it coming.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.280]   You can't keep printing money to pay your bills.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.560]   At this point in time, you are still
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.200]   overseer and the head of a very large business.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.800]   And I'm interested to know, what does your normal work day look like from the beginning?
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.480]   I don't have a job.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.840]   I mean, I don't go to work anymore.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.640]   I'm a CEO and a president.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:45.200]   When I said that statement to you that rich don't work for money, I'm living proof of it.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.920]   I don't have an office.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.760]   I sit around and I read.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.800]   And I do stuff like that.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.840]   How did you make the transition?
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   And explain what I'm asking.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.000]   So I run a small business here with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.240]   This is currently squarely in the self-employment quadrant.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.240]   It is not a capital B business.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.480]   It is squarely in the self-employment quadrant.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.040]   However, we're moving in a different direction.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.520]   I'm capitalizing on the resources and assets that I have and the skills
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.480]   and moving in a different direction.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.680]   But one of the most challenging things is making those transitions,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   figuring out how to transition a business from the owner-operator doing all of the work
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.400]   to overseeing an organization.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.280]   Where were the inflection points for you?
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.200]   Where you transitioned little by little?
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.600]   And how did you educate yourself through that process?
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.720]   Well, Josh, I'm not going to give you an answer.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.480]   I'll flip it, but it's true.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.600]   I mean, what I always say, the key to success is incompetence.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:54.880]   So since I'm incompetent, I have to find good people.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.640]   [laughter]
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.400]   Like, you don't find me fixing my car or fixing my teeth or doing any of that stuff.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.160]   It's that I just remain incompetent.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:13.280]   You know, that's a story of how the Huckleberry Finn or Mark Twain,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   they got somebody else to paint the fence for them.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.780]   That's me.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.720]   I get everybody else to paint the fence.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.400]   So you may be incompetent at everything other than finding good people, then,
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.720]   because that is certainly probably one of the most financially valuable skills.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.560]   How did you become competent at finding and attracting the right people to your organization?
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.320]   Well, it's like the same thing.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   If you kiss a lot of frogs, you'll find a prince.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.800]   I went through a lot of bad people.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.000]   Bad people.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.920]   You know, that, what do they call it, bankruptcy owner,
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.760]   that thing they're going after is a bad person.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.480]   I've never been personally bad.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:50.960]   I'm like Trump.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.480]   I've never been personally bankrupt, but I've had a couple of companies go bankrupt.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.640]   And it was always due to bad people, either incompetent or criminal.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.120]   So that's the price you pay.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.000]   And that's why most people stay small is they don't trust other people.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.200]   After the bankruptcy proceedings and the lawsuits and those things were settled,
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.040]   what changes did you make in your business practices?
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.280]   Or you just said, okay, finding bad people.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.840]   Did you make any changes after that based upon what you learned?
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.960]   That's right.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.600]   Of course I did.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.040]   I had to, you know, I can't blame the other guy, if you know what I mean.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.520]   And that one lawsuit, you know, it's because I was an asshole.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.760]   You know, I mean, I caught the guy cheating and all this and I pounded on him.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.720]   And he sued.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.120]   Yeah, just because I was, I didn't do anything wrong per se.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.600]   I just told him he was screwed up.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.440]   And I warned him the crash was coming in 2006.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.240]   And he wouldn't listen and all this.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.280]   And he went down with it.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.960]   And he and I got into a fight.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.800]   I should never have screamed and yelled at him.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.520]   That's what I did.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.680]   So he sued and won.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.180]   Right.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.040]   Anyway, that's what happens in life, you know.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:13.920]   You don't, you don't, you know, you don't go to court to, for settlement.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.480]   You know, you don't go to court for justice or truth.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.680]   You go to court because you want to get rid of somebody in your life.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.800]   And people just lie, lie, lie.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.240]   And that's how you learn.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.040]   You know, so I learned.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.680]   So I don't, I don't get into those arguments.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.480]   I'm, that's why I have my rich dad advisors.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.360]   I might have about eight other guys I do business with.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.960]   And I don't go outside of that group.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.520]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.960]   And if I don't trust them, I don't do business anymore.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.840]   I have two final questions.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:54.240]   I'm interested to know about your writing process and how that's changed since the beginning.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.160]   This is primarily just a personal question.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.280]   Me using the opportunity to ask somebody who's more experienced than I am.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:05.680]   It seems to me like you, your primary skills in watching you are in verbal communication.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.440]   And that's for me, verbal communication is the, is the key skill.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.720]   I struggle at writing.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.080]   And over the years you have attracted to yourself co-authors
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.440]   who've made contributions and rich dad advisors, things like that.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.920]   And then you've effectively used those to build, to build a brand.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.280]   When you sat down in the beginning to write a book,
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.200]   did you write the first one just yourself?
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.760]   And how did you learn to transition from sitting there and arguing with a typewriter to,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:40.720]   I guess, being the face of the brand and using the skills of other people to build it?
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.680]   How did you learn that?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.840]   Well, first of all, I flunked out of high school twice because I can't write.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.360]   So for me to write is a blessing from God someplace.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:56.000]   But it is, I sit there and struggle every morning and that's what I'm doing.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.600]   I just sit there and struggle with me.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:02.880]   There's a book called The War of Art and everybody should get it who wants to be a writer.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:08.640]   It's how you just sit there with a blank screen or a page or a paper.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.520]   And then that's where the battle starts and everybody goes through it.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.640]   So it's called The War of Art.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.480]   I forgot the, I should know his name.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.520]   Steven Pressfield.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.680]   And it's a fantastic book.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.720]   But it's the, it's, anybody who is successful goes through that struggle,
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.200]   whether it's in golf or acting or in medicine or something like this.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:39.680]   And the unsuccessful people don't go through that process regardless what the process is.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.120]   So The War of Art is a great, great book to read and understand.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.520]   Why do you write?
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.960]   Why do you put yourself through that struggle?
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.960]   Well, because that's what my passion is.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.200]   You know, I could, you know, I tell you this, this market's going to come down.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.440]   I've been right every single time.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.200]   We're going to go down and I can see it coming.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.320]   I've been, you can go to my website.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.760]   I did a video called The Man I Could See the Future.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.440]   60 minutes long.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.960]   You can look at it, watch it.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.680]   But I'm calling the crashes and I'm calling this one coming up now.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.360]   I'm on time, on schedule.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.920]   And the people, you know, who go to school and get a job and save money and work hard,
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.040]   they're getting wiped out.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.480]   They're getting wiped out all over the world.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.360]   It breaks my heart.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.400]   So I just keep writing.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:36.400]   I do what I can to, you know, and look, a person does what they have to do.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.680]   You know, you are very accurate.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.960]   A person can only do what they're capable of doing.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:50.080]   So when I talk about how I use debt, I don't pay tax, and I buy this and that,
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.040]   I didn't start that way, but that's what I've learned to become.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.800]   And the average person will not go through that process.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.920]   As you know, as a financial planner, all my friends who are financial planners
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   tell me that most people choose to be poor because they're lazy.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.640]   They work hard, but they're lazy.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.280]   And that's the problem.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:15.120]   - I guess the reason I'm probing on the writing question is you mentioned that writing
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.800]   is difficult, but you say it's your passion.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:22.160]   What is your passion, the writing or the communication of ideas that you think are important?
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.680]   - It's the communication.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.400]   I'm still trying to save my poor dad.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:31.200]   My poor dad went to Stanford, you know, Chicago, Northwestern, he's a PhD.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.800]   At 50, he lost his job.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.760]   He couldn't recover.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.440]   He didn't have the skill sets.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.280]   And who do we listen to in the world today?
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.080]   We listen to guys like Bernanke and Greenspan and Yellen, and these are just like my poor dads,
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.560]   they're academics who don't know the reality and theory.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:56.000]   You know, they should be sent to jail, both Greenspan and Bernanke and Yellen,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.960]   they should go to jail.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:03.760]   You know, as Trump said to Jim Bush, he says, "Your brother should be impeached."
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.320]   But we don't impeach him, we make him heroes.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:12.000]   I mean, you know, I'm a former Marine.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.680]   George Bush destabilized Saddam Hussein and now we have ISIS.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.200]   We should never have gone to war.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:24.240]   And we lose thousands of people and now they'll come get us.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.880]   So when Trump says he should be impeached, I agree with him.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.880]   Other people go, "You know, it wasn't his fault, you know,
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.800]   but he's the guy that gave the orders."
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:39.760]   So all I'm saying is protect yourself and I don't care who gets elected after that.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.440]   You can elect Sanders or you can elect Trump.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.680]   It won't make any difference to me, that's what I'm saying.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.560]   Because I'm not dependent upon their actions for my security.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:58.160]   When you look at your involvement in the personal finance industry, I mean, you have,
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.960]   your Rich Dad brand and 20 years of involvement have seen a lot of people
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.000]   who have been in the business for 20 years,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.400]   who have been in the business for 20 years of involvement,
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.360]   have seen major changes in the last 20 years.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:19.120]   What's the same and what's different as far as the personal finance advice?
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.960]   As I said, everything I said 20 years ago is coming true.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.640]   I don't invest in the stock market.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:28.880]   The 401(k)s are a ripoff and savers are losers and don't look for job security.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.240]   I mean, nothing's really changed.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.880]   They're highly educated people.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:38.400]   Many, many people have lost their 401(k)s and their savings the last crash.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.080]   Many people have lost their houses.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.520]   Nothing I have said has changed.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.080]   It's just that people can't hear you.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.120]   Your house is not an asset.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   What do you mean my house is not an asset?
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.400]   What do you mean don't save money?
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.160]   What do you mean a 401(k) is a ripoff?
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:55.920]   You know, what do you mean don't go to school if you don't get a job?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.560]   Because you're probably going to lose your job anyway.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:03.440]   That's what's happening.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.960]   And you know who pays the most taxes?
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.080]   The people that work for money.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:06.800]   This is true.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.240]   That's the lesson one.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.600]   The rich don't work for money.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.360]   It goes back.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.280]   Nothing's really changed, Josh.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   Everything I said has happened.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.880]   Everything I'm saying has come true.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.320]   Look at 2016.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.040]   It's crashing.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.840]   Well, it's not real.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.280]   We're already in a recession.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.480]   China is about to implode.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:33.920]   And I say, as long as gold's under $1,500, you may want to buy some.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.800]   That's all I said.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:38.560]   Because I think they're going to print more money.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.480]   Now, if I'm wrong, it's going to collapse anyway.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:47.440]   You can't pay off $250 trillion with money you don't have.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.720]   It's just not mathematical possible.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.120]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.360]   There is no mathematical way for the United States government to ever
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.720]   satisfy its debt obligation.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.480]   So I fully agree with you.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.120]   Last question.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.960]   Last question I'd like to ask.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.480]   I thought I'd close this, but it makes it the last question.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:06.960]   Yeah, this is it.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.760]   I appreciate the questions, and I appreciate the in-depthness of them.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.480]   Thank you, Josh.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.040]   Absolutely.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.240]   Ask the question.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.280]   What do you wish your legacy to be?
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.520]   I don't even think about that.
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.440]   I just do what I think I have to do.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.480]   You know, I mean, I don't--
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.920]   I'm really concerned about my fellow human beings.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.800]   You know, we don't learn anything about money at school.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.280]   Nothing.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.320]   Nothing.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:42.720]   If they do learn something, tell them to save money, get a job, work hard,
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.400]   invest in a 401(k).
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.160]   And those are the biggest ripoffs going.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.200]   Now, that's why I started this whole thing.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.560]   Three kinds of advisors.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.280]   Susie, Orman, Dave Ramsey, and myself.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.600]   And that's why I like the title of your show, "Radical Personal Finance."
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.840]   I think we should all get a little bit more radical and think outside the box,
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.880]   because if you're thinking inside the box, you're probably getting wiped out.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.840]   Absolutely.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.640]   And I don't think--
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.720]   You know, Trump's my friend, but he can't save us.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.960]   And Bernie Sanders can't save us.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.920]   And neither can Hillary.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.040]   So you better do something.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.960]   The very best thing that could happen for Donald Trump would be for him to go far in the--
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.360]   to go far in the primary--
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.000]   or in the primary process, or perhaps even the election process,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:24.640]   and then lose.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.080]   Because whoever is elected as the next president of the United States
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.680]   will face a major problem.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.200]   And I pity the man or woman who becomes president.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.520]   The next president's going to be the skipper of a Titanic.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.720]   That's why I agree with it.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.440]   Right.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.120]   Well, richdad.com is your website.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.400]   You do Rich Dad Radio.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.600]   The book-- you said your latest book is "Second Chance."
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.880]   Anything else that you're excited about that you'd like for the listeners to check out?
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.520]   I would check out some of the videos, especially on CNN in 2008,
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.960]   when I was calling for the fall of Lehman and Goldman and all those guys.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.200]   It's-- I recorded all that stuff since then.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.160]   And so I said, "2016's the next crash, and on schedule, 2016 is crashing."
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.480]   Robert Kisiaki, thank you for coming on.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.000]   Thank you very much, Josh.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.760]   Fascinating to hear the inside story from someone who's been around for so long.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.960]   Hope you enjoyed that interview.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   I hope you can take some of the information that Robert shared.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.120]   Hey, you got to do what you got to do for your own situation.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.800]   Learn from everybody.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.600]   But you got to apply it in your own situation.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.640]   So be careful.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.160]   Make your decisions carefully.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.200]   Be thoughtful.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.920]   Do your homework.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.120]   Do your own research.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.880]   So, Robert, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.720]   Welcome any of you who have found the show because of Robert Kisiaki.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.320]   He's a big name, so I'm sure there's many new listeners to the show.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.120]   If you've not heard of Radical Personal Finance, make sure you subscribe to the show.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.600]   We do the show-- try to hit about five days a week.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.120]   Usually it's probably about four.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.720]   We do the show here Monday through Friday, about four or five episodes a week.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.240]   And we talk about living a rich life now and building financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.560]   Work through technical questions.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.840]   Work through big picture questions.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.280]   We talk about entrepreneurship.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.320]   We talk about tax planning.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.760]   We talk about living rich.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.960]   We talk about living poor.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.680]   We talk about what you can learn from dumpster divers and hobos.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   I need to do another one of those shows again.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.760]   And also we need to talk about what you can learn from billionaires.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.520]   And I need to do more of those shows because I have-- that's probably the little tag that
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.960]   I've not done the best job on.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.160]   So if this is your first time here, please make sure you subscribe to the show.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.600]   You can find it in iTunes.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   Or the easiest thing is just search the App Store on your phone for Radical Personal Finance.

[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.040]   I am device company agnostic.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.920]   I don't care if it's Windows or Blackberry or Android or Google or-- what's the other one?
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.800]   Fire.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.920]   My wife has a Fire phone.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.600]   I don't care which of those-- Amazon Fire.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.720]   I don't care which of those it is.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.560]   Just check-- search the App Store for Radical Personal Finance and you will find a free
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.040]   mobile app with all of the past shows.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.080]   Thank you all for listening.

[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:14.880]   be possible.
