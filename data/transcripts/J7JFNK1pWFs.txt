[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.360]   - The Bible is full of about 20 major themes
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.380]   and another 50 to 70 smaller ones.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.580]   And when it comes to explaining how each theme
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.540]   develops from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.100]   I don't know of anyone who does it better
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.740]   than Dr. Don Carson.
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.460]   On Select Fridays, we release a little longer episode
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.500]   than normal where we call up Dr. Carson,
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.340]   he takes a theme and explains it to us.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.800]   We have now done this five times with an episode
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.360]   on what is biblical theology,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.120]   which was a good sort of overview of this sort of thing.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.480]   Then we recorded an overview of the whole Bible,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.560]   which was very popular, as you can imagine,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.020]   thank you for the response.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.720]   It was then followed by a theology of creation,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.140]   a theology of the temple,
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.780]   and then a theology of resurrection
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.480]   just a few days before Easter.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.940]   And each of those episodes can be found on the APJ app,
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.920]   just search the word Carson.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.320]   It has been a great series, well-received,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.420]   and we've only begun.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.480]   Dr. Carson joins us again today over the phone,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.960]   which is the fruit of our partnership
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.280]   with our friends at the Gospel Coalition.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.600]   Carson is the co-founder and president
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.840]   of the Gospel Coalition,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.180]   and also the editor of the NIV Zondervan Study Bible,
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.720]   which is the study Bible version
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.200]   of what we're doing in these podcasts.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.860]   I called Dr. Carson at his home office
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.680]   and asked him to share with us a whole Bible theology
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.920]   of the theme of sin.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.920]   Here's what he said.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.280]   - In one sense, what the Bible says about sin
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   is so comprehensive that it's really challenging
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.160]   to get to the heart of the issue in 10 minutes or so.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.760]   Virtually every page of the Bible
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.400]   says something implicitly or explicitly about sin.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.760]   One thing it does not say
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.360]   is that sin was there in the beginning.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.280]   Sin is portrayed in Genesis 3 as rebellion.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.360]   It's not that matter is intrinsically sinful, for example.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920]   Sin is portrayed as doubting God's word.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   Has God said, or it's involved with mocking God,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.320]   standing in a position where we can criticize God.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.080]   God knows that if you eat this fruit,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.320]   then you'll be like him,
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.800]   and he doesn't want you to be like him.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.780]   He's jealous and narrow-minded and rather bigoted.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.320]   Sin is first and foremost rebellion against God
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   and what he has disclosed of himself in words.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   And that notion of sin prevails in one fashion or another
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.360]   across the entire sweep of scripture.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.060]   The reason why it's important to think clearly about sin
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.080]   is manifold, but in particular,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.040]   to think clearly about sin
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.160]   helps you to think clearly about salvation and the Savior.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.080]   The problematic of the Bible storyline,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.740]   the problem that is addressed by the Bible storyline
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.560]   is the problem of sin.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.880]   And the solution that is presented
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.180]   in the coming of Christ and in his work
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.920]   must match the problem itself.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.920]   If the fundamental problem of humankind is bad economics,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.000]   then what we need is a superb economist.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   If the supreme need of humankind is good health,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.760]   then what we need is superb medical facilities.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.000]   But if the supreme problem is sin,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   then what we need is a salvation that addresses sin,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.480]   not only the concrete acts of rebellion,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.320]   but all of its effects,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   including alienation and suffering and sickness and war
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.280]   and hate and finally death itself and hell.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.600]   The notion of sin in scripture
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.800]   is the notion of what is wrong with the universe
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.760]   and therefore constitutes what it is
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.200]   that God is sending his son to address.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.160]   Now, within that framework,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.760]   it's easy to start teasing out the Bible storyline
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.840]   in terms of sin.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   So after Genesis 3 and the temptation of Adam and Eve,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.000]   Genesis 4, you have the first murder, a fratricide.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.480]   By the time you get to Genesis 5,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.920]   you have the repetition of the phrase,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.440]   and he died and he died and he died and he died,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.920]   which is the entailment of sin.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.760]   When you sin, you will die.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.920]   And then Genesis 6 to 9, the flood account,
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   which is generated by God's disgust
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.040]   and hatred of sin and its pervasive judgment
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.160]   attracting evil across the face of the earth.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.400]   And so on, right through the biblical accounts
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.200]   of the stories of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   the patriarchs and the story of Joseph and so on,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.080]   all of which take up the rest of the book of Genesis.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.960]   Abraham was a man of faith.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.120]   He was a godly man.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.400]   He was also a liar.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.080]   The 12 patriarchs include 10 who are trying to decide
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   between killing and selling into slavery, the 11th,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.760]   and Judah, who is ultimately the great, great,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.240]   great grandfather of King David
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.040]   and ultimately of Christ himself,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.600]   is busy sleeping with a stepdaughter.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.520]   Sin is interwoven into the accounts.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.560]   And one could similarly go through Exodus and Leviticus
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.240]   with its sacrificial systems to deal with impurity
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.920]   and sin of various kinds.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.240]   Everything turns on the pervasiveness of sin.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.800]   And then one comes to the book of Judges
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   and we witness the cycling down of periods of reformation
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.560]   as people are broken and they cry to God for help
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   and God restores them by raising up a judge
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.000]   and bringing about some measure of purity into the land.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   Again, within a generation and a half or so,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.640]   things spiral down to idolatry and perversity and so on,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.600]   until you get to the last three chapters
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.920]   of the book of Judges.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.720]   And they're so grotesque that even the so-called good guys
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.800]   are pretty horrendous and it's hard to read
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.400]   those chapters in public.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.000]   So we could proceed through the kings and the prophets
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.880]   and so on and witness the pervasiveness of all of this.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.160]   But let me instead direct your attention
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.360]   to a few passages of scripture
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.040]   that are in many ways determinative.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.080]   In Exodus chapter 34, verses six and seven,
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.760]   God intones certain words to Moses
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   as Moses is hidden in a cleft in the rock
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.480]   so that he cannot see God.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.200]   He's later permitted to peek out
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.920]   and see something of the trailing edge
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.040]   of the afterglow of the glory of the Lord.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.360]   But as God goes by and intones certain words,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   there is a built-in tension in what God says.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.960]   This is in Exodus chapter 34.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.360]   On the one hand, God presents himself
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   as a God of immeasurable mercy and grace.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.920]   God says, "The Lord, the Lord,
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.880]   the compassionate and gracious God,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.760]   slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.120]   maintaining love to thousands,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.000]   forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin."
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.280]   That's the one side.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.520]   On the other side,
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.120]   "Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.960]   He punishes the children and their children
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.040]   for the sin of the parents
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.840]   to the third and fourth generation."
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.680]   At the end of the day,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.600]   that tension is not really finally resolved
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.200]   until you get to the New Testament and the cross,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.800]   or another passage that gives a lot of insight.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.400]   In Psalm 51, we find David penning this Psalm of contrition
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.560]   after his horrible lapse,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   seducing Bathsheba, murdering her husband,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.200]   corrupting the military, betraying his family,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.480]   lying about everything,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.160]   until finally he's confronted by the prophet Nathan
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.920]   and comes to real deep repentance.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.440]   But there is a lot of damage
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.840]   that's been done just the same.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.960]   One of the most intriguing things that he says,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.880]   however, in Psalm 51 is found in verse four.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.440]   He begins in verse one by saying,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.640]   "Have mercy on me, O God,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.680]   according to your unfailing love,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.480]   according to your great compassions,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.640]   blot out my transgressions.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.360]   Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin."
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.880]   The man really knows how guilty he is.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.640]   "I know my transgressions.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   My sin is always before me."
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.960]   And then he says, verse four,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.760]   "Against you, you only have I sinned
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.800]   and done what is evil in your sight."
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.440]   So you are right in your verdict
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.240]   and justified when you judge.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.040]   But the truth of the matter is that at one level,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.880]   the reader is tempted to say,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.200]   "Come on, David, how can you say
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.760]   that you've sinned only against God?
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.160]   You've sinned against Bathsheba, you seduced her.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.000]   And you've sinned against Uriah the Hittite, surely.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.840]   You had him killed.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   You've sinned against the military high command.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.960]   You corrupted them.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.560]   You sinned against the nation
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.240]   in that you're the chief magistrate
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.560]   and you fail at a fundamental level.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.960]   You sinned against your own family.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.800]   You betrayed them.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.960]   It's hard to think of anybody you didn't sin against.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.120]   Then you say, "Against you only," addressing God,
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.720]   "Have I sinned and done this evil in your sight?"
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.840]   Yet at another level, that is exactly the point.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.080]   What makes sin so heinous is not all of its,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.520]   shall we call them, horizontal dimensions,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.400]   but that it is defiance of God.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.200]   It is not loving God with heart and soul
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.640]   and mind and strength.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.800]   If David had loved God with heart and soul
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.640]   and mind and strength,
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.560]   he wouldn't have committed any of these sins.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.840]   In all of our sins,
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.320]   whether it's cheating on our income tax
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.480]   or nurturing bitterness
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.920]   or succumbing to fits of rage or jealousy
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.960]   or anything else,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.120]   God is always the most offended party.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.000]   That means in Scripture,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.280]   whatever else we must have,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.040]   we must have forgiveness from God.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.240]   The heart of the worst effects of sin
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.600]   is being alienated from God,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.880]   cut off from him who is our maker
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.200]   and the giver of life.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.080]   If he stands against us,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.600]   then we are lost.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.880]   We are undone.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.520]   So although the Bible does stress
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.120]   the importance of reconciliation
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.520]   at the horizontal level,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.000]   the heart of the Bible's storyline
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.640]   is how sinful human beings
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.800]   made in the image of God,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.040]   alienated from him,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.720]   deserving of his wrath,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.320]   nevertheless can be reconciled to him,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.480]   which brings us again and again
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   back to the gospel of the cross
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.560]   and resurrection of Christ.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.960]   Some other things need to be said briefly
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.200]   about the Bible's storyline.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.840]   Sin tends to be a generic word for evil,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   but there are other words
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.800]   that overlap in semantic range,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.120]   in the range of meaning with sin,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.120]   but have some sort of specialized focus.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.280]   Idolatry, for example,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.680]   shows how sin erects a false God.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.320]   It displaces God.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.080]   One could track out the significance
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.520]   of idolatry right through the Bible.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.200]   The New Testament can insist
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.920]   that greed is idolatry
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.880]   because what you want strongly enough
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.600]   becomes God for you,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.360]   and God becomes de-Godded.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.400]   Or another word is transgression.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   Now, it's not evil in some summary sense.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.240]   It's actually going against,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.520]   crossing over, transgressing
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.760]   the boundaries that God has put in place.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.840]   It is doing what he prohibits.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   It is failing to do what he explicitly commands.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.480]   So there's transgression and iniquity
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   and failure and dirt.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.000]   There are many different words
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.880]   that describe sin,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.640]   and all of them together
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.440]   need to be thought through.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.880]   Now, in that connection,
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.160]   then, there are related theological notions
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.600]   that need to be borne in mind.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.120]   For example, the wrath of God.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.440]   About 600 times in the Bible,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.320]   in the Old Testament alone, in fact,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   apart from the occurrences in the New Testament,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.480]   the Bible speaks of God's wrath.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.680]   This does not mean that God is bad-tempered
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.600]   or loses it or anything of that sort.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.760]   His wrath is not an intrinsic part of his character
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.800]   the way his love is.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.600]   His wrath is the outworking of his holiness
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.520]   when he confronts sin.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.000]   And if God did not express wrath,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.520]   condemnation, judgment on sin,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.640]   he would not be thereby nicer.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.040]   He would be morally indifferent.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.000]   He would not become morally attractive.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.240]   He would become irrelevant to questions of truth
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.560]   and integrity and morality,
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.840]   both in this life and in the life to come.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.200]   Then there are other elements of sin
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.840]   that we should think about.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.640]   For example, the prophet Habakkuk can ask the question,
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.040]   "I understand," he says, in effect,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.600]   "how God might use a wicked nation
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.360]   "to punish another wicked nation.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.080]   "But how can he use a nation that seems to be more wicked
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.560]   "to punish a nation that is,
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.960]   "on any measurable front, less wicked?"
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.640]   And he's thinking about how his own people,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.040]   the Israelites, are being punished
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   by the regional superpowers of his day,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.480]   which on any measurement are more wicked.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.680]   And that raises some fundamental questions,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.320]   which he resolves finally by going into the temple
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.360]   and being convinced of the goodness of the Lord
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.200]   and of an eschatological reconciliation on the last day.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.000]   There are other pictures of sin.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.400]   Apostasy, for example,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.680]   seen as a kind of spiritual adultery.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.480]   All of these pictures come together.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.120]   In Matthew chapter 11, verses 20 and following,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.080]   the grievousness of guilt is tied in part
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.000]   to how much revelation we've already received.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.160]   So in that connection, Capernaum and Bethsaida,
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.520]   cities which witnessed a great deal of Christ's gospel,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.520]   preaching, and powerful miracles,
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.240]   will stand more condemned in a worse place on the last day
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.120]   than Sodom and Gomorrah, or pagan cities like Tyre and Sidon,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.480]   or to put it in contemporary terms,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.400]   it may well be then that on the last day,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.720]   Kabul, Afghanistan, will be in a less dangerous place
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.040]   than Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.360]   It really is important to see that the doctrine of sin
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.120]   in scripture is really very complex.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.320]   It's not just a matter of bean counting.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.680]   It includes very complex notions
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.360]   that only God himself can finally sort out,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.080]   in which guilt is tied, at least in part,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.600]   to how we have done, what we have done
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.760]   with the revelation that we have received.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.320]   And all of this presupposes a universality, too,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.000]   in the very interesting comments of the Lord Christ
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.320]   in Luke chapter 13, verses one to five,
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.000]   where Jesus reminds the people of the tower
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.080]   that fell on a number of people and crushed 18 of them,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.400]   or where he talks about those whose blood
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.080]   was mingled with the blood of the sacrifices.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.200]   In both cases, he asks the question,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.720]   do you think that these people who thus suffered
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.720]   were more wicked, more sinful,
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.920]   than others who did not similarly suffer?
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.080]   And it's a bit like asking,
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.160]   do you think that the people who came down
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.160]   in the Twin Towers on 9/11 were more wicked
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.040]   than everybody else in America?
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.080]   And Jesus does not say, oh, they're not wicked at all.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.680]   What he says is, unless you repent,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.000]   all of you will similarly perish.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.520]   In other words, the disasters,
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.520]   whether made by human beings or so-called natural disasters,
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:09.000]   are marks of judgment that is deserved by everybody.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.640]   And it's of the Lord's mercies we're not consumed.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.320]   And that eventually sets us up for the long, long passage,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.200]   Romans 118 to 320, which begins,
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.240]   "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.320]   against all human wickedness."
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.520]   Human beings suppressing the truth and so forth.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.280]   Section after section is taken up with proving
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.080]   that Jews are guilty before God
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.480]   and Gentiles are guilty before God.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.680]   We're all shameful and dirty and sullied
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   until you get the concatenation of biblical quotations
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:53.040]   from Romans 3, 9 or thereabouts to 320,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   all verses that are designed to prove
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.280]   that human beings are lost and guilty.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.560]   Reminds me of some passages in the Old Testament.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.840]   I occasionally set myself to memorize a psalm
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   or something like that.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.960]   And one I've been working on recently is Psalm 36.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.080]   I have a message from God in my heart
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.480]   concerning the sinfulness of the wicked.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.680]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.600]   In their own eyes, they flatter themselves too much
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.480]   to detect or hate their sin.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.440]   That's almost a description of contemporary culture.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.920]   We flatter ourselves too much to detect or hate our sin.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.320]   The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.560]   They fail to act wisely or do good.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.440]   Even on their beds, they plot evil.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.800]   They commit themselves to a sinful course
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.120]   and do not reject what is wrong.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.960]   But when one is finished with all of these reflections
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.840]   on sin and one tracks out the myriad lines
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.840]   that describe sin across the entire biblical canon,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.120]   one cannot help but remember that at the end
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.520]   of the long passage in Romans 1, 18 to 320,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   comes one of the most glorious atonement passages
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.560]   in all of Holy Scripture, Romans 3, 21 to 26,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.760]   where God takes action in Christ Jesus and his dead,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   both to justify the ungodly and to be just himself
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.520]   in the sacrifice of his own dear son,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.800]   a sacrifice that simultaneously turns aside God's wrath.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   It propitiates God and it cancels sin, it expiates sin.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.480]   Until you come to the final two chapters
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.600]   and the portrait of a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.480]   where part of the glory of the portrait
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.080]   is that there is no more sin, no more death,
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.920]   no more decay, no more fear, no more shame.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.680]   The glory of the Lamb is everything
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.920]   and God's people will see his face.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.440]   And here then finally is the abolition
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.980]   of all sin and its effects.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.640]   Grounded in the triumph of the Lion's Lair.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.760]   - So good and rich.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.660]   This is world-class biblical theology made to look so easy.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.620]   That was Don Carson from his home office,
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.520]   joining us again by way of our partnership
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.820]   with our friends over at The Gospel Coalition.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.760]   Carson, of course, is the co-founder
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.600]   and president of The Gospel Coalition.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.040]   We now break for the weekend,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.000]   and this weekend feel free to look back
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.360]   on the episodes from the week,
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.460]   search our archive of hundreds of episodes,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.040]   download the app, subscribe to the podcast,
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.840]   or even send us a question of your own.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   Do all of that at our landing page,
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.480]   desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   And of course, you can find all the episodes
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.340]   with Dr. Carson in the app.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.960]   Just search for his name, Carson,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.760]   and you will find them there.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.320]   I'll see you on Monday with author
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   and longtime pastor, John Piper.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.280]   We'll see you then.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:08.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
