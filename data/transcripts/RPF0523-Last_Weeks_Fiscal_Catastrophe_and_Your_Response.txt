[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.840]   I try to keep Radical Personal Finance positive and uplifting and encouraging and motivating. I
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.920]   really do. It's important to me to be a source of solutions and ideas rather than a source of
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.800]   complaining and whining. But I think we've all got a dark side and today, well, if you're looking for
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.440]   encouragement, you might want to skip today's show.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement, I guess, sort of, of a type, that you need to live a rich and
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.280]   meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.560]   My name is Joshua and I am your host and today let's indulge our dark sides just a little bit
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.840]   because life has seasons and not everything is always rosy.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.440]   Today's show, I want to talk with you about the recent budget deal that the United States
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.760]   government has come together and passed. And this is just one of those things that I've been
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.200]   watching to see what would happen, but this is a nightmare and I think we need to face it head on.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.800]   Now, as we begin, I will end the show with some positive ideas and the bulk of my focus for today's
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.240]   show is actually going to give you just some, I have a list of 10 things that I think that you
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.040]   can and I can do that will help us to weather the storms that are coming in the United States over
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   the coming decades. But in watching the political process over the last couple of weeks, I have
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.800]   become fully persuaded that fiscal doom in the United States is, well, pretty much guaranteed.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   Now, I've done a show on it here and there, but frankly, I've always tried to keep my,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.360]   tried to keep myself positive because there are so many metrics by which if we look around,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   we can measure positive improvements in the world. So many metrics. And I spend most of my
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.960]   time thinking about those metrics. Long-term, I'm an optimist, but optimism and pessimism
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.720]   really are, I think, poor, they're useful as concepts in a place, but really there are times
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   at which most of the time realism is what's important, to see things how they actually are.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.880]   I think it's every bit as foolish to go around saying that things are terrible,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.280]   things are terrible, things are terrible, as it is to going around saying things are great,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.760]   things are great, things are great. Life is much more complicated than that. Sometimes things are
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.800]   good, sometimes things are bad. Sometimes things are good for now and they're bad for longer.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.320]   Sometimes things are bad for now and things are good for longer. But I have become increasingly
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.680]   concerned with the fiscal situation in the United States of America. And I think that
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   it's important to talk about it again in light of the budget deal. Now, I did a show on this
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.480]   few months ago. And one of the things that I received back was some feedback of people saying,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.000]   "Oh, Joshua, you've got it wrong." It may be that I've got it wrong. I'm certainly no expert in
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.160]   everything. I'm just a normal person with a slightly higher than average exposure to
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.760]   financial matters. And I'm doing my best to call it the way that I see it. If I am wrong, I hope
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.400]   that I'm wrong. But I think it's a form of cowardice to keep your mouth shut constantly
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.440]   when you see danger and see things that are concerning. And when we put together some of
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.200]   the recent events in the United States, I think there are long-term dangers. I think it'd be
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.760]   helpful. Let's start today with David Stockman's article recently published called "The Night of
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.400]   Fiscal Infamy," because I think this is probably one of the more succinct ways for me to get across
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.880]   the mood that I have. Of course, I could read dozens of articles. But David Stockman is – if
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.400]   you're not familiar with the name, he writes his website, DavidStockman'sContraCorner.com,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.680]   and he publishes a newsletter. And he has an interesting background. He was the director of
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.080]   the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, which is an interesting – I'm not
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.240]   sure whether that's a benefit for him or not since President Reagan basically destroyed the fiscal
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.680]   situation in the United States worse than every president before him for years. And then since
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.240]   then, we've just been getting worse and worse and worse. He left Washington and he went on to work
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.640]   on Wall Street, and now he basically focuses on publishing his newsletter. But let me just lead
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.320]   off by reading his article. This is called "The Night of Fiscal Infamy," posted on Friday,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.200]   February 9th, 2018. "We have crossed the fiscal rubicon, and not merely because Congress passed a
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.880]   $400 billion budget buster in the wee hours of the morning rather than abide a government shutdown
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.480]   beyond sunrise, and also not merely because the deficit is now locked in at $1.2 trillion,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.840]   or 6% of GDP, during what would be the tail-end 10th year of the business expansion,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.160]   fiscal year 2019, or that it is on a path to doubling the national debt to $40 trillion
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:49.040]   during what will be the 2020s decade of demographic no return, i.e. 30 million more retirees on Social
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.480]   Security and Medicare. What really happened is that the politics of the budget have now become
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.920]   even worse than the numbers. In a word, the GOP congressional leadership surrendered control of
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.760]   the nation's finances to Chuckles Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Donald Trump, the military-industrial
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.520]   complex, and the domestic spending lobbies of every shape and form. The conservative fiscal
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.920]   opposition, what was left of it, has been obliterated. Indeed, if the budget is a battlefield,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.800]   and we can testify that it's exactly that, last night amounted to the Battle of the Little Big
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.000]   Horn for the Freedom Caucus. Eight years on from the Tea Party uprising of 2010,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   they, like General Custer and his 200 men, are gathering flies where they fell on the steps of
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.200]   the Capitol at 5 a.m. In that context, the House vote split tells you everything you need to know.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.000]   The faithless Speaker of the House rounded up every rhino, Republican in name only,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.040]   careerist time-server, fiscal hypocrite, bloodthirsty defense hawk, and double-talking
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.760]   pork-barrel Paul that he could muster from the GOP caucus until he had 167 yes votes on the
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.480]   board. He then opened his hand to the Dems, who quickly delivered the 51 votes needed
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.400]   to approve the bill and eventually threw in 22 more for good measure.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.880]   Then and there, of course, the swamp creatures took control of the U.S. Treasury,
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.160]   even as Speaker Ryan sent the 67 Republican no votes out back of the Capitol to be shot.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.640]   Here's the thing. Mitch McConnell is a 54-year swamp creature, and Paul Ryan is a gutless wonder.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.400]   So when Mitchells and Chuckles, as we labeled them yesterday, proffered their
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.920]   bipartisan deal in the Senate, Ryan had the choice of one, saying "hell no" and standing
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.280]   firm for a plan based on some semblance of GOP fiscal principles and GOP votes,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.440]   or two, sentencing the Freedom Caucus to an ignominious end. The finality of it, in fact,
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.160]   lies in the insidious essence of the deal, which is now the law of the land. To wit,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.120]   the bill puts Washington on fiscal holiday until at least March 1, 2019, and in the interim,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.560]   the red ink emanating from the U.S. Treasury will rise like the floodwaters of Houston last summer.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.080]   There will be no stopping it. That's because in the short run, the debt ceiling is suspended
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.560]   for 13 months. The Trump Treasury will therefore have open-ended, limitless borrowing authority,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.480]   and no reason whatsoever to heed demands from the walking wounded of the Freedom Caucus for action,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.080]   any action, to curtail the federal deficit. The only tool they ever had,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:33.280]   leveraging debt ceiling increases, is now dead and gone. Likewise, the sequester caps are lifted
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   for the next two years, meaning the way has been cleared for pork-laden appropriations bills for
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.680]   fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Accordingly, there will be no more shutdown showdowns and no
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.080]   more continuing resolution leverage for fiscal conservatives either. Instead, discretionary
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.840]   spending, which has been creeping slowly higher every year due to last-minute end runs around the
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:06.000]   caps, will now literally erupt. Over the next two years, defense spending will leap by $82 billion
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.840]   annually, and the price the neocons and military hawks paid for that was a parallel $66 billion
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   surge in domestic appropriations, thereby re-establishing the "parity principle" by
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.360]   which the warfare state and the welfare state crushed the nation's fiscal accounts.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.160]   Defense In this instance, however, you have to ask
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.880]   exactly what was the defense emergency that gave rise to this hideous bargain. After all,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.600]   the old capped levels, which reached back to the Boehner-Obama deal of 2011, will never again be
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.320]   revisited. Rather than spending $13.5 trillion on discretionary programs over the next decade,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:58.960]   it will now be $16 trillion or more. But consider this, the entire GDP of North Korea is just $30
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:08.000]   billion. So the Department of Defense increase alone is 2.7 times the entire economy of the only
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.840]   hostile foreign power that has actually threatened, verbally, the US in recent years.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:21.440]   In fact, when you add up the defense budget of all the alleged hostiles, China $215 billion,
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:33.200]   Russia $69 billion, Iran $12 billion, and the entire GDP of North Korea, you get $325 billion.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:42.320]   That's less than 45% of the $716 billion bonanza bestowed on the Defense Department last night.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.520]   Next, add in the defense budgets of Saudi Arabia, $64 billion, India, $56 billion,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:57.440]   France, $56 billion, the United Kingdom, $48 billion, Japan, $44 billion, Germany,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:06.320]   $41 billion, South Korea, $37 billion, and Italy, $28 billion, and guess what? You still have less,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:15.280]   $700 billion, than the DOD's cornucopia of budget resources. Yet, as that heroic American
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.200]   Senator Rand Paul said during his filibuster last night, nobody would be talking about defense
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.800]   budgets this crazy big if we were not conducting seven different wars, all of them completely
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.560]   pointless and irrelevant to the safety and security of the American people. Stated differently,
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.400]   the military-industrial-congressional complex is now ruling the roost and has swallowed up
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.800]   most of the fiscal opposition, which was populated with neocons, militarists, and war hawks.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.320]   That means, in turn, that it will be absolutely impossible to cut a single dime of domestic
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   spending as far as the eye can see. Moreover, given the rather certain explosion of debt service
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.760]   costs to more than $1 trillion by the middle of the coming decade and the baby boom-driven
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:10.960]   entitlement wave, federal outlays are heading toward 26.5% of GDP or higher. That compares
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:18.560]   to just 21% in the most recent year completed, fiscal year 2017. At the same time, the drastically
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:26.240]   front-loaded tax cut will reduce revenue to just 16.5% of GDP in the year ahead. The math of it
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:35.600]   is that the U.S. is now heading for a 10% of GDP deficit on a long-run basis. Worse still,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:41.520]   there is now no process available to slow the drift toward calamity. As a result of last night's
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.560]   action on a two-year budget deal, the congressional Republicans can now dispense with a budget
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.280]   resolution for fiscal year 2019 entirely, even though it is notionally required as a legal matter.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:00.560]   That will spare them of the inconvenience of voting for a red-ink-saturated 10-year fiscal plan,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:07.360]   along with the political shame of it. In effect, they have now institutionalized trillion-dollar
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:14.160]   annual deficits as far as the eye can see, added $15 trillion to the public debt in the next decade
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.520]   alone, and left the U.S. with $35 trillion of public debt and a $2 trillion annual budget
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   deficit by 2027, which happens to be the peak year of baby boom retirements. And that, of course,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   assumes no recession in the interim. Since we don't believe for a moment that the current
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   faltering business expansion will last for a record 219 months or double the previous longest
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:51.680]   expansion in recorded history, the true fiscal facts will ultimately be a lot worse. At the same
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:59.040]   time, no fiscal year 2019 budget resolution also means no chance whatsoever for entitlement reform,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.240]   not even a minor beating up on food stamp recipients on behalf of stronger work requirements,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.600]   which would only save a couple of billion per year anyway. That's because without reconciliation,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.680]   getting any reform package through the 60-vote Senate filibuster has less chance than a snowball
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:22.400]   in the hot place. So now the bond market will be tested like never before. During fiscal year 2019,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:29.280]   starting in October, the U.S. Treasury will borrow $1.2 trillion, and there will be no
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:36.720]   possible legislative action to stop it. And that will occur even as the Fed dumps $600 billion
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:43.120]   of existing debt back into the market. Unless the law of supply and demand has been stealthily
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.960]   repealed by the economic gods, a conflagration of biblical proportions in the bond pits is now
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:57.840]   unavoidable. And when the 10-year yield hits 3.5% and then 4.5%, it will be Katy bar the door in the
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.360]   entire casino, because nothing like the drastic collision ahead is priced into equities or
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   anything else. Accordingly, if you want to grasp how the Fed's bubble finance and destruction of
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.520]   honest price discovery have left the casino defenseless in the face of the reckoning just
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:19.920]   ahead, you can't really find a better illustration than the recent ionization of the XIV. As the
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:26.160]   estimable Doug Cass summarized it, "Indeed, it took a bit over six years for XIV, an inverse
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:37.440]   VIX product, to rise from $10 to $144, but only one day for the product's price to implode to zero."
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.160]   As blogger Quoth the Raven tweeted this morning, "Six years of picking up pennies in front of a
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.400]   bulldozer wiped away in one session." That's what happens when bubbles burst, and we are now sitting
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.280]   on the mother of all financial bubbles. As we argued on Fox Business today, what happened on
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.200]   the floor of the house yesterday may finally be the red swan. At the least, it will prove to be a
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.960]   major inflection point in ending the financial fantasies of the last three decades. We called it
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:14.400]   the night of fiscal infamy, and it surely was. End of article. Now, the first question that most
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.720]   people ask with regard to articles like this, discussions like this, is, "Well, what do I do
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:31.920]   about my investments?" Let me clear that question right now. I have no idea. Go ask someone else and
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.840]   try to find their answer, because I have no idea. I can make a number of arguments that
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:44.720]   countries are not companies. I believe that's true. I can make a number of arguments that would
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.120]   say, "Well, things always work out in the long run." I believe that's true. But I have no idea,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.320]   and guess what? Neither does anybody else. We're all just making guesses.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:05.680]   But we are in a world that has become completely unconnected from anything in history with regard to
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.960]   government spending. How is that going to impact your investments? I don't know.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:19.680]   I don't know. I don't know if anyone else really knows, because David Stockman, for all of his
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:27.280]   experience and his clarity, may very well be wrong for years in terms of what he expects.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.840]   I certainly have been wrong in my predictions. I thought there was good, strong evidence
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:42.720]   that the United States would, during the calendar year 2016 or 2017, would go ahead and enter
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:50.640]   into recession again. It felt long overdue to me. I was wrong, totally wrong. Now, are we entering
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.680]   into recession right now, or the stock market gyration to the last couple of weeks indicators
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.560]   of anything? I don't know. What I do know is I have no idea about what the next few months will
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.960]   look like or that even the next few years will look like. But it seems to me pretty clear that
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.080]   over the coming decades, we, at least in the United States and many other places in the world,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.960]   will face major societal upheaval. And one contributing factor to that is going to be
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:28.880]   the spending of the U.S. federal government. Now, the last time I did a show like this,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.960]   I received a number of emails from very intelligent and thoughtful listeners
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   suggesting to me that I am undereducated in this particular area. That may be true.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:52.720]   But essentially, what was recommended was that there are no limits to government spending. There
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.160]   is no problem with governments running eternal deficits, that because of the taxing power and
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.640]   because of the fact that federal debts never have to be paid off, that there are no problems for the
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   long term. Well, I was trained that way too. I was taught by Keynesians when I was in college,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.320]   but I've come to think that basically the same suspension of any rationality that's required for
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   most of the modern scientific things that are supposedly taught by experts applies to fiscal
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:27.360]   management. Basically, more and more, it seems like many people who want to be leaders on
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:34.480]   various questions of scientific investigation, and I'm happy to lodge economics under one area
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.280]   of scientific investigation. That's more of a social science than it is a hard science.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:45.440]   But basically, what so many people want you and me to do is to deny any bit of our practical
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.800]   experience and to deny any appreciation of history and to fundamentally say,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:57.760]   "Well, you just got to go along because the experts say so." Well, I may not understand,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.440]   but at the end of the day, I got to figure out what do I do in my life.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   And things don't look very bright over the next few decades, at least not from my perspective.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:17.360]   It's a little bit hard for me to take politicians seriously when in the recent discussion over
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   discussion. What discussion? When nobody actually sits down and says,
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   "Are we going to cut spending anywhere?" Here's what's happening. Everything is interrelated.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.840]   I don't see clearly enough in order to articulate all of the interrelations, but
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.000]   we spend so much of our time in the US American culture arguing about politics and money,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.960]   money as it relates to politics. Because of course, politics, the politician that you and I elect
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.200]   is the one who gets to write the checks to figure out who they want to pay back for putting them
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.280]   into office. Here's what's happened though. That's become increasingly meaningless.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:07.360]   I read a book last year by Tyler Cohen called The Complacent Class. And it was so interesting to me
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.760]   because he brought out some ideas that I hadn't really thought of previously. One of the ideas
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:18.880]   that he brought out in that book was he talked about how in the past, political debates mattered
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.760]   because so much more of government spending could be determined by an executive who's in charge.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:31.280]   And yet today, whatever executive is placed into the White House in the United States of America,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:39.760]   they have very little ability to actually make a difference. Because of the steady growth,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:48.480]   excuse me, Freudian slip, because of the steady growth of federal spending on entitlement programs
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:56.640]   and military spending and interest on a debt, the actual percentage of the budget that an executive
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.320]   could control has steadily decreased from, I didn't look up the numbers, forgive me, but
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:08.960]   majority of the budget to a tiny, tiny percentage. I have these numbers here from the
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:16.640]   Office of OMB, the Office of Management and Budget for 2015 of federal spending.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.560]   And here was what it was in 2015. Total federal spending at that point was $3.8 trillion.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   The largest percentage of federal spending is 33% or $1.28 trillion, which is – which is spent on
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:41.360]   Social Security, unemployment, and labor. 33% of the budget by Social Security. Social Security is
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.280]   an area of government spending that is not only bankrupt, has been bailed out multiple times,
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:53.440]   but faces a demographic crisis in the future because of fewer and fewer workers and the
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.040]   massive growth of new – more and more people retiring, the massive growth of the baby boomers.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.880]   Younger people, even though birth rates are higher in the United States than they are in
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.600]   many parts of the world, especially Europe, birth rates are too low and especially too
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.760]   low to support the large wave of the elderly. But that's 33% of the budget.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:22.480]   Now, next biggest category is Medicare and health, which is $1.05 trillion, 27.24 – sorry, 27.42%.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.800]   If you add that to the previous 33%, you come up with over 60% of the budget
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:38.560]   that's dedicated to Social Security and Medicare. One bit of kudos or at least President George W.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:45.360]   Bush tried to have a conversation about Social Security. It ended in total disaster. He wrote
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.120]   about it in his book, in his autobiography, The Hard Decisions. He wrote about how one of his
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.080]   biggest frustrations with presidency, one of his biggest regrets, was that he couldn't push the
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.800]   discussion further to talk about some kind of discussion of privatizing some form of Social
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:08.960]   Security. Did you in the recent political environment, have you heard any serious
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:16.640]   politician discuss any changes to Social Security or Medicare on the federal level?
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:23.920]   I haven't heard of one. Supposedly, the Republicans and the GOP was supposed to have
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.240]   some kind of fiscal conservatism. And yet from the very beginning, President Trump,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.400]   when he was then candidate Trump, always proclaimed that he had no intention of making
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.720]   any changes to entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare are discussed. That's 60%
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.560]   of the federal budget that no politician will talk about.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:53.840]   Next, of course, is military spending. In 2015, it was $609 billion. As you just read in the Stockman
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.520]   piece, we can expect that to continue increasing. That's 15.88%.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.440]   Well, let's just add that up. Now we're at 76%.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:10.720]   76% of the federal budget on Social Security, Medicare, and military spending.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:18.240]   I thought Stockman did a pretty good job of showing how disgusting the military spending of
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.160]   the United States of America is. The US military can't seem to win a war, hasn't won a war since
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.720]   World War II. And yet we keep on sending money constantly, telling them, "Well, you can't seem
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.280]   to win a war since the end of World War II, so we'll just send you more money to spread all
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.360]   around the globe and tell everyone what to do." It's disgusting. Now let's add one more.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:53.680]   Interest on the debt in 2015, $229 billion or 5.97%. Add that up, we're now at 82.5% of the
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:07.440]   federal budget for the year 2015. 82.5%. And yet when's the last time you heard an honest
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.680]   political debate among political opponents who were actually dealing with a single bit
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.960]   of the 82.5%? You don't hear it.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:29.760]   But what gets worse and worse and worse is all the political infighting. And everybody thinks
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.040]   the wrong thing about the other person. Now here's what's amazing. When you actually start digging
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.160]   into the numbers, what you find is that the people who sell themselves as conservatives,
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.760]   especially fiscal conservatives, are actually the worst of the lot.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:48.320]   You know who spent the most money in the last rash of presidents?
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:57.040]   Reagan and Bushes. You know who's the most conservative fiscally? Who do you think
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.440]   in the recent past few decades of political history, who was the most fiscally conservative
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:13.760]   president of the past few decades? The answer, surprisingly, President Obama.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.600]   I say surprisingly for many people, because although he never really championed himself
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:27.280]   as a budget hawk, in actuality, that's what happened. And there's this whole raft of
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.960]   conservative political ideology that says, "Oh, President Obama is going to spend this into
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.040]   oblivion." He wound up being extremely conservative in terms of fiscally. Now we can argue about the
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.880]   causes, because that certainly wasn't his goal. He never proclaimed that as, "This is my number
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.480]   one goal." But let me read you just an article here by an author named Dan Mitchell. This is
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.320]   interesting. Mirror, mirror on the wall, Obama definitely was not the biggest spender of all
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.720]   from October 16, 2017. "I've learned that it's more important to pay attention to hard numbers
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.120]   rather than political rhetoric. Republicans, for instance, love to beat their chests about
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.000]   spending restraint, but I never believe them without first checking the numbers. Likewise,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.120]   Democrats have a reputation as big spenders, but we occasionally get some surprising results when
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.800]   they're in charge." President Obama was especially hard to categorize. Republicans automatically
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.840]   assumed he was profligate because he started his tenure with a Keynesian spending binge and the
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.200]   Obamacare entitlement. But after a few years in office, some were arguing he was the most frugal
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.320]   president of our modern times. So I crunched the data in 2012 and discovered that he was either a
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.920]   big spender or a closet Reaganite, depending on how the numbers were sliced. I then recalculated
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:43.440]   the budget numbers in 2013 and found that spending grew at a slower rate the longer Obama was in
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.680]   office. And when I did the same exercise in 2014 using another year of data, Obama looked even more
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:56.000]   like a tight-fisted fiscal conservative. Or to be more accurate, what I basically discovered is that
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.160]   debt limit fights, sequestration, and government shutdowns were actually very effective. Indeed,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.400]   the United States enjoyed a de facto spending freeze between 2009 and 2014, leading to the
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.960]   biggest five-year reduction in the burden of federal spending since the end of World War II.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.480]   And it's unclear that Obama deserves any of the credit since he was on the wrong side of those
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.600]   battles. Anyhow, I've decided to update the numbers now that we have eight years of data for
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.640]   Obama's two terms. First, a brief digression on methodology. All the numbers you're about to see
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.280]   have been adjusted for inflation, so these are apples-to-apples comparisons. Moreover, all my
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.240]   calculations are designed to show average annual increases. I also made sure that the stimulus
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.760]   spending that took place in the 2009 fiscal year was included in Obama's totals, even though that
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.600]   fiscal year began on October 1, 2008, while Bush was president. We'll start with a look at total
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:54.560]   outlays. On this basis, Obama is actually the most conservative president since World War II,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:02.640]   and Bill Clinton is in second place. Obama, total outlays, 0.8%. Clinton, 1.5%. Bush, 1, 1.8%.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:11.760]   Reagan, 2.6%. Nixon, 3.3%. Carter, 4.0%. Bush, 2, 5.1%. And LBJ, 5.9%. But total outlays doesn't
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.400]   really capture a president's track record because interest payments are included, which effectively
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.520]   means they get blamed for all the debt run up by their predecessors. So if we remove payments for
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.800]   net interest, we get a measure of what is called primary spending, total outlays minus net interest.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.280]   As you can see, Obama is still in first place, and Reagan jumps up to second place.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   Primary spending, Obama, 0.7%. Reagan, 1.9%. Clinton, 1.9%. Bush, 1, 2%. Carter, 3.2%.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:50.080]   Nixon, 3.3%. Bush, 2, 6%. LBJ, 6%. I would argue that one other major adjustment is needed to make
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.960]   the numbers more accurate. There have been two major financial bailouts in the past 30 years,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.440]   the savings and loan bailout in the late 1980s and the TARP bailout at the end of last decade.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.080]   Those bailouts created big one-time expenses followed by an influx of money from asset sales
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.520]   and repaid loans that actually gets counted as a negative spending. Those bailouts added a big
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.240]   chunk of one-time spending at the end of the Reagan years and at the end of the George W. Bush years,
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.040]   while then producing negative outlays during the early years of George H. W. Bush administration
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.400]   and Obama administration. So if we take out the one-time effects of those two bailouts,
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.160]   which I categorize as non-TARP for reasons of brevity, we get a new ranking. Reagan is now in
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   first place, followed by Clinton and Obama. Primary spending, non-TARP. Reagan, 1.6%. Clinton,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:52.080]   1.7%. Obama, 2.1%. Nixon, 2.8%. Carter, 3%. Bush, 1, 3.2%. Bush, 2, 4.6%. LBJ, 6%.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.840]   By the way, Lyndon Johnson has been in last place regardless of how the numbers are calculated,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.160]   and George W. Bush has had the second worst numbers. For all intents and purposes,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.600]   the above numbers are how a libertarian would rank the various presidents,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.680]   since both domestic spending and military spending are part of the calculations.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.320]   So let's look closely at how a conservative would rank the presidents, which is a simple exercise
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.640]   because all that's required is to remove military spending. Here are the numbers,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.680]   showing the average inflation-adjusted increase in overall domestic outlays for various presidents.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:29.200]   Still excluding the one-time bailouts, of course. By this measure, Reagan easily is in first place,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.520]   though it's worth noting that three Democrats occupy the next positions,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.840]   though Obama's numbers are no longer impressive while Republicans along with LBJ get the worst
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:47.280]   scores. Domestic spending, non-TARP. Reagan, 0.6%. Clinton, 2.5%. Carter, 2.8%. Obama, 3.3%.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:56.160]   Bush, 2.0%. Bush, 3.9%. Bush, 1.0%. LBJ, 6.5%. Nixon, 8.4%. The bottom line is that Reaganomics
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.880]   was a comparative success, but should we also conclude that Obama was a fiscal conservative?
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.560]   I don't think he deserves credit, but I won't add anything to what I wrote above.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.120]   Instead, I'll simply note that Brian Riedel of the Manhattan Institute has a good analysis of
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.280]   Obama's fiscal record. Here is his conclusion. "It is important to recognize that Obama did not
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:21.440]   stop trying to expand government after 2010. The president's eight annual budget requests
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:28.720]   gradually upped their 10-year revenue demands from $1.3 trillion to $3.4 trillion, while proposing
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:35.920]   an average of $1.0 trillion in new program spending over the next decade. His play, in short, was to
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.320]   gradually trim the budget deficit by chasing large spending increases with even larger tax increases.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.440]   The Republican Congress stopped him. My assessment? Obama's most important fiscal
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.560]   legacy was a sin of omission. Despite promising to confront Social Security and Medicare's
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.200]   unsustainable deficits, the president refused to endorse any plan that would come close to
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.640]   achieving solvency. This surrendered eight crucial years of baby boomer retirements,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.600]   while costs accelerated. With baby boomers retiring and a national debt projected to
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.920]   exceed $90 trillion within 30 years, this was no small surrender. In other words, the relatively
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.560]   good short-run numbers were in spite of Obama, and the long-run numbers were bad and still are bad
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.680]   because he chose to let the entitlement problem fester. But he was still better,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:32.480]   meaning less worse, than Bush 1, Bush 2, and Nixon." End of article by Dan Mitchell.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.720]   Now, I read those two articles in their entirety to you, at the risk of losing
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:46.400]   many listeners through them, to demonstrate to you the problem.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:59.920]   And the problem is that now there seems to be no check, not even a debate. That to me is not
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.120]   obviously the problem, but a major problem. That to me is the most concerning thing about last week,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:12.240]   the night of fiscal infamy, as David Stockman referred to it. When you have Republicans
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:18.560]   with the authority and the power and the political power to line up and pass gargantuan tax cuts,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.720]   and then you have Republicans willing to line up with Democrats
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.800]   and pass gargantuan spending increases, we have a major problem.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:39.600]   I thought the Babylon Bee article, Babylon Bee, of course, a popular satire site. I thought the
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   Babylon Bee article summed it up nicely. This is about an accurate news article. It's a shame it
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.920]   has to come from a satire site. Here was the headline, "Republicans Announce Plan to Pretend
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.960]   to Be Fiscally Conservative Again the Moment a Democrat Takes Office." Washington, D.C.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.200]   During a budgetary discussion Friday, Republican lawmakers announced a plan to pretend to be
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.520]   fiscally conservative again if a Democrat takes office again in 2020 or 2024. The GOP said it
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.720]   would begin to decry deficit spending and the $20 trillion debt in order to win votes as soon as
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.160]   political power swung back to the opposing party. "The second a Democrat is back in the White House,
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.880]   we will once again start yelling about fiscal responsibility," Speaker Paul Ryan said in an
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.240]   address to the House of Representatives Friday. "For now, we will continue to vote for unsustainable
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.720]   and irresponsible budgets that your children's children's children will pay for for centuries
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.440]   to come." At publishing time, Republicans further announced they would pretend to oppose giving
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.760]   Planned Parenthood a half billion dollars year after year once they need conservative voters'
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:49.600]   support to regain their offices. End of Babylon Bee article. Go on. Satire. That's a pretty
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:57.040]   accurate summary though. So what can you do? What can you actually do? Because I don't want
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:06.480]   to just be black and angry today on... I can hear a friend of mine's voice ringing in my ear about
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:13.520]   my black joke, unintentional black joke. I don't want to be black in mood and angry in today's show.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:22.960]   I want to talk about some solutions. And here are some potential solutions.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:32.000]   And as I get to them, I want to give you just a tiny bit of insight. I probably have a different
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.040]   perspective on some of these things based upon some experiences that I have that are not the
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:48.320]   norm in the United States of America. I, in many ways, do reflect common US American culture.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:55.520]   I have been part of common US American culture, but I've been fortunate to have a bit more of
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:01.920]   an international perspective than perhaps some other people, especially more than many other
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:10.320]   US Americans who tend to be culturally more insular and inward focused than global in focus
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:16.640]   or global in experience. I can't claim much credit for it. A lot of that just comes from
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:22.960]   how I was raised and who I was raised by. My parents, when they were... Long before I was born,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.120]   my parents worked as international missionaries broadcasting Christian radio programs behind the
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:35.040]   bamboo curtain into communist China. And in their work living in Asia, in their work, they would
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.960]   frequently host people in their home who were enemies of the state, smuggling Bibles into China
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:46.720]   at the risk of their life. This was a normal thing. And so growing up, they knew many of those
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:54.080]   people. They've seen the impact of oppression and totalitarianism. That kind of was normal.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:00.880]   I have today experiences from around the world that are very current, that are a little bit
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:08.720]   different than I think many people. For example, I'm involved with some people in an African
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:14.560]   country and recently... It was in Kenya. Recently, there was a very contested political
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:25.920]   election in Kenya such that this particular place, they had an overnight increase in local
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:32.080]   food prices of five times. I want you to think for a moment, what would happen if due to political
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:39.600]   unrest and political instability, your food prices in your local supermarket increased by five times?
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:48.080]   If you spend $500 a month, you immediately have to spend $2,500 a month to feed your family.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.600]   But let's make it worse because if you're spending $500 a month to feed your family,
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.320]   there's quite a room for luxury in there. Let's say that you've already cut your food bill
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:04.320]   to the absolute bare subsistence, which is how they live, living on a little bit of rice,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.400]   a little bit of porridge, a little bit of grain, and about a gram of meat here or there as it can
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:16.160]   be spared, and now make a 5x increase in food prices. That was this year with friends of mine
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.360]   in Kenya. With the political violence and the political unrest with friends of mine in Kenya,
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:28.400]   there were hundreds, hundreds of people who had their homes burned for no other reason than they
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:37.840]   happened to be from the wrong, so-called the wrong tribe. I have one friend of mine who wound up with
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:47.440]   over 300 people living in his home. And no, that's not an overstatement. He had a large home,
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.920]   but they put 300 people, stacked them in the barn, stacked them in the yard. But all of these
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.720]   were people who had fled their homes due to political persecution in Kenya. This is in the
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.960]   past few months. This is today. This is current. Now, it is in Kenya, but that's today. That's not
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.320]   ancient history. That's a real situation. He still has over 100 people living with him due to
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:16.000]   political violence. They've been rebuilding the houses, systematically trying to get people over.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.480]   But it's not just the loss of property, it's the loss of life. One of the men had gone back to the
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.880]   village where they lived to find out if it was safe to return and was killed by the political
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.960]   opposition because he was there. That's today. That's the past few months. That's a situation
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:39.440]   that I'm actively involved in. I have other friends who live in other places in Africa.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:47.600]   It's not just Africa. I have a friend of mine from Venezuela. Talk about a nightmare. When I
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.040]   was in college, I had a bunch of lefty socialist college professors who held up Venezuela as the
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:03.280]   paragon of socialist success. Well, fast forward 10 years and none of them have yet recanted of
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.160]   they're trying to teach me that Venezuela was the way the government should be run.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:16.080]   As the country implodes, the country implodes, the hospitals are broken,
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.480]   there's no food available, people are robbing trucks on the streets
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.880]   just to try to get a little bit of food, the exits are clogged. The Venezuelan government says,
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:35.920]   "Oh, we can't print passports because we ran out of paper and ink." Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. So you've
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.600]   got massive lines of people trying to get out of the country, but the Venezuelan government says,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.360]   "We can't print passports." Well, here's one for you. You think it's all Venezuela?
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:55.600]   US IRS this month will now begin enforcing a new law that was passed a year... No,
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:03.120]   by end of 2015, a couple of years ago, a new law where if you owe the IRS large amounts of
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:12.160]   delinquent debt, over $50,000, the IRS will begin denying passports to you.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.680]   So look how the government people do it. They say, "Well, we're going to put up borders. We're
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.840]   going to build a wall, right? Because we got to keep the bad people out." Yeah. So there's a
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.960]   giant wall that goes up, and now you've surrendered your right of free travel to a government that
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:35.200]   stands up and says, "We're going to keep all the bad people out." And now the exact same government
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:41.360]   to whom you every year by law are required to disclose all of your financial transactions,
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:47.120]   to disclose every dollar of income that comes into your hands, to disclose every single person
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.960]   that you gave money to, this exact same entity that requires you to disclose where your money is.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.920]   After all, got to have that report on how much money is in your IRA and what it's invested in,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.920]   and I got to make sure that every person that you do business with sends in a paper to the IRS.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.840]   That exact same IRS that pays a whistleblower a percentage of the taxes if you cheat on your
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.640]   taxes and then somebody rats you out to the IRS, they're entitled to a percentage of the
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:22.160]   collections from you. That exact same IRS that has been proven to use their power for political
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:34.080]   targeting, proven. Before the 2012 election, senior IRS executives, most notably Lois Lerner,
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.680]   the head of the IRS department that oversees the activities of tax-exempt groups, starts singling
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   out conservative-leaning organizations for extra attention, investigations, and harassment.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.200]   Not because they thought they were violating the rules,
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   but because they had words like Tea Party or Patriot in their name. And then, of course,
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   instead of actually exposing it, Lois Lerner stages an event at a tax law conference,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:15.040]   uses a planted questioner in the audience in order to allow her to disclose the issue on her terms.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:21.120]   And, of course, all of the emails disappear and walks free. And the worst thing about it,
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   nobody cares. All of the liberals and the Democrats that said, "Oh, it's just the
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.240]   conservative people. After all, they're nasty racists anyway." Well, how does it feel when
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:42.000]   President Trump has control of the IRS? Kind of stinks when there's a switch of political power,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.480]   doesn't it? Now, I'm not aware of any allegations of us having done that, but, of course,
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.680]   I doubt it would surprise any of us to hear such allegations. The point is that that exact same IRS
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:46:01.840]   today, if you owe them over $50,000, will deny your passport application and disallow you from
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:08.960]   leaving the country. And you voted for it. You voted for it because you wanted a government
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   official standing at the border saying, "Papers, please." Friend, we deserve what we got.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.120]   We deserve what we're going to get. Now, I told you this was not going to be a fun show,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.920]   but we deserve it. Now, you look for solutions. I don't know of a single solution
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:42.560]   on a political space. I don't see it. If we go through almost every single area of society,
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:48.720]   I can find...this is just the tip of the iceberg in problems, and I see no political solutions.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:56.640]   You say, "Financial solution?" Uh-huh. Show me. Show me the financial solution. Show me
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:02.960]   the serious proposal by a serious economist. I don't even care if they are full-throated
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:12.560]   Keynesians. Just show me a serious proposal of anybody who thinks that we could ever even stop
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:22.880]   running a deficit. It's all games, and the day of reckoning will come. Now, when will it come?
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:29.680]   I don't know. How long can we keep pushing this snowball downhill? I don't know. A decade? A
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:38.960]   couple of decades? I have no idea. But I do know this. I used to listen to people who would make
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.080]   dire warnings about the future on different political issues, different fiscal issues,
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:50.480]   and I used to think, "Nah, they're overstating things." That's a little bit excessive. It's
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:57.360]   probably not so bad. I don't like to be a dire extremist. It's not very fun to be an extremist
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:06.640]   in today's world. I don't particularly like that reputation. But in hindsight, when you actually go
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:14.000]   back and you look and you say, "Wait a second. Were they right?" You know what you find?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.280]   They were right, but they were too optimistic.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:26.320]   Things can change faster than you ever believed.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:34.720]   So what do you do? Well, here are just 10 practical things that are the best I can come up with
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:45.040]   that I think are actually useful. Number one, build yourself into a stronger person.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:53.280]   And I mean that in the fullest sense of the world. You can't predict what happens out there,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:04.880]   but you can influence how strong you are to deal with what happens out there.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:16.960]   If I'm completely wrong and I'm indulging my paranoia, my catastrophism in today's commentary,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   you'll still be better off if you focus on building yourself into a stronger person.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:29.520]   Now, when I say stronger, I mean stronger in every sense of the word.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.600]   Make yourself physically stronger. I always love the quote from Mark Ripetoe,
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.160]   he always says, "Strong people are harder to kill." It's true. Strong people are harder to kill.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.240]   So make yourself as strong as you're able with your physical strength, with your physical health.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:52.640]   Make your body as strong and as competent as possible. Make yourself mentally strong.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.920]   Challenge your ideas, challenge your positions, challenge your arguments, develop the skill and
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:06.640]   the practice and the habit of challenging yourself and defending your ideas. Develop your personal
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   virtues, your self-discipline, your integrity, your work ethic. Whatever being a strong person
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:23.600]   means to you, do it. Develop psychological strength, spiritual strength, every bit of
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.840]   strength that you can come up with, but build yourself into a stronger person. Because here's
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.000]   where I was going when I was trying to give some of those examples of scenarios that I've been
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.360]   involved in. The strong survive no matter how terrible the circumstances are. I have a friend
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:47.680]   of mine who had a business in the Southern Philippines. This friend built a cell phone
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:55.120]   tower. It was a good business. So established some agreements to bring in broadband and digital
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.480]   service to the place, borrowed money, built a cell phone tower. There was good demand. It was
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:07.680]   a good business. And then there was a massacre by some of the Islamic terrorists there in the
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.120]   Southern Philippines in the town. I think over 40 to 50 people were killed, and it almost
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:20.160]   instantaneously destroyed the island, destroyed the economy. My friend lost his tower, lost his
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.520]   business, and wound up fleeing with his family in fear of his life. Had to buy protection from
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:31.120]   the leader of the Islamic terrorist organization to allow him and his family passage out of the
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:38.560]   area. It was a nightmare. But you know what? He's still alive, and he's still kicking,
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:45.280]   and he can rebuild. In all of the circumstances that I kept describing, my friend from Venezuela,
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.560]   a friend from Kenya, all of these people, they're still able to work. They're still there.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:56.880]   Because in every war zone, in every place of catastrophe, you still are going to wind up
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:05.680]   with people. And the strong survive. The strong work at it. So build yourself into a strong person.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:13.040]   Focus on it. I'm preaching to myself. I need to be continually focusing on building myself
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.720]   into a strong person. Because the circumstances that you and I face in the coming decades
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:26.480]   will be just like circumstances that other people have faced in past decades. But in the hard times,
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.960]   there are opportunities if you're prepared for them. That's number one. Build a strong person.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:37.760]   Number two, build a strong family. Build a strong family.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:47.120]   When structures of support fall apart, we all fall back on family. Now, this is actually one
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:55.520]   of the major indications of catastrophe in modern culture. Because families have become increasingly
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:02.640]   weakened and splintered, people place more of their hopes and their needs on government.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.000]   But government cannot bring people together. The most that government can do is ensure
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.720]   justice for victims and ensure liberty. That's about it.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:21.360]   I feel like I have almost nothing in common with many other US Americans.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.040]   People want to get me all wrapped up in nationalism and American patriotism. I have
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.360]   more in common with my friend from Venezuela than I do with my next door neighbor. I have more in
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:41.920]   common with my friend from Kenya than I do with the person across town who just sees the world in
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:48.880]   a radically different way than me. And so this is one of the reasons for the increasing pressure
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:54.800]   being placed on political systems. As families and local communities disintegrate, there's more
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.120]   and more pressure on the political system to solve it. Well, when the political system
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:04.480]   falls apart, when the federal government cracks up and goes bankrupt,
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.240]   you're going to fall back on family whether you like it or not.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.920]   We always do. So how strong is your family?
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.160]   When your mom and your dad's Social Security checks stop coming in,
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:25.600]   they're coming to live with you. So how strong is your family relationship with them?
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:33.680]   When your Social Security checks start bouncing and the Medicare doctor will no longer see you
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:39.040]   and you can't be physically strong enough to stand in the lines to see the one or two who will,
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:46.000]   you're going to move in with your children. How strong is your family?
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:55.920]   If you build a strong family, then you have a support network. You can support one another.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.800]   Where are you going to go when your business goes belly up and you need money?
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:09.360]   You need to go to family. So don't worry about politics. Build your strong family.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:17.040]   Number three, build a strong local community with people who live near you.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:25.440]   Physical, in-person communities. You and I can't affect people in a state on the other side of the
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:31.200]   country, but we can talk to our neighbors and we can affect our neighbors. We can engage with our
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:38.560]   neighbors. We can encourage our neighbors. One of the most worrying trends has been the total
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:45.280]   collapse in the United States of the formerly strong local civic organizations. You go read
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   Robert Putnam's book, Bowling Alone, and he just lays it out. And that's a decade old,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:56.080]   more than a decade ago that he wrote that book. Now, there are other things that have taken the
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:03.200]   place of that to some degree, but build a strong community, a strong local community.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:10.960]   Now, those three things are a lifetime's work. Building a strong you, building a strong family,
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.240]   and building a strong local community, those are lifetime endeavors.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:21.200]   But the stronger those things are, the better and the more support you'll have.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:28.000]   Number four, build a strong financial position in your personal finances.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.960]   In short, work to have lots of money and no debt.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:40.480]   The stronger you are, the more easily you can weather storms.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   Listen again, I am not predicting stock market collapses. I don't have a clue what the stock
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:56.160]   market's going to do. The ability for companies to engage in markets all around the world and to
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:03.840]   sell products is powerful. That economic enterprise results in profit. That profit is the result of
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:08.480]   thousands and thousands of people working together to create products that people want.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.720]   I am not predicting that because the US federal government can't get its act together,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   that all of a sudden Coca-Cola is going to stop selling Coke.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:27.920]   What I am predicting is that disruption in society will continue to get worse and worse.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.080]   And the stronger your personal financial position, the better.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:37.680]   Set a goal of having lots of money and no debt.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:45.120]   "So Joshua, that's simple." Yeah, it's simple. But set a goal of having lots of money and no debt.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:51.760]   And the stronger your personal financial position is, the easier life storms will be on you.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:58.880]   If you're broke and deeply in debt and you get a flat tire on your car, it can be a catastrophe.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:06.080]   There are many people for whom that flat tire would put them out on the street because they
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   missed their rent payment, they get evicted from their apartment, and now they're out on the street
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.720]   and they can't figure out how to rebuild things. But if you have money and no debt, then now your
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:22.880]   personal tire need is no longer a catastrophe.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.760]   So four, build a strong financial position in your personal finances.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:34.080]   Number five, build a strong performance in your job. Your income is the single most
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:38.640]   important thing that will keep you going through times of economic hardship,
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:48.000]   through times of economic calamity, through recession. Your income is vital.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.800]   As long as you can sustain your income, you can weather through.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:59.280]   If you have income, you can make different choices. You can cut your cable, you can make
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   different choices and buy cheap food instead of fancy food, as long as you have income.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:09.680]   If your income disappears, you've got problems. So your income is the most important thing for
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   you to focus on to keep you going through economic calamity. So you're going to need to build
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:21.360]   a strong reputation for performance at your job. Being a valuable worker,
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:27.600]   valuable to the company, making a difference on the job is crucial.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:35.280]   While you're doing it, build a strong network to help you easily transition to another job,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.320]   a new job if you need one. A strong network will help you in your job and it will help you get a
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:48.160]   new job when you lose yours. This may be a good time for you to go back and listen to
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:59.360]   episodes 192, 193, and 194 of Radical Personal Finance. That is a trio of shows dedicated to
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:05.760]   this topic. 192 is called Recession is Coming, How to Not Get Laid Off in the Next Recession.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:12.640]   Guess what, friend, as I record this in February of 2018, recession is coming.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:18.800]   You don't want to get laid off in the next recession. Recession always comes.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:26.160]   Recession is coming. You don't want to get laid off. So listen to episode 192. Number 193 is
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.720]   called Make a Backup Plan in Case You Get Laid Off in the Coming Recession, Simple Action Steps
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.960]   for You to Consider. Those are things that you could do today. And then 194 is You Just Got
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:43.680]   Laid Off, Here's What to Do Next. My show dedicated to as a resource for somebody who just got laid
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:50.960]   off to say, okay, here's what I need to do next. Build strong performance in your job and a strong
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:58.320]   network to help you transition to a new job if you need to. Number five, build a strong business
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.640]   if you own a business or consider building a sideline business or at least have ideas
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.720]   about alternative sources of income. In your business, look at it and ask yourself this
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.760]   question. What would happen during hard fiscal times in the United States? What happens to my
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:25.840]   business during recession? Can I strengthen my business? Most businesses can press forward
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:35.600]   regardless of what happens in the government world. But some businesses can't. So if you're
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.200]   reliant on government spending for your business, make sure that you're building up a business that
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:50.560]   can continue to grow or at least you have an exit plan. Next, six, seven, build a strong portfolio.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:02:03.840]   Protect your investments. You say how? I don't know how you can do it, but ask yourself how you
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:13.600]   would do it given your investment constraints. My answer usually revolves around understanding
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:23.200]   your personal financial goals and starting with your personal finances. You can weather a 20%
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.440]   decline in the stock market pretty well if you're living where you want to live, you have minimal
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.760]   and no debt, you have money in the bank, and you have a job that pays you well. In that situation,
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:41.120]   your investment account balance is not the most important thing for you.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:48.640]   It's a little harder to weather that same 20% decline when you are deep in debt,
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.840]   trying to figure out how to move your family across the country to switch to a better job,
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.840]   and you're out of money and have nothing around with which to work.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.200]   So my answer is usually investment, sorry, personal finance planning.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:13.600]   Out of debt, low expenses, high income, emergency fund. Then let your investment plans run.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:20.400]   Now within the context of an investment plan, build a strong portfolio. Understand the
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.160]   diversification in your portfolio, understand the risks in your portfolio, and build a portfolio
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   that will help you to sleep comfortably at night. If appropriate in your investment plan,
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:41.120]   protect your investments. Protect them with insurance strategies, whether that's physical
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.080]   insurance policies to protect something like a physical investment, whether that's insurance
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.480]   strategies in terms of a trading strategy, protect your investments.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:58.400]   Number eight, build a strong escape plan. You always need to be able to get out
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:09.920]   if you can, if you want to. I consider that this IRS recent, the integration this month of these
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:18.960]   new IRS guidelines, one of the most appalling breaches of trust, because it starts to place
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:27.920]   constrictions on somebody's movement. I am so sensitive to government interaction, because
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.760]   government is always used as a tool of violence for those who want to exert violence on somebody
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:42.960]   else. It always winds up in whoever is popular and powerful at the time being able to take
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:49.440]   advantage of the person who's weak. Don't allow yourself to get in the position of
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.520]   weakness if you can avoid it at all. For example, for a long time, one of the
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.080]   worst things about if you're behind on child support payments, many of the family courts
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.600]   have become weaponized against so many people, especially men. If you wind up and you put
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.760]   yourself in a situation where you're behind on your child support payments for the court,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.680]   now your passport has been restricted. That's not new. That's been the way it's been. The
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.080]   amounts of that, I think if memory is right, are pretty small. I think it's something like $2,500.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:21.360]   If you're in arrears on child support, you've got a problem. Make sure that you're putting
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:27.360]   yourself in a situation where you don't get there. Build an escape plan. If you need to get out of
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:34.160]   the inner city where you live, make a plan and get out. If you need to get out of an unsafe state or
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.680]   an unsafe region, make a plan and get out. If you need to get out of a bad country,
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.480]   make a plan and get out. Build a strong escape plan so you can move fast.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:53.200]   Open a newspaper, get online, study Venezuela. I do not think the United States of America
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:59.360]   would ever look like Venezuela. I don't. Venezuela is very different. But I think it's important to
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:08.320]   study real life, current scenarios like Venezuela and learn the lessons. The International Monetary
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:17.440]   Fund is predicting a 13,000% inflation rate in Venezuela this year. Yes, you heard that right.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:29.680]   I repeat, the International Monetary Fund is predicting a 13,000% inflation rate in Venezuela
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:42.720]   this year. That's today. That's not the Weimar Republic. That's not Zimbabwe. That's Venezuela,
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:53.520]   a modern economy sitting on untold wealth as measured in natural resources
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:07:00.800]   with a rich and proud cultural heritage. A decade ago,
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.000]   I was sitting in a college classroom in Central America,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.280]   listening to college professors expound the virtues of Venezuela and Hugo Chavez.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:21.840]   Today, a decade later, the International Monetary Fund predicts a 13,000% inflation rate in Venezuela
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:28.320]   this year. The refugees are lined up at the border of Colombia, desperate to get out.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.480]   You always need to be able to get out. So build an escape plan. If you don't have a passport now,
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   get one. If you don't have an idea on where to go, make one up. Build an escape plan,
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:50.720]   because the easiest way to get around most problems is just leave.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:58.160]   Number nine, build a strong homestead, a strong home base.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:04.320]   One of the major tragedies of the modern era is that the government has been
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:12.080]   trying to disconnect the financial system from real wealth, the real things that you need.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:20.800]   And our houses and our land is a net consumer of financial means rather than a provider.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.440]   Our houses sit empty. We heat them and cool them all day long while we're not there,
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.120]   or we drive in a car to go and work at a job that we don't like that's 50 miles away from
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:37.840]   where we live. What's the point? Build a strong homestead, a place where you want to be.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.640]   Build a house that you want to be in. Make your house provide for you, not just to keep the rain
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.280]   off, but also make your house provide your energy for you. Make your house beautiful. Make it a
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:55.200]   house filled with love. Make it a house that cools you, that feeds you. Put a flock of chickens in
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.920]   your backyard. Put a dairy goat in your backyard if you want one. Raise some fish so that you can
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.120]   eat protein. Plant a garden with your children so they can get good microbes in their skin.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.280]   It's proven to improve their health. Build a place that you want to be.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:16.560]   Pay the house off so that it's a stable place to live. Back it up with money in the bank and a
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.440]   fruit tree out front so that you can build a stable life. Your property should provide for you.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:28.320]   Number 10, build a strong plan for the future. Future is incredibly bright.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.720]   What happens is when you're in the middle of crises, or you're in the middle of what looks
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.560]   like a crisis, as I sketched out with discussion of fiscal stupidity,
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:46.080]   when you're in the middle of a crisis, it's easy to forget that the dawn is coming.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.560]   But if you look back over the arc of history, what you see is that through every crisis comes
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:10:01.520]   opportunity. The future is bright. Every single year, the world gets better and better and better.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:11.840]   And ultimately, when the United States of America implodes, just like all of the other
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.920]   empires before us have imploded, whether that's slow and painful or whether that's quick and
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:29.600]   fast, same thing, whether it's slow or fast, something else will replace it. And by being
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:37.920]   strong yourself, by building a strong family that supports you and that you support others,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:44.720]   by being engaged in a strong local community, by building a strong financial position in your
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:51.600]   personal finances, by having strong job prospects or a strong business, by having a well-built,
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.120]   strong portfolio, by having that strong escape plan to fall back on if you ever need it,
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.320]   and by having that strong home base to work from and to build from,
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   then I'm convinced you may have the opportunity to be one of those who builds the next thing.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.320]   If you go and you study the life cycle of many companies that wind up bankrupt and in ashes,
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:22.080]   it's not unusual to find an employee or a handful of employees that come out of that company
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:29.120]   and get together and say, "Now that we're unburdened from the wreckage that was the
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.280]   previous company, now that we're unburdened from the debt, now that we're unburdened from
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:42.320]   the corporate regulations, let's build something new and better." My hope is that you can be part
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:49.840]   of that that's new and better, and me too. That's my best summary of the ideas that I have to
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:56.560]   improve things for the future. Don't try to convince me from here on out that politics has
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:02.640]   any hope of making a difference. I haven't really thought politics had much of a difference,
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.120]   made much of a difference for the last decade. I mean, man, national politics. I hadn't really
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.320]   thought it made much of a difference, but just watching last week with the Republicans and the
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:19.280]   Democrats and the boondoggles of the last couple of weeks convinces me beyond measure that politics
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:29.760]   has no hope. The hypocrisy from the politicians is so thick. It's insane. It is insane.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:42.080]   How any normal, reasonable person can think that all...can think that those people just don't just
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.880]   lie through their teeth. But whatever sounds politically expedient is beyond me. Maybe there
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.920]   were a few handfuls. Kudos to Rand Paul for standing up and speaking on the record. I think
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:59.040]   his speech, I went and watched some of his speech. It should be required listening in my mind for
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.280]   most citizens before voting. I'd love to see that happen, but whatever.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:14.960]   I just can't buy it. I'm not really sure how to end this show. I don't have a powerful,
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:23.920]   punchy ending. I don't have any strong closing story or call to action. I just want you to be
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:38.640]   strong. I hope this is not too dark. I don't want to compare the severity of these things.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.360]   But the only example that comes to me as I think about when it comes to political stuff,
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   I wonder about the inevitability of things. Because I think the future is not decreed in the
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:05.120]   sense that it's unchangeable. The future is open. It can be changed. I think sometimes,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:11.440]   I don't know if you're familiar with the Rumbula massacre during World War II. It was one of the
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:18.240]   worst massacres of World War II, massacres of Jews by the Nazis, where they killed about 25,000
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:31.760]   Jews. It happened near Riga, Latvia. It was huge and in an evil way. But basically, the way that
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:40.800]   the events worked out is the Nazis decided that they wanted to clear out the ghettos in Riga.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.640]   They came in and they made big plans. They had the people dig these big pits. It was so evil.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:54.720]   They brought in some people who had been really skilled in giant massacres of people previously.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:01.120]   They brought out bulldozers and they dug these giant holes in the ground. They had to
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.400]   dig them with ramps so that it would be efficient to load the people down into.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:13.040]   Then they swooped through the ghetto and they started grabbing all the people off the street.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.000]   They actually marched them 10 kilometers, something like 10 kilometers out of the city
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.160]   to the planned murder location. While they were marching them there, they had guards along the
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.080]   road. Then they had this whole system set up. They took the people and they marched them to a place.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.440]   They told them to take their clothes off. They took all their clothes off, made stacks of them.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.280]   Then they marched them naked right down into the pits and then they started shooting them.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.800]   They did it very systematically down in levels where they would make force the people down into
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:50.480]   the pits and make them lie on the people below them in the pits who had just been shot. Then
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.840]   the guards lined up and shot them in the back of the head. They killed 25,000 people in one day.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:07.040]   What's the point? The point is that you always wonder, is there a point along the way which if
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   people just simply moved and fought back that they could stop the madness, stop the evil?
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.560]   It's hard to believe there's not.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.960]   If you think about thousands of people being marched 10 kilometers, you can never get enough
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.960]   guards with guns to keep that many people
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:46.480]   hostage unless the people themselves are not strong enough to fight back.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:58.160]   Now, at the fear of using a horrific comparison, and in no way am I comparing fiscal insanity
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:07.280]   to the Holocaust, but in a way, I often think about that. People just standing there digging
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.880]   their own graves. There are many accounts of Jews being forced to dig their own graves right before
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.000]   they're shot. You wonder, at what point in time when somebody's digging their grave, do they not
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:23.120]   just turn around and say, "No, I'm not going to do it"? On all of this political stuff, it's like
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.440]   the culture of the United States is being ripped apart. You just wonder, at what point in time are
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:40.160]   people going to stop and say, "This isn't working. The violence doesn't work." I don't know. I don't
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:47.520]   know if it's possible. I hope it is. But I do know that if you're strong, if you're a strong person,
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.000]   strong family, you're part of a strong community, you're in a strong financial position, you have a
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.480]   strong performance in your job, strong business, strong portfolio, strong homestead, strong escape
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:04.880]   plan, then perhaps you could be one of those who could either fight your way off of that road
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:13.040]   while everyone's marching to their death and you slip away, or perhaps you can be one of those who
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:24.080]   organizes the victims to stand up and say, "No, we're not going to take this." But if you're broke,
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:32.400]   you're a weak person, your family is torn apart, you're not part of a local community,
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:40.720]   you're broken in debt, you're struggling at your work, it's not going to work. You can't be part
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.040]   of the solution. So don't worry about politics. Don't worry about the federal government. I don't
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:52.560]   think much of anything is going to change this year. But work to become a stronger person. Do
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:59.440]   the good that you know to do and get busy. Because who knows if Stockman's right or not, but it sure
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.520]   feels to me like this last week was indeed a night that will live in infamy, at least for me.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:11.760]   Doesn't seem many other people paying attention to it, but for me, it was the final nail in the
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:22.400]   coffin of the idea that there's anybody in government who wants to spend less money.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:30.640]   Don't just dream about paradise, live it with Fiji Airways. Escape the ordinary with Fiji
