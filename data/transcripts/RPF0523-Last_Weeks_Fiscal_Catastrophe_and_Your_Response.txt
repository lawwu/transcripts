It's an interesting, I'm not sure whether that's a benefit for him or not, since President Reagan basically destroyed the fiscal situation in the United States worse than every president for him for years. And then since then, we've just been getting worse and worse and worse. He left Washington and he went on to work on Wall Street and now he basically focuses on publishing his newsletter.

[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.100]  obedience, and I will not be able to explain the difference between the two.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.100]   The first is that the industrial complex is now ruling the roost and has swallowed up most of the fiscal opposition, which was populated with neocons, militarists, and war hawks. That means, in turn, that it will be absolutely impossible to cut a single dime of domestic spending as far as the eye can see. Moreover, given the rather certain explosion of debt service costs to more than $1 trillion by the middle of the coming decade and the base of the economy, the industrial complex is now ruling the roost and has swallowed up most of the fiscal opposition, which was populated with neocons, militarists, and war hawks.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:48.120]   and then, of course, we have the federal outlays. In the most recent year completed, fiscal year 2017, federal outlays are heading toward 26.5% of GDP or higher. That compares to just 21% in the most recent year completed, fiscal year 2017. At the same time, the drastically front-loaded tax cut will reduce revenue to just 16.5% of GDP in the year ahead. The math of it is that the US is now heading for a 10% of GDP deficit on a long-run, long-term investment.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:13:18.140]   Worse still, there is now no process available to slow the drift toward calamity. As a result of last night's action on a two-year budget deal, the Congressional Republicans can now dispense with a budget resolution for fiscal year 2019 entirely, even though it is notionally required as a legal matter. That will spare them of the inconvenience of voting for a red-ink-saturated 10-year fiscal plan, along with the political shame of it. The Congressional Republicans can now dispense with a budget resolution for fiscal year 2019 entirely, even though it is notionally required as a legal matter.

[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.520]   the true fiscal facts will ultimately be a lot worse.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.700]   At the same time, no fiscal year 2019 budget resolution
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.900]   also means no chance whatsoever for entitlement reform,
